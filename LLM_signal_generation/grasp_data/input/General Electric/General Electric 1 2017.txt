By Georgina Prodhan

MUNICH, Germany, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Top European engineering group Siemens raised its earnings forecasts on Tuesday after its industrial business profit jumped in the fiscal first quarter, lifted by its factory automation unit.

The German trains-to-turbines company said it now expected an industrial profit margin of 11-12 percent for the year to end-September, versus its previous forecast for 10.5-11.5 percent. It made 13 percent in the first quarter.

Siemens' core industrial software division, Digital Factory, reported a 60 percent profit jump in profit and a margin of 26.1 percent, boosted by a one-off portfolio gain but also a 4 percent rise in sales driven by China.

That lifted group industrial profit 26 percent to 2.51 billion euros, well above the average estimate of 2.14 billion euros in a Reuters poll, even excluding the 172 million-euro gain. [nL5N1FG6OW]

Siemens did not say in its statement whether sales had also risen in the United States, as they did in the quarter for U.S. rival Rockwell Automation , whose stock has risen about 19 percent since Donald Trump was elected president on Nov. 8.

"We will continue to rigorously execute our strategy programme," said Chief Executive and former finance chief Joe Kaeser, under whose stewardship Siemens' past execution blunders and related large one-off charges have largely disappeared.

Siemens said it was ahead of schedule with an 8 billion-euro ($8.6 billion) electricity contract in Egypt, its largest single order to date, which is designed to boost the north African nation's power-generation capacity by 45 percent. [nFWN1FL0V1]

But first-quarter orders fell by a greater-than-expected 14 percent, partly reflecting the lack of a similar large contract this year but also a sharp drop in power and gas orders from Europe and the Middle East and a big decline in the Americas.

U.S. rival General Electric's orders in power-related equipment including gas turbines, where it competes with Siemens, fell 28 percent in the quarter, compared with a 40 percent drop for Siemens.

Siemens' first-quarter sales rose by a weaker-than-expected 3 percent on a comparable basis to 19.1 billion euros ($20.6 billion). The company stuck to its forecasts for "moderate" full-year sales growth and orders higher than sales.

It raised its earnings-per-share forecast to 7.20 to 7.70 euros from a previous 6.80 to 7.20 euros, after net profit jumped 25 percent to 1.94 billion euros.

Siemens gave no further details on plans for its healthcare division Healthineers, which it plans to list while keeping a majority stake, ahead of a press conference and annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday. ($1 = 0.9265 euros)

GE Oil and Gas CEO sees offshore activity pick up in 2018-19 - 路透新闻

{{20170131T070604.507+0000}}GE Oil and Gas CEO sees offshore activity pick up in 2018-19FLORENCE, Italy Jan 31 (Reuters) - Activity in offshore oil and gas fields is expected to pick up in 2018 and 2019 as companies revive investments after several years of low energy prices, Lorenzo Simonelli, chief executive of GE Oil and Gas told Reuters on Tuesday.

Simonelli, who said GE was on track to complete the merger of its oil and gas services with Baker Hughes in mid 2017, expects GE's activity in the sector to slow down this year versus 2016 as the projects pipeline dwindles.

"2017 is about rebuilding the backlog as you start seeing projects re-emerge in the second half of 2017," Simonelli told Reuters at the GE Oil and Gas annual meeting in Florence.

"We're already seeing some of our customers look at offshore, look at deepwater and we anticipate as you go out into 2018-19 the projects will start to happen."

BREAKINGVIEWS-Immigration ban hands U.S. firms dilemma - 路透新闻

{{20170130T180052.076+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Immigration ban hands U.S. firms dilemma(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Antony Currie

NEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The U.S. immigration ban hands a dilemma to the country's companies. Tech firms, Goldman Sachs , Starbucks and others may become political targets after criticizing a temporary White House block on entry by citizens from seven mostly Muslim states. But silence may alienate customers and future workers.

Speaking out against an edict that is draped in the flag of national security may increase the level of President Donald Trump's invective on Twitter and elsewhere. That already had corporate America walking on eggshells.

There's also the chance companies could lose business from customers who support Trump and his policies. After the November election, PepsiCo faced a boycott after Chief Executive Indra Nooyi said her daughters and some employees were "in mourning." Starbucks came in for similar criticism on Monday after its CEO, Howard Schultz, said the company would hire 10,000 refugees.

Yet keeping quiet carries risks, too. Angry customers bombarded Uber [UBER.UL] using the social-media hashtag #DeleteUber after the ride-hailing app failed to join a one-hour New York City taxi strike protesting against Trump's order. Boss Travis Kalanick later said Uber was donating $3 million to a legal fund for drivers facing immigration issues. Rival service Lyft had already donated $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union.

Many businesses seeking younger users and customers have spent years trying to appeal to millennials, and the younger generation Z, who expect them to show a social conscience. That's one reason why they have pledged better working conditions and committed to causes like fighting climate change and eradicating poverty, as well as speaking out against Indiana for its anti-gay legislation in 2015, for example.

Companies don't just need these digitally connected under-36 cohorts to buy their products – they also need to employ them. That fact, and a workforce reflecting many different nationalities, is why Silicon Valley is often on the front lines of the immigration debate. However, even Ford Motor on Monday said the travel ban "goes against our values." The company is engaged in a battle for tech talent for connected and driverless cars. Its headquarters are also near one of America's largest Arab populations.

Every company will have to balance its corporate goals with its top bosses' views, the interests of employees, and political concerns. Communications teams and crisis public-relations firms must be working overtime.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Over the weekend several Silicon Valley companies spoke out against President Donald Trump's Jan. 27 executive order that temporarily bars U.S. entry to citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries.

- Alphabet co-Chief Executive Sergey Brin joined protesters at San Francisco International Airport on Jan. 28. The company has also put on its homepage an image of Fred Korematsu, the American civil-rights lawyer who fought against the internment of Japanese-American citizens during World War Two. Along with Apple and Facebook , Alphabet also emailed employees to denounce the decree.

- Lyft donated $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union. Uber, after causing a backlash by not joining a one-hour New York City taxi strike to protest the edict, donated $3 million to a legal defense fund for drivers affected by immigration issues. Chief Executive Travis Kalanick, along with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, offered to take industry concerns about the ban to Trump's business advisory council, of which they are both members.

- Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz in an email to staff on Jan. 29 pledged to hire 10,000 refugees around the world. Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein told employees on Jan. 30: "This is not a policy we support." GE CEO Jeff Immelt said he shares his employees' "concern" about the ban.

UPDATE 1-Trump travel ban stirs faint corporate outcry beyond Silicon Valley - 路透新闻

{{20170130T135600.455+0000}}UPDATE 1-Trump travel ban stirs faint corporate outcry beyond Silicon Valley(Adds comments from Goldman Sachs' chief executive)

By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Ross Kerber

NEW YORK/BOSTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Most U.S. corporate
bosses have stayed silent on President Donald Trump's
immigration curbs, underscoring the sensitivities around
opposing policies that could provoke a backlash from the White
House.

While the leaders of Apple Inc , Google 
and Facebook Inc  emailed their staff to denounce the
suspension of the U.S. refugee program and the halting of
arrivals from seven Muslim-majority countries, many of their
counterparts in other industries either declined comment or
responded with company statements reiterating their commitment
to diversity.

The difference in response shows the pressure large swathes
of corporate America faces to avoid tussling publicly with the
new administration. [nL1N1EW19P]

Companies such as aircraft maker Boeing Co  and
automakers Ford Motor Co  and General Motors Co  have
already had run-ins with Trump over other issues, and they have
much at stake in policy decisions that the administration will
make on tax, trade and regulatory matters.

Before office, Trump attacked Boeing over the cost of the
future Air Force One program. Boeing Chief Executive Officer
Dennis Muilenburg met with him earlier this month and said he
and Trump had made progress on the Air Force One issue and the
potential sale of fighter aircraft. [nL1N1F710E]

Representatives from Boeing, General Motors and Ford
declined to comment on Trump's immigration curbs.

Wall Street, meanwhile, is hoping the new administration
will ease some of the regulations introduced in the wake of the
2007-08 financial crisis and adopt a lighter touch in their
enforcement.

Industries including banking, healthcare and auto
manufacturing "see themselves on the cusp of a new era of
deregulation, and they do not want to do anything that would
offend the new emperor," said Cornelius Hurley, director of
Boston University's Center for Finance, Law & Policy.

So far, Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman
Sachs , is the only major U.S. bank boss to speak out
directly against the executive order.

"This is not a policy we support," Blankfein said in a
message sent to staff on Sunday evening. "Being diverse is not
optional; it is what we must be."

Representatives of Citigroup Inc , Bank of America Corp
 and Morgan Stanley  declined to comment on Trump's
immigration order.

Wells Fargo & Co  said in a statement that it was
reviewing the executive order and its implications for staff and
its business.

JPMorgan Chase & Co's  Operating Committee, which
includes CEO Jamie Dimon, sent a note to staff saying it was
reaching out to all employees affected and noted that the
country was, "strengthened by the rich diversity of the world
around us."

To be sure, some CEOs were more outspoken.

Nike Inc  CEO Mark Parker said the company did not
support the executive order.

"Nike believes in a world where everyone celebrates the
power of diversity," he said in a statement. "Those values are
being threatened by the recent executive order in the U.S.
banning refugees, as well as visitors, from seven
Muslim-majority countries."

Brent Saunders, CEO of U.S. drugmaker Allergan Plc ,
tweeted: "Oppose any policy that puts limitations on our ability
to attract the best & diverse talent."

But many boardrooms kept quiet. Representatives for some
energy companies, including Exxon Mobil Corp , for
example, declined to comment.

GOOD CORPORATE CITIZENS

As the idea of corporate social responsibility has taken
root, so companies have increasingly championed a range of
causes, including gay rights, diverse workplaces and a global
view.

Many in corporate America are still trying to work out how
to deal with a new government that takes a more conservative
stance on some social issues and has an anti-globalization
platform.

Those non-tech companies that did issue statements over the
weekend tended to emphasize their role as good corporate
citizens rather than openly criticize Trump's policies.

Starbucks Corp  CEO Howard Schultz has put the
coffee chain in the national spotlight before, asking customers
not to bring guns into stores and urging conversations on race
relations.

In a letter to employees, he said Starbucks was developing
plans to hire 10,000 refugees over five years across dozens of
countries, but he did not directly criticize Trump's order.

"I am hearing the alarm you all are sounding that the
civility and human rights we have all taken for granted for so
long are under attack," he wrote.

In his statement, General Electric Co  CEO Jeff Immelt
told staff that the company would engage with the U.S.
government.

"We will continue to make our voice heard with the new
administration and Congress, and reiterate the importance of
this issue to GE and to the business community overall," he
wrote.

One of the most immediate ways for corporate bosses to
communicate with Trump about the immigration order will be the
first meeting of his advisory panel of business leaders next
week.

Of the 19 leaders on that panel, only two, Elon Musk, who
founded Tesla Motors Inc  and SpaceX, and Travis
Kalanick, CEO of Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], have spoken
out against Trump's immigration curbs.

A spokeswoman for Stephen Schwarzman, the billionaire chief
executive of Blackstone Group LP  whom Trump tasked to set
up and chair the panel, declined to comment.

citizens rather than openly criticize Trump's policies.

Starbucks Corp  CEO Howard Schultz has put the
coffee chain in the national spotlight before, asking customers
not to bring guns into stores and urging conversations on race
relations.

In a letter to employees, he said Starbucks was developing
plans to hire 10,000 refugees over five years across dozens of
countries, but he did not directly criticize Trump's order.

"I am hearing the alarm you all are sounding that the
civility and human rights we have all taken for granted for so
long are under attack," he wrote.

In his statement, General Electric Co  CEO Jeff Immelt
told staff that the company would engage with the U.S.
government.

"We will continue to make our voice heard with the new
administration and Congress, and reiterate the importance of
this issue to GE and to the business community overall," he
wrote.

One of the most immediate ways for corporate bosses to
communicate with Trump about the immigration order will be the
first meeting of his advisory panel of business leaders next
week.

Of the 19 leaders on that panel, only two, Elon Musk, who
founded Tesla Motors Inc  and SpaceX, and Travis
Kalanick, CEO of Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], have spoken
out against Trump's immigration curbs.

A spokeswoman for Stephen Schwarzman, the billionaire chief
executive of Blackstone Group LP  whom Trump tasked to set
up and chair the panel, declined to comment.

UPDATE 4-Baker Hughes says only higher oil prices will spur int'l spending - Reuters News

{{20170126T181559.839+0000}}UPDATE 4-Baker Hughes says only higher oil prices will spur int'l spending* Pegs int'l spending rise at Brent crude of $65/bbl

* Says US oil above mid-$50s/bbl to spur N. America spend

* Q4 loss bigger-than-expected due to higher tax rate

* Co forecasts another rev drop in N. America in Q1

* Shares down 1 percent, Oil prices up about 2 pct

(Adds details)

By Vishaka George and Swetha Gopinath

Jan 26 (Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes Inc , which is being acquired by General Electric Co , said crude oil prices would need to rise by roughly another 15 percent to spur producers to spend more on drilling outside North America.

Oil prices in the mid- to upper-$50s-per-barrel range would encourage North American producers, while prices above $65 per barrel would coax international producers to boost spending, Chief Executive Martin Craighead said.

U.S. crude oil futures were at nearly $54 per barrel at 1800 GMT on Thursday, while Brent prices were at $56.32.

While producers have put more rigs back to work in low-cost North American shale fields, such as the Permian Basin in Texas, due to higher oil prices, they have been reluctant to bet bigger on the expensive deepwater and mature oilfields outside the region.

But, Baker Hughes said its revenue from North America would fall again in the current quarter, which coupled with a bigger-than-expected fourth-quarter loss due to a higher tax rate, sent the company's shares down about 1 percent to $62.92.

Baker Hughes said its current-quarter North America revenue would be hurt by reduced activity in the Gulf of Mexico and the spin off of its pressure pumping business.

The company said it expects revenue from the region to rise over the first half of the year as producers ramp up onshore drilling, but said any pricing improvements would be limited as the market stays oversupplied.

The company expects its international revenue to fall by "mid to upper single digits" in percentage terms this quarter, reinforcing the subdued demand predicted by rivals Halliburton Co and Schlumberger NV .

Net loss attributable to Baker Hughes rose to $417 million in the fourth quarter from $1.03 billion a year earlier when it booked a $1.25 billion impairment charge. [nBwsqzt9a]

Excluding such items, it loss 30 cents per share, much more than analysts' average estimate of a 11 cents loss, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. At least six analysts said the difference was due to a higher tax rate.

Baker Hughes' revenue fell about 29 percent to $2.41 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $2.37 billion.

Revenue from its North America business fell nearly 32 percent, while revenue from other regions dropped nearly 29 percent, the company said.

GE said last week that revenue in its oil and gas business, which sells products for exploration and production, fell 22 percent in the latest quarter due to weak market conditions. [nL4N1FA43X]

Baker Hughes posts smaller quarterly loss - Reuters News

{{20170126T113614.825+0000}}Baker Hughes posts smaller quarterly lossJan 26 (Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes Inc , which is being acquired by General Electrical Co , said its fourth-quarter loss was smaller than a year ago, when it booked a $1.25 billion impairment charge.

Net loss attributable to Baker Hughes was $417 million, or 98 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $1.03 billion, or $2.35 per share, a year earlier. [nBwsqzt9a]

The latest quarter includes after-tax charges of $291 million.

Baker Hughes' revenue fell about 29 percent to $2.41 billion.

The merger between GE's oil and gas business and Baker Hughes will make the new company the No. 2 oilfield services provider, vaulting it ahead of Halliburton Co but still trailing Schlumberger NV . [nL4N1D13FG]

General Electric to have logo patch on Boston Celtics jerseys - Reuters News

{{20170125T174610.048+0000}}General Electric to have logo patch on Boston Celtics jerseysBy Tim Baysinger

Jan 25 (Reuters) - The Boston Celtics will wear General Electric Co's corporate logo on their jerseys during basketball games beginning next season, the NBA franchise announced on Wednesday.

The National Basketball Association is the first major North American pro sports league to allow advertising on game uniforms as a way to add another revenue stream, a practice that is far more common internationally.

The sponsorship is part of a three-year trial that will begin with the 2017-2018 season. GE moved its headquarters to Boston in 2016.

The Celtics are the third team to sell a jersey sponsorship, joining the Sacramento Kings and Philadelphia 76ers. The 76ers' jersey will be sponsored by online ticket exchange StubHub, while the Kings cut a deal with local agricultural brand, Blue Diamond Growers. All of the patches will appear on the front of the jerseys.

The Celtics' deal with GE covers the three years of the pilot program. Neither team has disclosed the value of the sponsorship, but media outlets ESPN and Sports Business Journal have reported the deals are going for roughly $5 million for each season.

Teams are responsible for selling their own sponsorship patches, which will be only 2.5 inches by 2.5 inches in size, much smaller than the kind used by European soccer clubs.

The sponsorship patch will not appear on the retail versions of the jerseys, though teams are permitted to sell sponsored-patch jerseys in their arena-owned retail outlets.

UPDATE 1-Siemens to pick banks for blockbuster Healthineers listing - sources - Reuters News

{{20170125T163014.493+0000}}UPDATE 1-Siemens to pick banks for blockbuster Healthineers listing - sources* Siemens to invite banks to pitch in April - sources

* Goldman already looking after some IPO preparations - sources

* Healthineers seen valued at 36-37 bln euros - analysts

(Adds further details on valuation, industry development)

By Arno Schuetze and Georgina Prodhan

FRANKFURT, Jan 24 (Reuters) - German industrial group Siemens will shortly start picking banks to organise a stock market listing of its healthcare business, which could be valued at up to 37 billion euros ($40 billion) including debt, three people close to the matter said.

Siemens will invite investment banks in early April to pitch for roles in the initial public offering (IPO), which could be the biggest since the flotation of German energy group Innogy in October, the people said.

They said that Goldman Sachs had already been asked to look after some preparatory tasks for the IPO.

"Goldman Sachs will very likely emerge as one of the global coordinators of the Healthineers IPO," one of the sources said, adding that Healthineers would be listed in late 2017 provided equity markets were favourable.

Siemens and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.

Analysts estimate the business, Siemens's most profitable, has an enterprise value of around 36 to 37 billion euros.

Barclays Capital, which rates Siemens "equal weight", estimates that that represents around 15 times 2018 earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA), compared with 10.4 times for the trains-to-turbines group as a whole.

"This is quite a high multiple factoring the strong cash generation and stable margin. However, top line growth has been muted and there are some headwinds ahead in both the U.S. and China, in our view," Barclays analyst James Stettler said.

Comparison with peers is difficult as they are divisions of conglomerates General Electric , Philips and Toshiba <6502.T>.

Potential investors in the IPO may compare Healthineers to Baxter , Boston Scientific , Ambu and Dentsply Sirona - which trade at 17 to 30 times their core earnings - when making their decisions on how much they are willing to pay.

INVESTMENT NEEDED

The IPO of a minority stake in Healthineers would give Siemens a currency for organic or inorganic investment in the business, which is a market leader in diagnostic imaging but needs to adapt fast to boost its exposure to growth segments.

These include molecular diagnostics, which involves analysing patients' genetic make-up to help doctors with diagnosis, prognosis and treatment options, as well as advanced therapies and bespoke hospital services.

This will not be cheap. U.S. medical technology group Danaher in November bought fast-growing but loss-making Californian molecular diagnostics market leader Cepheid for $4 billion including debt, or just over six times sales, at a premium of 54 percent. [nL3N1BI3DQ]

"This (flotation) is the best option and the logical next step to provide flexible access to the capital markets and further strengthen the Healthineers business in the future," Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser told investors on a call in November.

Analysts say GenMark Diagnostics and Oxford Immunotec Global are future logical takeover targets in the sector.

Siemens is now developing a next-generation lab diagnostics system, named Atellica, designed to leapfrog competitors such as Roche and Abbott , but the move is expected to dilute profit margins for around two years.

Last month, Siemens announced a $300 million investment and 700 new jobs at its Walpole, Massachusetts laboratory diagnostics manufacturing facility over the next four years to manufacture assays for Atellica. [nFWN1E90D5]

Analysts say Healthineers - which accounts for about 30 percent of divisional sales - has underperformed both its peers and expectations since Siemens created it in the last decade.

It posted sales of 13.5 billion euros in the fiscal year to end-September, an increase of 5 percent. It had an EBIT margin of 17.2 percent, an improvement on the previous year's 16.9 percent and the highest of any Siemens business.

It has about 46,000 employees worldwide.

INTERVIEW-Production problems were a factor in Zodiac agreeing to takeover-shareholder - Reuters News

{{20170120T084306.506+0000}}INTERVIEW-Production problems were a factor in Zodiac agreeing to takeover-shareholderBy Gilles Guillaume

PARIS, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Recent production problems at Zodiac Aerospace partially influenced the French seatmaker's decision to agree to be taken over by aero engines group Safran , a leading Zodiac shareholder said.

A cash pile left by Safran's decision last year to sell its security business also facilitated the 9.7 billion-euro ($10.4 billion) deal, reached more than six years after Zodiac's core shareholders spurned a previous approach by Safran. [nL5N1F90RB]

"What has changed (since 2010) is the pursuit of growth by both companies (and) the fact that Safran sold Morpho and had the means to fund an acquisition strategy," Robert Peugeot, head of the French carmaking dynasty's holding company, told Reuters.

"On the Zodiac side, the industrial difficulties it has faced, and which much of the industry is facing, meant that the idea of adopting an industrial logic based on being part of a larger entity seemed to us like a good idea."

Zodiac is emerging from a production crisis at its seat plants. It is controlled by a group of families including the Peugeot investment vehicle, FFP, which owns 5.2 percent.

In a two-part deal announced on Thursday, Safran will make a cash offer valuing Zodiac at 8.5 billion euros.

That will be followed by a merger in which core family shareholders will tender their shares in exchange for a stake in the enlarged group. Safran shareholders will also receive a special dividend.

Analysts valued the overall cash and paper transaction at 9.7 billion euros.

Peugeot defended the decision, criticised by some analysts, not to seek other bids.

"The success of this operation also depends on the capacity of teams to understand each other and work together. There is a proximity between the companies that will certainly facilitate synergies and integration into one company," he said.

The French government, which owns 14 percent of Safran, was also involved in the merger discussions, Peugeot said. French President Francois Hollande welcomed the deal to create the world's third largest aerospace industry supplier behind United Technologies (UTC) and General Electric .

"It is a French champion in a global sector that is developing and will probably continue to do so for quite a few years," Peugeot said.

The merger, he said, also reflected a shift towards car industry methods as planemakers gear up for the higher production volumes needed to deliver on a boom in orders.

"It is clear that aerospace is moving towards a modus operandi closer to automobiles, where the large manufacturers like to have large suppliers covering the world and capable of efficiently managing their industrial processes."

However, some analysts believe that trend is coming to an end after a series of major tie-ups and that consolidation is shifting to lower-tier suppliers. Airbus and Boeing both signalled alarm about an abortive bid by aerospace giant Honeywell for United Technologies last year. [nL2N166044] Peugeot played down the impact of an agreement last October for Rockwell Collins to absorb Zodiac's main rival, B/E Aerospace of the United States. Asked whether this had sped up the talks, he said, "No, it was part of the context". ($1=0.9361 euros)

Nason, former Treasury official, being vetted for Fed role -sources - Reuters News

{{20170120T022617.132+0000}}Nason, former Treasury official, being vetted for Fed role -sourcesBy Patrick Rucker and Olivia Oran

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, Jan 19 (Reuters) - David Nason, a General Electric executive and former Treasury Department official, is the front runner to become the Federal Reserve's top Wall Street regulator under President-elect Donald Trump, sources familiar with the screening said on Thursday.

Nason leads GE's Energy Financial Services division, which funds worldwide energy development, mostly from thermal and renewable sources.

In 2008, Nason was a deputy to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson as U.S. regulators tried to stabilize Wall Street and prevent an economic meltdown after the housing market collapsed.

Trump will have a chance to nominate the Fed's vice chair for supervision - a role conceived in the wake of the financial collapse to watchdog Wall Street.

If Nason is tapped for the role, he would be the most senior rule-writer for Wall Street with a large say in how leading banks are supervised day to day.

In recent weeks, other names have been floated as vice chair candidates who can boast support from Wall Street.

Representative French Hill, an Arkansas Republican and former banker, has been favored by some in the banking industry while some Washington lobbyists have favored Paul Atkins, a former commissioner with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

While no final decision has been made on who should fill the job, Nason has Paulson's backing and has become the front runner in recent weeks, the sources said.

In the last several weeks, Nason has met with Trump's senior economic advisers Gary Cohn and Steve Mnuchin, according to one source familiar with the meetings.

A Trump spokesperson declined to comment.

Trump has named Cohn as head of the White House National Economic Council and nominated Mnuchin as Treasury secretary.

Both Cohn and Mnuchin held senior roles at Goldman Sachs , and they have heard directly from Paulson, the company's former chief executive, that Nason is a solid pick, according to another source familiar with the screening.

Nason did not immediately respond to a call for comment. A spokesman for Paulson declined to comment.

In Paulson's memoir, "On the Brink," the former cabinet secretary singles Nason out for praise during the financial crisis.

UK spent $207 mln on failed carbon capture initiatives -watchdog - Reuters News

{{20170120T000101.394+0000}}UK spent $207 mln on failed carbon capture initiatives -watchdog* CCS technology deemed crucial to meet climate targets

* Government needs to restore investor confidence in CCS -watchdog

LONDON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Britain spent 168 million pounds ($207 million) on two failed initiatives to help to fund carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, a parliamentary watchdog said on Friday.

CCS involves the capture of emissions from power plants and industry to allow them to be stored underground and had been viewed by the British government as a vital to help it to meet emissions targets, but two competitions held over the past ten years have failed to produce a commercial-scale project.

A report by the National Audit Office (NAO), focusing on the second competition, said that the 100 million pounds spent had not provided value for money.

"Taxpayers will be alarmed that disagreement between departments means the taxpayers have little to show for the 100 million pounds the government spent," Meg Hillier, Chair of the Committee of Public Accounts, said in statement with the report.

The first competition, which cost 68 million pounds, collapsed in 2011 when a consortium including National Grid and Iberdrola's Scottish Power pulled out.

The second competition's demise came when the government unexpectedly cancelled its funding in 2015. [nL8N13K4AR]

The NAO said that the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) -- which has since become part of the new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) -- began the second CCS competition without agreeing on costs with Britain's finance ministry.

The cancellation halted development of the two major projects involved, being developed by companies including SSE , Shell , GE and BOC, part of the Linde Group .

"The government will have to work hard to restore investor confidence in carbon capture and storage, or come up with cost-effective alternatives to meet the UK's decarbonisation target," Hillier said.

In 2015 the DECC said that meeting the country's 2050 carbon dioxide reduction target would cost 30 billion pounds without deployment of CCS in the power sector.

"The Department (BEIS) must learn lessons from this experience if it is to stand any chance of ensuring the first CCS plants are built in the near future," said Amyas Morse, head of the NAO.

Britain has a legally binding target to cut emissions by 80 percent from 1990 levels by 2050.

Investors are looking ahead to the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, who will be
sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. After hitting a series of record highs in a
post-election rally, Wall Street has been trading in a tight range as investors look for more
details on Trump's policies.

Industrial conglomerate General Electric Co is expected to report higher revenue and profit for
the fourth quarter, helped by strength in its healthcare, aviation and renewable energy
businesses. Investors will look for an update on its full-year financial forecasts and comments
on how President-elect Donald Trump's policies could affect GE's operations.

Procter & Gamble Co, the maker of Tide detergent and Gillette shaving products, is expected to
report a fall in its second-quarter sales as a strong dollar ate into its revenue from outside
the United States. Analysts will look out for guidance, potential deals and comments on its
business in the United Kingdom.

Schlumberger NV, the world's No.1 oilfield services provider, is likely to report a
fourth-quarter profit, compared with a loss a year ago, when it recorded more than $2 billion in
restructuring and asset impairment charges. The focus this quarter will be on the company's
ability to recover pricing concessions it gave since the slump in oil prices started in
mid-2014. With oil prices on the rise now, Schlumberger is widely expected to raise prices for
its services, boosting revenue.

Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker speaks on the economic outlook
before the New Jersey Bankers Association 6th Annual NJ Economic Leadership Forum, in Somerset,
N.J. (0900/1400). Later, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams will give
his economic outlook for 2017, in what is likely to be the last read on his views before the
U.S. central bank has its first policy making meeting under President Donald Trump. The closing
remarks before the Bay Area Council 10th Annual Economic Forecast event in San Francisco will
likely be a repeat of Williams's comments earlier in the week, but audience questions could
provoke some fresh observations from the closely-watched policymaker. (1300/1800)

Canada's inflation data is likely to show that annual inflation rose in December to 1.7 percent
from a rate of 1.2 percent in November. (0830/1330) Data from Statistics Canada is expected to
show that retail sales in November rose 0.5 percent. (0830/1330)

RPT-U.S. investors see more automation, not jobs, under Trump administration - Reuters News

{{20170119T120001.756+0000}}RPT-U.S. investors see more automation, not jobs, under Trump administration(Repeats story that ran earlier with no change to headline or text)

By David Randall

NEW YORK, Jan 19 (Reuters) - When U.S. President-elect Donald Trump criticized United Technologies Corp's Carrier unit in November for its plan to move some 800 jobs to Mexico, the parent-company made a swift decision to keep the factory in Indiana.

Yet, the move did not translate into saving jobs. Instead, the company decided it would move toward automation as a way to cut costs.

"We're going to make up [the] $16 million investment in that factory in Indianapolis to automate, to drive the cost down so that we can continue to be competitive," chief executive Greg Hayes said on CNBC last month. "What that ultimately means is there will be fewer jobs."

Swapping robots and software for human labor has underpinned much of the productivity gains in the United States over the last 25 years. Now, with a greater political push to keep factories at home, investors are betting that automation will gain speed in industries ranging from auto manufacturing to chicken processing to craft beer breweries.

The big winners so far include Rockwell Automation Inc , General Electric Co and Cognex Corp , which have seen jumps in fund ownership of 80 percent or more in the current quarter compared with the previous quarter, according to a Reuters analysis of Morningstar data.

The ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF is up 7.5 percent since Election Day, or about 15 percent more than the S&P 500 index, after underperforming the broad market for the majority of last year. Its largest holdings include cleaning products maker iRobot Corp , Japanese factory automation company Fanuc Corp< 6954.T>, and drone aircraft company AeroVironment Inc .

But the push toward automation could also cut into the number of jobs saved or created in the United States, undercutting Trump's boast in a news conference last Wednesday that he would be "the greatest jobs producer that God ever created." [L1N1F112E]

CUTTING LABOR COSTS

Declining costs of technology are expected to accelerate the growth of robotic manufacturing. Some 80 percent of companies that plan to cut jobs in the next year expect to partially replace workers with automation, according to a survey of chief executives by PwC released Monday.

At the same time, developments in fields ranging from barcodes to digital measurement tools are allowing companies to hire fewer workers and reduce the time it takes to bring their products to the market.

Brian Smoluch, a fund manager at the Portland, Oregon-based Hood River Small-Cap Growth fund , has been buying shares of Digimarc Corp because of its so-called invisible barcodes that speed up scanning of packages.

"If it takes a nanosecond to scan something, it allows a retailer to have fewer people at a checkout counter and makes self-checkout an easier proposition," he said. That said, the $300 million market cap company is a "high-risk, high-reward stock" because its success depends on companies adopting its technology over rivals.

Eric Marshall, a fund manager at Dallas-based Hodges Capital, has been buying shares of digital measurement company FARO Technologies Inc and kitchen equipment maker Middleby Corp .

Faro, for instance, creates three-dimensional measuring tools used in aerospace and automotive manufacturing. Shares of the company are up 18.8 percent since Election Day, triple the 6.3 percent gain in the broad S&P 500 index.

Middleby, meanwhile, recently introduced robots which can prepare French fries as quickly as a human line cook, saving labor costs and improving reliability. Shares are up 12.8 percent since Election Day.

"As labor costs go up you're going to see more automated kitchens within fast-casual restaurants, and Middleby is one of the key innovators in that industry," Marshall said.

MADE IN THE USA

Republicans are likely to push tax policies that provide incentives to manufacture goods in the United States, regardless how the work is done, analysts say.

The result could be that there are more goods made at home, without a significant reduction in the unemployment rate, which is currently at 4.7 percent as of December.

"There could be a manufacturing renaissance in this country, but most of the work will be done by automation, with current workers retained to do value-added functions," said Nicholas Heymann, analyst at William Blair who covers General Electric and expects it to be a boon to the company's automation business.

Australia's AGL lines up funding for $340 mln wind farm - Reuters News

{{20170119T010138.701+0000}}Australia's AGL lines up funding for $340 mln wind farmBy Byron Kaye

SYDNEY, Jan 19 (Reuters) - AGL Energy Ltd , Australia's No. 2 energy retailer, said on Thursday it will build a A$450 million ($338 million) wind farm in the first construction project for a new renewable energy-focused fund, backed by the government.

The move marks a small step forward in the Australian energy industry's push to expand in renewables, while still depending heavily on coal-fired plants, as the country races to meet its global commitment to cut carbon emissions.

Lining up finance for large-scale renewable energy projects has been an obstacle, with banks reluctant to back proposals due to uncertainty over Australia's energy policies and climate-change commitments amid a string of leadership changes in Canberra.

AGL, the country's biggest carbon emitter, set up the $1 billion Powering Australian Renewables Fund (PARF) last year, with 80 percent of the equity provided by Australia's sovereign wealth fund, the Future Fund, and Queensland state's QIC.

"The momentum we're experiencing with PARF is pleasing and proves that investor support exists for large-scale renewables development," AGL Chief Executive Officer Andy Vesey said in a statement.

AGL transferred two solar plants into the fund. The 200-megawatt Silverton Wind Farm in outback New South Wales state will be the first new project to be built by the fund, with loans from Westpac Banking Corp, National Australia Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Societe Generale and DBS Bank.

The Australian arm of GE said it will supply 58 massive wind turbines for the project, and will work with engineering firm CATCON to build the wind farm.

Once complete in 2018, the Silverton wind farm will generate about a fifth of the fund's target of 1,000 megawatts of renewable energy, or 4 percent of the energy needed to meet the Australian government's renewables target for 2020, AGL said.

It said the facility, which would be Australia's sixth largest wind farm, will effectively cut the company's carbon emissions by 655,000 tonnes a year, the equivalent of taking 192,000 cars off the road.

AGL plans to exit coal-fired generation only by 2050, while expanding in wind and solar power, but is quitting the coal-seam gas business as low oil prices and community opposition have hurt the economics of its projects.

INTERVIEW-Production problems were a factor in Zodiac agreeing to takeover-shareholder - Reuters News

{{20170120T084306.506+0000}}INTERVIEW-Production problems were a factor in Zodiac agreeing to takeover-shareholderBy Gilles Guillaume

PARIS, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Recent production problems at Zodiac Aerospace partially influenced the French seatmaker's decision to agree to be taken over by aero engines group Safran , a leading Zodiac shareholder said.

A cash pile left by Safran's decision last year to sell its security business also facilitated the 9.7 billion-euro ($10.4 billion) deal, reached more than six years after Zodiac's core shareholders spurned a previous approach by Safran. [nL5N1F90RB]

"What has changed (since 2010) is the pursuit of growth by both companies (and) the fact that Safran sold Morpho and had the means to fund an acquisition strategy," Robert Peugeot, head of the French carmaking dynasty's holding company, told Reuters.

"On the Zodiac side, the industrial difficulties it has faced, and which much of the industry is facing, meant that the idea of adopting an industrial logic based on being part of a larger entity seemed to us like a good idea."

Zodiac is emerging from a production crisis at its seat plants. It is controlled by a group of families including the Peugeot investment vehicle, FFP, which owns 5.2 percent.

In a two-part deal announced on Thursday, Safran will make a cash offer valuing Zodiac at 8.5 billion euros.

That will be followed by a merger in which core family shareholders will tender their shares in exchange for a stake in the enlarged group. Safran shareholders will also receive a special dividend.

Analysts valued the overall cash and paper transaction at 9.7 billion euros.

Peugeot defended the decision, criticised by some analysts, not to seek other bids.

"The success of this operation also depends on the capacity of teams to understand each other and work together. There is a proximity between the companies that will certainly facilitate synergies and integration into one company," he said.

The French government, which owns 14 percent of Safran, was also involved in the merger discussions, Peugeot said. French President Francois Hollande welcomed the deal to create the world's third largest aerospace industry supplier behind United Technologies (UTC) and General Electric .

"It is a French champion in a global sector that is developing and will probably continue to do so for quite a few years," Peugeot said.

The merger, he said, also reflected a shift towards car industry methods as planemakers gear up for the higher production volumes needed to deliver on a boom in orders.

"It is clear that aerospace is moving towards a modus operandi closer to automobiles, where the large manufacturers like to have large suppliers covering the world and capable of efficiently managing their industrial processes."

However, some analysts believe that trend is coming to an end after a series of major tie-ups and that consolidation is shifting to lower-tier suppliers. Airbus and Boeing both signalled alarm about an abortive bid by aerospace giant Honeywell for United Technologies last year. [nL2N166044] Peugeot played down the impact of an agreement last October for Rockwell Collins to absorb Zodiac's main rival, B/E Aerospace of the United States. Asked whether this had sped up the talks, he said, "No, it was part of the context". ($1=0.9361 euros)

Nason, former Treasury official, being vetted for Fed role -sources - Reuters News

{{20170120T022617.132+0000}}Nason, former Treasury official, being vetted for Fed role -sourcesBy Patrick Rucker and Olivia Oran

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, Jan 19 (Reuters) - David Nason, a General Electric executive and former Treasury Department official, is the front runner to become the Federal Reserve's top Wall Street regulator under President-elect Donald Trump, sources familiar with the screening said on Thursday.

Nason leads GE's Energy Financial Services division, which funds worldwide energy development, mostly from thermal and renewable sources.

In 2008, Nason was a deputy to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson as U.S. regulators tried to stabilize Wall Street and prevent an economic meltdown after the housing market collapsed.

Trump will have a chance to nominate the Fed's vice chair for supervision - a role conceived in the wake of the financial collapse to watchdog Wall Street.

If Nason is tapped for the role, he would be the most senior rule-writer for Wall Street with a large say in how leading banks are supervised day to day.

In recent weeks, other names have been floated as vice chair candidates who can boast support from Wall Street.

Representative French Hill, an Arkansas Republican and former banker, has been favored by some in the banking industry while some Washington lobbyists have favored Paul Atkins, a former commissioner with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

While no final decision has been made on who should fill the job, Nason has Paulson's backing and has become the front runner in recent weeks, the sources said.

In the last several weeks, Nason has met with Trump's senior economic advisers Gary Cohn and Steve Mnuchin, according to one source familiar with the meetings.

A Trump spokesperson declined to comment.

Trump has named Cohn as head of the White House National Economic Council and nominated Mnuchin as Treasury secretary.

Both Cohn and Mnuchin held senior roles at Goldman Sachs , and they have heard directly from Paulson, the company's former chief executive, that Nason is a solid pick, according to another source familiar with the screening.

Nason did not immediately respond to a call for comment. A spokesman for Paulson declined to comment.

In Paulson's memoir, "On the Brink," the former cabinet secretary singles Nason out for praise during the financial crisis.

UK spent $207 mln on failed carbon capture initiatives -watchdog - Reuters News

{{20170120T000101.394+0000}}UK spent $207 mln on failed carbon capture initiatives -watchdog* CCS technology deemed crucial to meet climate targets

* Government needs to restore investor confidence in CCS -watchdog

LONDON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Britain spent 168 million pounds ($207 million) on two failed initiatives to help to fund carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, a parliamentary watchdog said on Friday.

CCS involves the capture of emissions from power plants and industry to allow them to be stored underground and had been viewed by the British government as a vital to help it to meet emissions targets, but two competitions held over the past ten years have failed to produce a commercial-scale project.

A report by the National Audit Office (NAO), focusing on the second competition, said that the 100 million pounds spent had not provided value for money.

"Taxpayers will be alarmed that disagreement between departments means the taxpayers have little to show for the 100 million pounds the government spent," Meg Hillier, Chair of the Committee of Public Accounts, said in statement with the report.

The first competition, which cost 68 million pounds, collapsed in 2011 when a consortium including National Grid and Iberdrola's Scottish Power pulled out.

The second competition's demise came when the government unexpectedly cancelled its funding in 2015. [nL8N13K4AR]

The NAO said that the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) -- which has since become part of the new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) -- began the second CCS competition without agreeing on costs with Britain's finance ministry.

The cancellation halted development of the two major projects involved, being developed by companies including SSE , Shell , GE and BOC, part of the Linde Group .

"The government will have to work hard to restore investor confidence in carbon capture and storage, or come up with cost-effective alternatives to meet the UK's decarbonisation target," Hillier said.

In 2015 the DECC said that meeting the country's 2050 carbon dioxide reduction target would cost 30 billion pounds without deployment of CCS in the power sector.

"The Department (BEIS) must learn lessons from this experience if it is to stand any chance of ensuring the first CCS plants are built in the near future," said Amyas Morse, head of the NAO.

Britain has a legally binding target to cut emissions by 80 percent from 1990 levels by 2050.

Investors are looking ahead to the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, who will be
sworn in as the 45th president of the United States. After hitting a series of record highs in a
post-election rally, Wall Street has been trading in a tight range as investors look for more
details on Trump's policies.

Industrial conglomerate General Electric Co is expected to report higher revenue and profit for
the fourth quarter, helped by strength in its healthcare, aviation and renewable energy
businesses. Investors will look for an update on its full-year financial forecasts and comments
on how President-elect Donald Trump's policies could affect GE's operations.

Procter & Gamble Co, the maker of Tide detergent and Gillette shaving products, is expected to
report a fall in its second-quarter sales as a strong dollar ate into its revenue from outside
the United States. Analysts will look out for guidance, potential deals and comments on its
business in the United Kingdom.

Schlumberger NV, the world's No.1 oilfield services provider, is likely to report a
fourth-quarter profit, compared with a loss a year ago, when it recorded more than $2 billion in
restructuring and asset impairment charges. The focus this quarter will be on the company's
ability to recover pricing concessions it gave since the slump in oil prices started in
mid-2014. With oil prices on the rise now, Schlumberger is widely expected to raise prices for
its services, boosting revenue.

Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker speaks on the economic outlook
before the New Jersey Bankers Association 6th Annual NJ Economic Leadership Forum, in Somerset,
N.J. (0900/1400). Later, San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams will give
his economic outlook for 2017, in what is likely to be the last read on his views before the
U.S. central bank has its first policy making meeting under President Donald Trump. The closing
remarks before the Bay Area Council 10th Annual Economic Forecast event in San Francisco will
likely be a repeat of Williams's comments earlier in the week, but audience questions could
provoke some fresh observations from the closely-watched policymaker. (1300/1800)

Canada's inflation data is likely to show that annual inflation rose in December to 1.7 percent
from a rate of 1.2 percent in November. (0830/1330) Data from Statistics Canada is expected to
show that retail sales in November rose 0.5 percent. (0830/1330)

RPT-U.S. investors see more automation, not jobs, under Trump administration - Reuters News

{{20170119T120001.756+0000}}RPT-U.S. investors see more automation, not jobs, under Trump administration(Repeats story that ran earlier with no change to headline or text)

By David Randall

NEW YORK, Jan 19 (Reuters) - When U.S. President-elect Donald Trump criticized United Technologies Corp's Carrier unit in November for its plan to move some 800 jobs to Mexico, the parent-company made a swift decision to keep the factory in Indiana.

Yet, the move did not translate into saving jobs. Instead, the company decided it would move toward automation as a way to cut costs.

"We're going to make up [the] $16 million investment in that factory in Indianapolis to automate, to drive the cost down so that we can continue to be competitive," chief executive Greg Hayes said on CNBC last month. "What that ultimately means is there will be fewer jobs."

Swapping robots and software for human labor has underpinned much of the productivity gains in the United States over the last 25 years. Now, with a greater political push to keep factories at home, investors are betting that automation will gain speed in industries ranging from auto manufacturing to chicken processing to craft beer breweries.

The big winners so far include Rockwell Automation Inc , General Electric Co and Cognex Corp , which have seen jumps in fund ownership of 80 percent or more in the current quarter compared with the previous quarter, according to a Reuters analysis of Morningstar data.

The ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF is up 7.5 percent since Election Day, or about 15 percent more than the S&P 500 index, after underperforming the broad market for the majority of last year. Its largest holdings include cleaning products maker iRobot Corp , Japanese factory automation company Fanuc Corp< 6954.T>, and drone aircraft company AeroVironment Inc .

But the push toward automation could also cut into the number of jobs saved or created in the United States, undercutting Trump's boast in a news conference last Wednesday that he would be "the greatest jobs producer that God ever created." [L1N1F112E]

CUTTING LABOR COSTS

Declining costs of technology are expected to accelerate the growth of robotic manufacturing. Some 80 percent of companies that plan to cut jobs in the next year expect to partially replace workers with automation, according to a survey of chief executives by PwC released Monday.

At the same time, developments in fields ranging from barcodes to digital measurement tools are allowing companies to hire fewer workers and reduce the time it takes to bring their products to the market.

Brian Smoluch, a fund manager at the Portland, Oregon-based Hood River Small-Cap Growth fund , has been buying shares of Digimarc Corp because of its so-called invisible barcodes that speed up scanning of packages.

"If it takes a nanosecond to scan something, it allows a retailer to have fewer people at a checkout counter and makes self-checkout an easier proposition," he said. That said, the $300 million market cap company is a "high-risk, high-reward stock" because its success depends on companies adopting its technology over rivals.

Eric Marshall, a fund manager at Dallas-based Hodges Capital, has been buying shares of digital measurement company FARO Technologies Inc and kitchen equipment maker Middleby Corp .

Faro, for instance, creates three-dimensional measuring tools used in aerospace and automotive manufacturing. Shares of the company are up 18.8 percent since Election Day, triple the 6.3 percent gain in the broad S&P 500 index.

Middleby, meanwhile, recently introduced robots which can prepare French fries as quickly as a human line cook, saving labor costs and improving reliability. Shares are up 12.8 percent since Election Day.

"As labor costs go up you're going to see more automated kitchens within fast-casual restaurants, and Middleby is one of the key innovators in that industry," Marshall said.

MADE IN THE USA

Republicans are likely to push tax policies that provide incentives to manufacture goods in the United States, regardless how the work is done, analysts say.

The result could be that there are more goods made at home, without a significant reduction in the unemployment rate, which is currently at 4.7 percent as of December.

"There could be a manufacturing renaissance in this country, but most of the work will be done by automation, with current workers retained to do value-added functions," said Nicholas Heymann, analyst at William Blair who covers General Electric and expects it to be a boon to the company's automation business.

Australia's AGL lines up funding for $340 mln wind farm - Reuters News

{{20170119T010138.701+0000}}Australia's AGL lines up funding for $340 mln wind farmBy Byron Kaye

SYDNEY, Jan 19 (Reuters) - AGL Energy Ltd , Australia's No. 2 energy retailer, said on Thursday it will build a A$450 million ($338 million) wind farm in the first construction project for a new renewable energy-focused fund, backed by the government.

The move marks a small step forward in the Australian energy industry's push to expand in renewables, while still depending heavily on coal-fired plants, as the country races to meet its global commitment to cut carbon emissions.

Lining up finance for large-scale renewable energy projects has been an obstacle, with banks reluctant to back proposals due to uncertainty over Australia's energy policies and climate-change commitments amid a string of leadership changes in Canberra.

AGL, the country's biggest carbon emitter, set up the $1 billion Powering Australian Renewables Fund (PARF) last year, with 80 percent of the equity provided by Australia's sovereign wealth fund, the Future Fund, and Queensland state's QIC.

"The momentum we're experiencing with PARF is pleasing and proves that investor support exists for large-scale renewables development," AGL Chief Executive Officer Andy Vesey said in a statement.

AGL transferred two solar plants into the fund. The 200-megawatt Silverton Wind Farm in outback New South Wales state will be the first new project to be built by the fund, with loans from Westpac Banking Corp, National Australia Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Societe Generale and DBS Bank.

The Australian arm of GE said it will supply 58 massive wind turbines for the project, and will work with engineering firm CATCON to build the wind farm.

Once complete in 2018, the Silverton wind farm will generate about a fifth of the fund's target of 1,000 megawatts of renewable energy, or 4 percent of the energy needed to meet the Australian government's renewables target for 2020, AGL said.

It said the facility, which would be Australia's sixth largest wind farm, will effectively cut the company's carbon emissions by 655,000 tonnes a year, the equivalent of taking 192,000 cars off the road.

AGL plans to exit coal-fired generation only by 2050, while expanding in wind and solar power, but is quitting the coal-seam gas business as low oil prices and community opposition have hurt the economics of its projects.

INTERVIEW-Qatar Airways pressures engine maker, sees early Boeing 777-9 - Reuters News

{{20170112T230829.930+0000}}INTERVIEW-Qatar Airways pressures engine maker, sees early Boeing 777-9(Recasts; adds Boeing comment)

By Tim Hepher

PARIS, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Qatar Airways said on Thursday it was seeking guarantees from a potential new engine supplier after delays to Airbus jet deliveries, but said Boeing was ahead of schedule on its latest version of the 777, leaving scope to bring those jets forward.

The comments from one of the industry's toughest buyers reflect the stakes involved in meeting manufacturing targets for large aerospace industry orders after a series of costly delays.

Qatar Airways remains in talks with CFM International about supplying engines for an upgraded order for Airbus Group's A321neo medium-haul jets, which it expects to finalise "soon", Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker told Reuters.

The carrier has cancelled four A320neo jets powered by delayed engines made by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies , and plans to swap the overall aircraft order, which originally covered 50 jets, to the larger A321neo.

CFM, owned by General Electric and France's Safran , competes with Pratt & Whitney to power Airbus' medium-haul jets.

Al Baker acknowledged Qatar had received competitive launch prices when it originally ordered Pratt & Whitney engines, but said a decision on whether to keep those or switch to CFM for the upgraded A321neo order would depend on other guarantees.

"It is a factor, but what we decide will be based on what sort of guarantees we get on deliveries and at the same time performance," he said in an interview.

Qatar plans to take delivery of around 10 Airbus A350s and 6 Boeing 777s this year. It will also receive some Boeing 737s on behalf of Italy's Meridiana, in which it aims to buy 49 percent.

Qatar is also one of the launch customers for the newest Boeing long-haul jet, the 777-9, formerly code-named 777-9X.

Boeing plans to deliver the 406-seat jet from 2020, but aviation news site FlightGlobal reported last year it could advance deliveries to late 2019 due to spare cushion in the development schedule.

"We have already told Boeing that as they are bringing ahead the (777-)9X deliveries, we would be interested. The 777-9X programme is ahead of schedule and we have no problem if they want to bring our deliveries ahead," Al Baker said.

A Boeing spokesman said: "Development of the 777X programme is progressing to plan and we will deliver to the schedule we committed to our airline customers."

FUEL SURCHARGES

Al Baker was speaking after opening a 1,000-square-metre lounge at Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport, the airline's third such facility abroad after London Heathrow and Dubai.

It is also building lounges in Beirut and Bangkok and negotiating space in seven other airports.

The expansion comes as Gulf airlines have seen premium yields suffering due to low oil prices and rising capacity.

Qatar Airways plans to unveil a new premium cabin in March and is investing an unspecified amount to attract passengers "with the right yield," Al Baker said.

But he suggested fuel surcharges may soon be back on the agenda.

"(Qatar Airways) had to lower (prices in 2016) because oil prices were going down, but now we are starting to put prices up because oil prices are starting to go up," he said.

"Soon, I think not only Qatar Airways but most of the airlines will re-introduce the fuel surcharges because they budgeted on lower fuel price and prices are now rising rapidly."

Oil prices have risen 20 percent in three months. [O/R]

Al Baker said the airline had not seen traffic to France fall after recent attacks. The carrier plans to serve Nice five times per week from July and expects to announce a similar service to Lyon soon.

It also continues to experience double-digit growth in passenger numbers, Al Baker added.

INTERVIEW-Qatar Airways seeks engine guarantees for revamped Airbus order - Reuters News

{{20170112T133943.750+0000}}INTERVIEW-Qatar Airways seeks engine guarantees for revamped Airbus order(Adds details)

By Tim Hepher

PARIS, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Qatar Airways is seeking strict guarantees as it talks to CFM International about supplying engines for a revamped order for Airbus narrow-body jets, which it expects to finalise "soon", its chief executive said on Thursday.

The Gulf airline has cancelled four A320neo jets powered by alternative Pratt & Whitney engines and expects to swap the overall aircraft order, which was originally for 50 jets, to larger A321neo aircraft.

CFM, a joint venture of General Electric and France's Safran , is locked in a fierce battle with Pratt & Whitney to supply engines for new Airbus medium-haul jets.

CFM exclusively supplies engines for the competing Boeing 737 aircraft, which Qatar Airways has also ordered.

Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker acknowledged Qatar Airways had received attractive prices when it originally ordered the new Pratt & Whitney engine, but said a decision on whether to keep those or switch to CFM for the upgraded A321neo order would depend on other guarantees.

"It is a factor, but what we decide will be based on what sort of guarantees we get on deliveries and at the same time performance," he told Reuters in an interview.

Qatar plans to take delivery of around 10 Airbus A350s and 6 Boeing 777s this year. It will also receive some Boeing 737s on behalf of Italy's Meridiana, where it hopes to tie up a deal to take a 49-percent stake around the end of the month.

It has told Boeing it is interested in taking earlier delivery of future 777-9 aircraft, because that programme is ahead of schedule, Al Baker added.

Asked if Qatar Airways could take on delivery of aircraft for airlines in which it has stakes, like BA owner IAG and Latam, he said "why not," but added he believed those airlines would take their planes as planned.

He was speaking after opening a 1,000-square-metre business lounge at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport, the airline's third premium lounge abroad after London Heathrow and Dubai.

It is building further lounges in Beirut and Bangkok and is negotiating lounge space in seven other airports, he said.

The expansion comes as Gulf airlines have seen premium yields suffering due to low oil prices and rising capacity.

Qatar Airways, which also plans to launch a new premium cabin at a trade fair in March, is investing an unspecified amount in new product to attract passengers "with the right yield" or average revenues, Al Baker said.

But he suggested fuel surcharges may soon be back on the agenda because of a recent rebound in oil prices.

"(Qatar Airways) had to lower (prices in 2016) because oil prices were going down, but now we are starting to put prices up because oil prices are starting to go up," he said.

"Soon, I think not only Qatar Airways but most of the airlines will re-introduce the fuel surcharges because they budgeted on lower fuel price and prices are now rising rapidly."

Oil prices have risen 20 percent in the last three months.

Al Baker said the airline had not seen traffic to France fall after recent attacks. It plans to serve Nice five times a week from July and announce a similar service to Lyon soon.

It continues to experience double-digit growth in passenger numbers, Al Baker added.

GUIDE TO EU MERGER PROCESS

DEADLINES:

The European Commission has 25 working days after a deal is filed for a first-stage review. It may extend that by 10 working days to 35 working days, to consider either a company's proposed remedies or an EU member state's request to handle the case.

Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90 additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working days.

SIMPLIFIED:

Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved.

Qatar Airways talking to CFM about engines for revised Airbus order - Reuters News

{{20170112T113627.793+0000}}Qatar Airways talking to CFM about engines for revised Airbus orderPARIS, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Qatar Airways is in discussions with French-American engine maker CFM International about supplying engines for a revamped order for Airbus narrow-body jets that it expects to finalise "soon", its chief executive said on Thursday.

The Gulf airline has cancelled four A320neo jets powered by alternative Pratt & Whitney engines and expects to swap the overall aircraft order, which was originally for 50 jets, to larger A321neo aircraft.

Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker acknowledged that his airline had received attractive prices when it originally ordered the new Pratt & Whitney engine, but said a decision on whether to keep those or switch to CFM would depend on delivery and performance guarantees.

"We are still talking to CFM," he told Reuters, speaking after opening a 1,000 square metre business lounge at Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport.

Aircraft and engines are often sold separately. A person involved in the talks said the aircraft deal was "imminent".

Alstom beats GE in dispute over $800 mln train signal contract - Reuters News

{{20170110T210140.800+0000}}Alstom beats GE in dispute over $800 mln train signal contractBy Jonathan Stempel

NEW YORK, Jan 10 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday said Alstom SA may ask an independent accounting firm to resolve a dispute over the French company's $800 million purchase of General Electric Co's train-signaling business, and rejected GE's bid for arbitration.

U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan said the "plain language" of the November 2014 sales contract justified letting Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu handle the matter first, rather than arbitrators from the International Chamber of Commerce.

Furman nonetheless said his decision was not a "back door" through which Deloitte could resolve non-accounting matters.

He said that while GE conceded that Deloitte should decide some issues, it remained free to argue that other issues should be arbitrated.

Alstom had sued GE last May, accusing the Boston-based conglomerate of breach of contract for refusing to let Deloitte decide whether the purchase price should be adjusted up or down to account for working capital and net debt.

A GE spokeswoman had no immediate comment.

In court papers GE had accused Alstom of avoiding arbitration in an attempt to "second-guess" its business decisions, and obtain an "after-the-fact discount."

The train-signaling transaction closed in November 2015, on the same day that GE bought Alstom's energy business for an adjusted 9.7 billion euros ($10.2 billion).

GE has been repositioning itself around industrial units such as energy and aviation, while turning away from other businesses including finance and home appliances.

The case is Alstom et al v. General Electric Co, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-03568. (1 euro = US$1.055)

UPDATE 1-Qatar Airways CEO says swapping Airbus A320neo order for A321neos - Reuters News

{{20170105T124000.074+0000}}UPDATE 1-Qatar Airways CEO says swapping Airbus A320neo order for A321neos(Adds context, quotes)

By Tom Finn

DOHA, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Qatar Airways is to swap its order for up to 80 Airbus A320neos for the larger, longer-range A321 version, the airline's chief executive said on Thursday.

The Doha-based carrier has refused to take delivery of A320neos since December 2015 over performance issues with the aircraft's engines. [nL5N1E71MK]

"We are going to take all A321s, there will be no more A320s," Chief Executive Akbar al-Baker told reporters in Doha.

An Airbus spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.

The airline is also deciding whether to switch the engine order for the narrow-body jets from Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp , to CFM, a joint venture between General Electric Co and Safran SA of France.

"We are still negotiating," al-Baker said.

Qatar Airways has refused to accept A320neos powered by Pratt & Whitney engines because they require additional time to start under certain conditions.

The airline said in May it was cutting frequencies on more than a dozen routes from its Doha hub because of delays in acquiring new aircraft from Airbus.

Airbus successfully completed its first test flight for the A321neo in February 2016. However, in December it delayed delivery of its first A321neo to Hawaiian Holdings Inc by three months. [nL2N15O1JL] [nL1N1EF1PL]

Airbus's delivery schedule saw delays through 2016, in part because of problems with engine and cabin parts suppliers.

Al-Baker has said he wants the A321neos from 2018.

Qatar Airways is also moving closer to taking a 49 percent stake in Italy's Meridiana, which it originally planned to finalise in October 2016. [nL8N1A03ED]

"By the end of the month we should have put all the loose ends together," al-Baker said without providing further details.

UPDATE 3-Boeing wins $8.8 bln in 737 MAX orders, still short of goal - Reuters News

{{20170104T214206.627+0000}}UPDATE 3-Boeing wins $8.8 bln in 737 MAX orders, still short of goal(Adds five more orders from Czech Travel Service)

By Alwyn Scott

SEATTLE, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Wednesday it had booked firm orders for 80 of its 737 MAX 8 aircraft, valued at $8.8 billion at list prices, upping its 2016 tally but leaving it short of its goal.

The orders mean the world's biggest plane maker clinched at least 536 net jetliner sales last year compared with its target of selling as many commercial jets as it delivers, a total it puts between 745 and 750. Through November, Boeing had delivered 681 planes.

Boeing's order tally could climb again on Friday, as the company posts its final update for 2016.

Investors watch orders closely as a way to gauge future production and revenue, since Boeing earns the bulk of its money when aircraft are delivered.

The company has orders equivalent to about seven years of production, but the majority are single-aisle 737 planes, and sales of its more expensive widebodies like the 777 remain sluggish.

Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg affirmed the company's overall order target in July. In December, he said Boeing would cut 777 output by 40 percent this year due to slow sales of widebody planes. [nL1N1E71NX]

The orders announced Wednesday include 75 Boeing 737 MAX 8s for General Electric Co Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), valued at $8.25 billion at list prices.

GE supplies engines for the 737 MAX through CFM International, a joint venture with Safran SA of France. The latest sale means GECAS now has 170 Boeing 737 MAXs on order, more than any other leasing company, Boeing said.

The remaining orders, valued at $550 million, came from Travel Service, the largest airline company in the Czech Republic, which operates as SmartWings, Boeing said.

Through December 20, Boeing booked 470 net orders in 2016. Since then, it has announced orders for four 737-800s by Jet2.com. On Dec. 27, Delta Air Lines said it was cancelling an order for 18 Boeing 787 Dreamliners. Northwest Airlines placed the order before it merged with Delta. [nL4N1EM3S4]

Tallying the changes, Boeing's book-to-bill ratio is 0.79, below the target of 1.0.

A Boeing spokesman declined to comment, citing a quiet period before fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 25.

Boeing has received over 3,400 orders for the 737 MAX. The first 737 MAX is expected to be delivered in the first half of 2017.

Boeing's shares were up about 1 percent at $158.46. Up to Tuesday's close, the stock had risen 11.7 percent in the past 12 months, compared with a 12.2 percent rise in the S&P 500 index <.SPX>.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Climate change will unclog water's pipes - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20170104T150709.206+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Climate change will unclog water's pipes(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Antony Currie

NEW YORK, Jan 4 (Reuters Breakingviews) - General Electric picked the wrong time to quit the water business. The H2O sector has been growing slower than hoped despite the rising threat to safe and reliable supplies from drought, flooding, and population growth. But battling climate change will unclog the $1 trillion water industry's pipes in 2017.

GE's water struggles are instructive. Chief Executive Jeff Immelt, who took the conglomerate into the sector by spending more than $4 billion on acquisitions over a decade ago, expected revenue to hit $10 billion a year by now. It's only around a fifth of that, GE revealed on Dec. 14, with up to $300 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

It's a broader industry problem. Water industry revenue has been growing around 5 percent a year – not terrible, but hardly splashy. So Immelt decided in October to sell the division as part of the merger of its parent unit GE Power with oil-services group Baker Hughes . If the unit fetches the same 10.7 times EBITDA that rival Xylem paid for water-meter manufacturer Sensus in August, the $3.2 billion of proceeds will be less than GE paid to build the business.

Immelt's earlier optimism was hardly unusual. Global water demand is likely to increase by 55 percent by the middle of the century, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, as the planet's population swells, the United Nations predicts, by a third to 9.9 billion.

Traditionally, such far-sighted forecasting has been of little use to companies, politicians and investors, though. They tend to base decisions on shorter time frames. But that's slowly changing. Long droughts in California, India, parts of Brazil, swaths of Africa and elsewhere have focused attention on scarcity. And dire predictions are looming closer: three-fifths of the world's inhabitants may face water shortages within the next decade.

Rickety water infrastructure in the western world also needs repairing or replacing. The UK loses nearly a third of its water to leaky pipes. In the United States, a lead-poisoning scandal in Flint, Michigan, has exposed the cost of decades of underinvestment in water infrastructure.

The money spigot is slowly opening. Investment by U.S water authorities is expected to jump by $116 billion over the next decade, a 28 percent increase over the previous 10 years, according to Bluefield Research. Overall, the country's water infrastructure needs $685 billion of investment over the next two decades, reckons the Environmental Protection Agency.

Worldwide, up to $20 trillion of new spending could be needed by 2030, the OECD estimates. China alone has set aside $1.5 trillion to address both inadequate systems and wholesale pollution of its groundwater.

Companies may also start spending more as water risks have moved from a fringe concern to a boardroom issue in recent years. Few firms have yet to develop a comprehensive water policy, though, according to CDP, a nonprofit that runs environmental-disclosure programs for institutional investors. Such a plan takes into account not just their own operations and their suppliers, but the concerns and needs of other water users where they operate.

The Paris climate accord, which took effect in November, could be the extra jolt the sector needs. While water isn't directly mentioned in the pact, an analysis of corporate climate pledges by CDP found that a quarter of plans to cut greenhouse-gas emissions required a stable supply of good quality water. It takes a lot of energy to move water around, so reducing waste can also cut emissions directly.

Sometimes, the reduction can be huge. Energy use is so inefficient at wastewater plants that carbon dioxide emissions could be halved using current technology, according to Xylem. In most cases, operators would even save enough on energy bills to quickly cover the cost of the upgrade.

And as water becomes scarcer around the world, the need to reuse it will rise. Currently, Israel is the leader, reusing 70 percent of its wastewater. In North America, the figure is less than 4 percent, while in low-income countries only 8 percent of wastewater is even treated, let alone reused.

That all suggests the time of the great water-revenue deluge is approaching. GE might soon be inundated with seller's remorse.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Gina McCarthy, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, on Dec. 6 said $685 billion needs to be invested in the country's water infrastructure over the next 20 years.

- Water risks for all companies are growing rapidly, according to the annual Global Water Report published by nonprofit climate-disclosure firm CDP on Nov. 15. The report also outlined how businesses are in general not moving quickly enough to manage water sustainably - but also that those that have are often able to dramatically reduce their carbon emissions.

- General Electric is in talks to sell GE Water. The conglomerate put the unit on the block when it announced it was merging its power business with Baker Hughes on Oct. 31. GE Water earns between $250 million and $300 million a year before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to the company. Based on multiples paid in previous deals, the division could be worth up to $3.3 billion.
