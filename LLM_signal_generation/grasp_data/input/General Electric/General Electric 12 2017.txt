UPDATE 1-U.S. oil rig count ends 2017 40 pct above year-ago levels -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20171229T201130.963+0000}}UPDATE 1-U.S. oil rig count ends 2017 40 pct above year-ago levels -Baker HughesDec 29 (Reuters)

(Adds details, background)

Dec 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. oil rig count rose by about 42 percent by end-2017 compared to the corresponding period last year, as energy companies boosted spending amid a recovery in crude prices.

Drillers held the number of oil rigs steady for a second straight week at 747 in the week to Dec. 29. That was 222 more than the 525 rigs at the end of 2016, General Electric Co's Baker Hughes Inc energy services firm said on Friday.

The oil rig count, an early indicator of future output, remained unchanged in December after rising by 10 in November. It declined by 3 in the fourth quarter after falling by 6 in the third quarter.

U.S. oil prices closed above $60 a barrel for the first time since mid-2015 on the final trading day of the year, ending 2017 with a 12 percent gain spurred by strong demand and declining global inventories. [O/R]

Oil prices had been boosted by signs the global crude glut that has dogged the market since 2014 is shrinking, as a year of production cuts led by Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia helped tighten the market.

OPEC cuts kicked off last January and are scheduled to continue throughout 2018.

In 2017, U.S. crude futures have averaged about $51 a barrel, easily topping last year's $43.47 average.

Looking ahead, futures were trading at about $59 for the balance of 2018 and $56 for calendar 2019 .

In anticipation of higher prices in coming years, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said 21 of the roughly 65 E&Ps they track have already provided capital expenditure guidance for 2018 indicating a 13 percent increase in planned spending over 2017.

Cowen, which has its own U.S. rig count, said it expects a gradual decline in the count in 2018.

There were 929 oil and natural gas rigs active on Dec. 29, up 41 percent from the 658 at the end of 2016.

The average number of rigs in service in 2017 was 876. That compares with 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. Most rigs produce both oil and gas.

U.S. crude oil production in October hit the highest in more than 46 years, rising by 167,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.64 million bpd, U.S. Energy Information Administration's monthly production report on Friday. [nL1N1OT0SZ]

If the figure is not revised next month, it would be the highest monthly level since May 1971.

INSIGHT-In Pakistan, questions raised over GE's flagship power turbines - Reuters News

{{20171228T065949.858+0000}}INSIGHT-In Pakistan, questions raised over GE's flagship power turbinesISLAMABAD/SINGAPORE, Dec 28 (Reuters)

* Pakistan ordered record-setting GE turbines to ease shortfall

* Three newly built power stations beset by delays, outages

* Power station in France also had outages

* GE says technical issues due to normal 'teething' problems

* GE shares fall to lowest level since 2011

(Updates with GE share price, analyst comment)

By Drazen Jorgic and Henning Gloystein

ISLAMABAD/SINGAPORE, Dec 28 (Reuters) - General Electric's flagship gas turbines ran into problems in Pakistan earlier this year, leading to delays and lengthy outages at three newly built power stations, according to several senior Pakistani officials and power executives.

GE has said they were teething problems. But the questions over one of its most important products suggest another setback for the company in a year in which its shares have plunged and third-quarter results were called "horrible" by new Chief Executive John Flannery. GE is now undergoing major restructuring.[nL1N1NC1OM]

There is no evidence that GE's 9HA-Class turbines have fundamental design flaws.

But so far the Pakistani plants, which began running this year, are producing power at levels well below their capacity and the problem was acute in the crucial summer months, when temperatures in the country frequently exceed 40 degrees Celsius (104°F).

Data from Pakistan's Central Power Purchasing Agency, seen by Reuters, showed the Bhikki, Haveli and Balloki plants jointly generated only a half of their current maximum capacity in August.

A month later all three plants showed improved output but remained well below capacity. Reuters was unable to review more recent data.

"It had terrible consequences because we lost a lot of power which would have come to the grid during the peak summer," Yousaf Naseem Khokhar, the top civil servant in the Energy Ministry's power division, told Reuters.

"It is now up to General Electric to rise to the challenge and to take care of these issues... before next summer starts," he said.

In a statement sent to Reuters, GE said "every commercial HA site today is demonstrating exceptional performance levels for both output and efficiency".

On the issues in Pakistan, GE said: "We've encountered and communicated openly about launch challenges and readily resolved issues during this time. It's important to note that challenges are common with power plants of this size and complexity during the commissioning and early operations phase."

GE also said in a separate statement that the three plants are expected to deliver enough power to supply the equivalent of 7.3 million Pakistani homes over their 30-plus-year life cycle, and that will make a "meaningful difference in the everyday lives of the people of Pakistan."

Due to its large and fast-growing population and economy and well developed gas infrastructure, Pakistan is seen as a key growth market for power turbine makers, with all major turbine makers actively looking for business.

"Pakistan is seen as one of the fastest growing markets ... and there has been a plethora of contracting activity from Pakistan over the last couple years," said Saul Kavonic of energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Pakistan still needed "additional investment in energy infrastructure," he added.

The 9HA-class gas turbines, the GE power division's newest and most prestigious product, entered the Guinness World Records last year for efficiency, based on the amount of electricity generated from natural gas at the power plant in Bouchain, France, where it was first put into commercial operation in June last year.

Both the 9HA and the 7HA turbines - the A stands for air-cooled - are in tough competition with similar products made by Germany's Siemens , Japan's Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems - a joint venture between Mitsubishi Heavy Industries <7011.T> and Hitachi <6501.T> - and Italy's state-controlled Ansaldo Energia.

Flannery said in a GE investor presentation in November that "resolving initial launch issues" with HA class gas turbines would be a future priority.

TOUGH YEAR

GE's shares have fallen 45 percent this year, hitting $17.31 on Wednesday, their lowest level since December 2011.

The 125-year-old company announced this month it was cutting 12,000 jobs in its power division, about a fifth of the workforce, to cut costs. [nL1N1O713Q]

Operating profit of the power division, once the strongest part of GE's operations, fell 51 percent in the third quarter against the year-ago period. Flannery said the division, which brought in 28 percent of GE's revenue last year, was "challenged" but could be turned around in one or two years.

Pakistan, desperate for additional electricity to avoid crippling blackouts, teamed up with GE to build the power stations at Bhikki, Haveli and Balloki, all in the most populous province Punjab, at breakneck speed.

GE won the contracts to supply Pakistan with six turbines for the three power plants in 2015, based on the lowest priced deal per megawatt of capacity.

The first problem was the deliveries were delayed by up to three months and missed some of the summer months this year, several Pakistani officials said. They said they were told the delays happened because a part of the turbine needed further testing.

The plan was to fire up the turbines in simple cycle mode - delivering around 800 MW per power plant - in the spring of 2017 and then to upgrade to 1,200 MW combined cycle output after the summer.

The delays infuriated Islamabad, because getting additional power during the summer was a crucial factor ahead of 2018 parliamentary elections.

One of the two turbines at the Bhikki power plant was delayed by about a month. At the Balloki and Haveli plants, the turbines were delayed by about three months, two senior Pakistani officials aware of the situation said.

Then, in early May, a combustion seal leak was detected at one of the turbines at the Bhikki plant.

To fix this, and to apply the same remedy to the five other turbines, GE airlifted parts of the units to France for repairs.

Pakistan's Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, who was then the petroleum minister, told Reuters in July that GE spared no expense to fix the problems.

"They found the problem, they took out the part, they went back to the vendor, they re-machined them, they came back – all on dedicated transport flights," Abbasi said.

TURBINE DAMAGE

But that meant one Bhikki turbine was offline for about 40 days and the other for about 50 days. The other two plants had not begun operations at the time, but came online in July and August.

In a third setback, one of the turbines at the Haveli plant was badly damaged during a power outage three weeks after it was inaugurated in July, the Pakistani officials said.

At such times, batteries and a generator act as back-ups to ensure a pump continues to push lube oil into the turbine.

"Both didn't work," said one of the Pakistani officials, adding the diesel generator had no fuel. The turbine crashed, with damage estimated at $33 million, and although it was refitted with a new rotor by GE, it is still to resume operations.

The power station is being built by China's SEPCOIII Electric Power Construction Corporation. SEPCOIII did not return queries for comment.

"GE and SEPCOIII are working together to determine the cause behind the loss of functionality of the planned backup power system," GE said in a statement.

A senior Pakistani official in Islamabad said the delays and outages had cast GE in a bad light.

"Frankly speaking, they have lost a lot of credibility here in the government because of these plants," the official said.

In September, Pakistan awarded its most recent power contract to Siemens, after bidding by several companies, including GE.

Stephen Tusa, an analyst at JPMorgan in New York, wrote in a recent note that although GE has assured investors that the Pakistan problems have been resolved, they could re-emerge in other plants around the world.

"The risk is that if these issues are not remedied, GE has already 'sold' another around 30 units (around 10 plus of which are in operation), some of which are at higher output ratings," he wrote.

"Remedies would have to be applied up the curve, something we view as a challenge, especially as senior management tries to cut costs aggressively. Stay tuned."

FORCED OUTAGES

Not everyone is complaining, even when performance isn't perfect.

In France, the Bouchain plant suffered 26 forced outages in the 15 months ending November, according to data published by operator Electricite de France (EDF) .

Despite these unplanned outages, GE and operator EDF, with whom GE has a long-standing alliance, say they are satisfied.

"The cause of these events varies, and in certain cases a single event has been interpreted as multiple events. It would not be accurate to link this number to HA technology as fewer than 10 of these events were related to the gas turbine," GE and EDF said in a joint statement.

In a another joint statement, the two said "the Bouchain facility is an example of our HA technology at its very best".

They added: "During the commissioning and early operations phase, we encountered minor issues that are very typical of what you'd expect with a project of this size, but we worked together to quickly resolve them."

GE to keep Rochester plant open - Reuters News

{{20171228T015918.236+0000}}GE to keep Rochester plant openDec 27 (Reuters)

Dec 27 (Reuters) - U.S. industrial conglomerate General Electric Co said on Wednesday it would keep its plant running in Rochester, New York, retaining all employees at the facility for now.

Boston-based GE in August was reportedly planning to close the plant by June 2018, and move the work to China. The plant, part of GE's troubled power business, assembles electronic boards and employs about 100 people.

As part of an "exhaustive review" of GE Power's operations "we have determined that, at this time, we are best able to serve our customers by keeping manufacturing and assembly operations for our industrial communications product line in Rochester," GE said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.

GE added that it was not offered any incentives by the state government to stay in Rochester.

Earlier this month, GE said it would axe 12,000 jobs at its power business, which sells electrical generation equipment. [nL1N1O713Q]

GE launched the cuts to save $1 billion in 2018 at the power unit, as it expects dwindling demand for fossil-fuel power plants to continue.

Nordex and Siemens-Gamesa vie for major Brazilian wind farm contracts - 路透新闻

{{20171227T194724.613+0000}}Nordex and Siemens-Gamesa vie for major Brazilian wind farm contractsSAO PAULO, Dec 27 (Reuters)

By Luciano Costa

SAO PAULO, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Wind turbine makers Nordex SE and Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy SA are vying for contracts with companies that won major auctions last week to build new wind farms in Brazil, two people with knowledge of the matter said.

Projects whose licenses were auctioned last week total 1.5 gigawatt in capacity and will require 8.5 billion reais ($2.6 billion) to be built, according to industry data.

According to the sources, Nordex , which absorbed Acciona's wind power business last year, is in talks with Italy's Enel Green Power SpA to supply turbines to projects that total 630 megawatts in capacity. Siemens-Gamesa may supply turbines to projects won by France's Voltalia SA , Enel SpA , Portugal's EDP Renovaveis SA and Brazil's Neoenergia SA , added the people.

The sources, who spoke on Tuesday and Wednesday, asked for anonymity because negotiations are private.

General Electric Co is vying for a contract to supply Brazilian generation company Omega Geração SA . A joint venture between European Energy AS and Eólica Tecnologia may buy equipment from Denmark's Vestas Wind Systems AS , the sources added.

Nordex-Acciona, Siemens-Gamesa and GE did not reply to requests for comment. Enel, Omega, Voltalia, EDP and Neoenergia declined to comment. Vestas said it does not usually disclose contracts under negotiation. Eólica Tecnologia said is considering importing machines to build the wind farms, without elaborating. ($1 = 3.31 reais)

UPDATE 1-U.S. oil rig count ends 2017 40 pct above year-ago levels -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20171229T201130.963+0000}}UPDATE 1-U.S. oil rig count ends 2017 40 pct above year-ago levels -Baker HughesDec 29 (Reuters)

(Adds details, background)

Dec 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. oil rig count rose by about 42 percent by end-2017 compared to the corresponding period last year, as energy companies boosted spending amid a recovery in crude prices.

Drillers held the number of oil rigs steady for a second straight week at 747 in the week to Dec. 29. That was 222 more than the 525 rigs at the end of 2016, General Electric Co's Baker Hughes Inc energy services firm said on Friday.

The oil rig count, an early indicator of future output, remained unchanged in December after rising by 10 in November. It declined by 3 in the fourth quarter after falling by 6 in the third quarter.

U.S. oil prices closed above $60 a barrel for the first time since mid-2015 on the final trading day of the year, ending 2017 with a 12 percent gain spurred by strong demand and declining global inventories. [O/R]

Oil prices had been boosted by signs the global crude glut that has dogged the market since 2014 is shrinking, as a year of production cuts led by Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia helped tighten the market.

OPEC cuts kicked off last January and are scheduled to continue throughout 2018.

In 2017, U.S. crude futures have averaged about $51 a barrel, easily topping last year's $43.47 average.

Looking ahead, futures were trading at about $59 for the balance of 2018 and $56 for calendar 2019 .

In anticipation of higher prices in coming years, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said 21 of the roughly 65 E&Ps they track have already provided capital expenditure guidance for 2018 indicating a 13 percent increase in planned spending over 2017.

Cowen, which has its own U.S. rig count, said it expects a gradual decline in the count in 2018.

There were 929 oil and natural gas rigs active on Dec. 29, up 41 percent from the 658 at the end of 2016.

The average number of rigs in service in 2017 was 876. That compares with 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. Most rigs produce both oil and gas.

U.S. crude oil production in October hit the highest in more than 46 years, rising by 167,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.64 million bpd, U.S. Energy Information Administration's monthly production report on Friday. [nL1N1OT0SZ]

If the figure is not revised next month, it would be the highest monthly level since May 1971.

INSIGHT-In Pakistan, questions raised over GE's flagship power turbines - Reuters News

{{20171228T065949.858+0000}}INSIGHT-In Pakistan, questions raised over GE's flagship power turbinesISLAMABAD/SINGAPORE, Dec 28 (Reuters)

* Pakistan ordered record-setting GE turbines to ease shortfall

* Three newly built power stations beset by delays, outages

* Power station in France also had outages

* GE says technical issues due to normal 'teething' problems

* GE shares fall to lowest level since 2011

(Updates with GE share price, analyst comment)

By Drazen Jorgic and Henning Gloystein

ISLAMABAD/SINGAPORE, Dec 28 (Reuters) - General Electric's flagship gas turbines ran into problems in Pakistan earlier this year, leading to delays and lengthy outages at three newly built power stations, according to several senior Pakistani officials and power executives.

GE has said they were teething problems. But the questions over one of its most important products suggest another setback for the company in a year in which its shares have plunged and third-quarter results were called "horrible" by new Chief Executive John Flannery. GE is now undergoing major restructuring.[nL1N1NC1OM]

There is no evidence that GE's 9HA-Class turbines have fundamental design flaws.

But so far the Pakistani plants, which began running this year, are producing power at levels well below their capacity and the problem was acute in the crucial summer months, when temperatures in the country frequently exceed 40 degrees Celsius (104°F).

Data from Pakistan's Central Power Purchasing Agency, seen by Reuters, showed the Bhikki, Haveli and Balloki plants jointly generated only a half of their current maximum capacity in August.

A month later all three plants showed improved output but remained well below capacity. Reuters was unable to review more recent data.

"It had terrible consequences because we lost a lot of power which would have come to the grid during the peak summer," Yousaf Naseem Khokhar, the top civil servant in the Energy Ministry's power division, told Reuters.

"It is now up to General Electric to rise to the challenge and to take care of these issues... before next summer starts," he said.

In a statement sent to Reuters, GE said "every commercial HA site today is demonstrating exceptional performance levels for both output and efficiency".

On the issues in Pakistan, GE said: "We've encountered and communicated openly about launch challenges and readily resolved issues during this time. It's important to note that challenges are common with power plants of this size and complexity during the commissioning and early operations phase."

GE also said in a separate statement that the three plants are expected to deliver enough power to supply the equivalent of 7.3 million Pakistani homes over their 30-plus-year life cycle, and that will make a "meaningful difference in the everyday lives of the people of Pakistan."

Due to its large and fast-growing population and economy and well developed gas infrastructure, Pakistan is seen as a key growth market for power turbine makers, with all major turbine makers actively looking for business.

"Pakistan is seen as one of the fastest growing markets ... and there has been a plethora of contracting activity from Pakistan over the last couple years," said Saul Kavonic of energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Pakistan still needed "additional investment in energy infrastructure," he added.

The 9HA-class gas turbines, the GE power division's newest and most prestigious product, entered the Guinness World Records last year for efficiency, based on the amount of electricity generated from natural gas at the power plant in Bouchain, France, where it was first put into commercial operation in June last year.

Both the 9HA and the 7HA turbines - the A stands for air-cooled - are in tough competition with similar products made by Germany's Siemens , Japan's Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems - a joint venture between Mitsubishi Heavy Industries <7011.T> and Hitachi <6501.T> - and Italy's state-controlled Ansaldo Energia.

Flannery said in a GE investor presentation in November that "resolving initial launch issues" with HA class gas turbines would be a future priority.

TOUGH YEAR

GE's shares have fallen 45 percent this year, hitting $17.31 on Wednesday, their lowest level since December 2011.

The 125-year-old company announced this month it was cutting 12,000 jobs in its power division, about a fifth of the workforce, to cut costs. [nL1N1O713Q]

Operating profit of the power division, once the strongest part of GE's operations, fell 51 percent in the third quarter against the year-ago period. Flannery said the division, which brought in 28 percent of GE's revenue last year, was "challenged" but could be turned around in one or two years.

Pakistan, desperate for additional electricity to avoid crippling blackouts, teamed up with GE to build the power stations at Bhikki, Haveli and Balloki, all in the most populous province Punjab, at breakneck speed.

GE won the contracts to supply Pakistan with six turbines for the three power plants in 2015, based on the lowest priced deal per megawatt of capacity.

The first problem was the deliveries were delayed by up to three months and missed some of the summer months this year, several Pakistani officials said. They said they were told the delays happened because a part of the turbine needed further testing.

The plan was to fire up the turbines in simple cycle mode - delivering around 800 MW per power plant - in the spring of 2017 and then to upgrade to 1,200 MW combined cycle output after the summer.

The delays infuriated Islamabad, because getting additional power during the summer was a crucial factor ahead of 2018 parliamentary elections.

One of the two turbines at the Bhikki power plant was delayed by about a month. At the Balloki and Haveli plants, the turbines were delayed by about three months, two senior Pakistani officials aware of the situation said.

Then, in early May, a combustion seal leak was detected at one of the turbines at the Bhikki plant.

To fix this, and to apply the same remedy to the five other turbines, GE airlifted parts of the units to France for repairs.

Pakistan's Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, who was then the petroleum minister, told Reuters in July that GE spared no expense to fix the problems.

"They found the problem, they took out the part, they went back to the vendor, they re-machined them, they came back – all on dedicated transport flights," Abbasi said.

TURBINE DAMAGE

But that meant one Bhikki turbine was offline for about 40 days and the other for about 50 days. The other two plants had not begun operations at the time, but came online in July and August.

In a third setback, one of the turbines at the Haveli plant was badly damaged during a power outage three weeks after it was inaugurated in July, the Pakistani officials said.

At such times, batteries and a generator act as back-ups to ensure a pump continues to push lube oil into the turbine.

"Both didn't work," said one of the Pakistani officials, adding the diesel generator had no fuel. The turbine crashed, with damage estimated at $33 million, and although it was refitted with a new rotor by GE, it is still to resume operations.

The power station is being built by China's SEPCOIII Electric Power Construction Corporation. SEPCOIII did not return queries for comment.

"GE and SEPCOIII are working together to determine the cause behind the loss of functionality of the planned backup power system," GE said in a statement.

A senior Pakistani official in Islamabad said the delays and outages had cast GE in a bad light.

"Frankly speaking, they have lost a lot of credibility here in the government because of these plants," the official said.

In September, Pakistan awarded its most recent power contract to Siemens, after bidding by several companies, including GE.

Stephen Tusa, an analyst at JPMorgan in New York, wrote in a recent note that although GE has assured investors that the Pakistan problems have been resolved, they could re-emerge in other plants around the world.

"The risk is that if these issues are not remedied, GE has already 'sold' another around 30 units (around 10 plus of which are in operation), some of which are at higher output ratings," he wrote.

"Remedies would have to be applied up the curve, something we view as a challenge, especially as senior management tries to cut costs aggressively. Stay tuned."

FORCED OUTAGES

Not everyone is complaining, even when performance isn't perfect.

In France, the Bouchain plant suffered 26 forced outages in the 15 months ending November, according to data published by operator Electricite de France (EDF) .

Despite these unplanned outages, GE and operator EDF, with whom GE has a long-standing alliance, say they are satisfied.

"The cause of these events varies, and in certain cases a single event has been interpreted as multiple events. It would not be accurate to link this number to HA technology as fewer than 10 of these events were related to the gas turbine," GE and EDF said in a joint statement.

In a another joint statement, the two said "the Bouchain facility is an example of our HA technology at its very best".

They added: "During the commissioning and early operations phase, we encountered minor issues that are very typical of what you'd expect with a project of this size, but we worked together to quickly resolve them."

GE to keep Rochester plant open - Reuters News

{{20171228T015918.236+0000}}GE to keep Rochester plant openDec 27 (Reuters)

Dec 27 (Reuters) - U.S. industrial conglomerate General Electric Co said on Wednesday it would keep its plant running in Rochester, New York, retaining all employees at the facility for now.

Boston-based GE in August was reportedly planning to close the plant by June 2018, and move the work to China. The plant, part of GE's troubled power business, assembles electronic boards and employs about 100 people.

As part of an "exhaustive review" of GE Power's operations "we have determined that, at this time, we are best able to serve our customers by keeping manufacturing and assembly operations for our industrial communications product line in Rochester," GE said in an emailed statement on Wednesday.

GE added that it was not offered any incentives by the state government to stay in Rochester.

Earlier this month, GE said it would axe 12,000 jobs at its power business, which sells electrical generation equipment. [nL1N1O713Q]

GE launched the cuts to save $1 billion in 2018 at the power unit, as it expects dwindling demand for fossil-fuel power plants to continue.

Nordex and Siemens-Gamesa vie for major Brazilian wind farm contracts - 路透新闻

{{20171227T194724.613+0000}}Nordex and Siemens-Gamesa vie for major Brazilian wind farm contractsSAO PAULO, Dec 27 (Reuters)

By Luciano Costa

SAO PAULO, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Wind turbine makers Nordex SE and Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy SA are vying for contracts with companies that won major auctions last week to build new wind farms in Brazil, two people with knowledge of the matter said.

Projects whose licenses were auctioned last week total 1.5 gigawatt in capacity and will require 8.5 billion reais ($2.6 billion) to be built, according to industry data.

According to the sources, Nordex , which absorbed Acciona's wind power business last year, is in talks with Italy's Enel Green Power SpA to supply turbines to projects that total 630 megawatts in capacity. Siemens-Gamesa may supply turbines to projects won by France's Voltalia SA , Enel SpA , Portugal's EDP Renovaveis SA and Brazil's Neoenergia SA , added the people.

The sources, who spoke on Tuesday and Wednesday, asked for anonymity because negotiations are private.

General Electric Co is vying for a contract to supply Brazilian generation company Omega Geração SA . A joint venture between European Energy AS and Eólica Tecnologia may buy equipment from Denmark's Vestas Wind Systems AS , the sources added.

Nordex-Acciona, Siemens-Gamesa and GE did not reply to requests for comment. Enel, Omega, Voltalia, EDP and Neoenergia declined to comment. Vestas said it does not usually disclose contracts under negotiation. Eólica Tecnologia said is considering importing machines to build the wind farms, without elaborating. ($1 = 3.31 reais)

BREAKINGVIEWS-GE exits 3D-printing fight only slightly bruised - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20171227T181924.000+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-GE exits 3D-printing fight only slightly bruisedNEW YORK, Dec 27 (Reuters Breakingviews)

(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Tom Buerkle

NEW YORK, Dec 27 (Reuters Breakingviews) - John Flannery risks gaining a reputation as a pushover for activists. Two months after giving a board seat to Nelson Peltz's Trian Partners, the General Electric chief executive ended a 15-month tussle for ownership of Sweden's Arcam by buying hedge fund Elliott Management's stake at a modest premium. GE should benefit from having full control of a technology critical to its aviation business, even if it nets Elliott's Paul Singer a handsome profit.

In September 2016, the U.S. conglomerate made offers worth a combined $1.4 billion for Arcam and Germany's SLM Solutions . Both companies make equipment for additive manufacturing, the technical name for 3D printing, on which GE increasingly relies. Elliott claimed they were low-ball bids and quickly snapped up an effective blocking stake of 20 percent of SLM and a smaller holding in Arcam.

GE walked away from the German deal, causing SLM's stock to plunge by more than 20 percent in October 2016, but it bumped up its Arcam bid and succeeded in acquiring a roughly 75 percent stake. It also bought a private German 3D-printing outfit, Concept Laser.

Paying up to be shot of Elliott is capitulation, but the justifiable kind. Since taking over from Jeff Immelt in July, the new GE boss has promised a radical rethink at GE to shore up profits and stem a share-price tumble that has wiped away more than $100 billion of market value in the past year. But the aviation business is the closest thing he has to a sacred cow, and 3D printing is integral to its future – from producing fuel nozzles on the engines it produces for the Boeing 737, to potentially making one-third of the parts for a new turboprop engine it's developing. GE thinks the technology can help it save $5 billion in costs over a decade.

The total $720 million bill for Arcan's stock is a speck for the $151 billion GE. But it's a decent win for Elliott and fellow activist Polygon, who have secured a price about 25 percent higher than when they acquired their stakes. Even SLM's shares have recovered to put Singer in the black. Flannery, meanwhile, has again shown willingness to negotiate with activists. As precedents go, that's both commendable and risky.

CONTEXT NEWS

- General Electric said on Dec. 27 it had agreed to acquire minority stakes in Arcam from activist hedge funds Elliott Management and Polygon Investment, leaving it with roughly 95 percent of the Swedish 3D-printing company from 77 percent previously.

- GE said it would acquire the remaining shares in a compulsory buyout procedure and delist Arcam's shares from the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange.

- The U.S. industrial group will pay 345 crowns a share, or $41.67, for the stakes held by the two hedge funds. According to Eikon data, Elliott owned an 8.5 percent stake according to its most recent regulatory filing while Tetragon Financial, the owner of Polygon, owned 5.3 percent. Those stakes would be worth $87 million and $54 million, respectively, at the purchase price.

- GE acquired a majority stake in Arcam in November 2016 with an agreed offer of 300 crowns a share.

Airbus ready to axe A380 if fails to win Emirates deal -sources - 路透新闻

* Airbus, Emirates in talks over lifeline A380 deal

* Emirates is top A380 buyer, wants output guarantees

* Loss-making A380 has lost out to new twin-engined jets

By Tim Hepher

PARIS, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Airbus is drawing up contingency plans to phase out production of the world's largest jetliner, the A380 superjumbo, if it fails to win a key order from Dubai's Emirates, three people familiar with the matter said.

The moment of truth for the slow-selling airliner looms after just 10 years in service and leaves one of Europe's most visible international symbols hanging by a thread, despite a major airline investment in new cabins unveiled this month.

"If there is no Emirates deal, Airbus will start the process of ending A380 production," a person briefed on the plans said. A supplier added such a move was logical due to weak demand.

Airbus and Emirates declined to comment. Airbus also declined to say how many people work on the project.

Any shutdown is expected to be gradual, allowing Airbus to produce orders it has in hand, mainly from Emirates.

It has enough orders to last until early next decade at current production rates, according to a Reuters analysis.

The A380 was developed at a cost of 11 billion euros to carry some 500 people and challenge the reign of the Boeing 747.

But demand for these four-engined goliaths has fallen as airlines choose smaller twin-engined models, which are easier to fill and cheaper to maintain.

Emirates, however, has been a strong believer in the A380 and is easily the largest customer with total orders of 142 aircraft, of which it has taken just over 100.

Talks between Airbus and Emirates over a new order for 36 superjumbos worth $16 billion broke down at the Dubai Airshow last month. Negotiations are said to have resumed, but there are no visible signs that a deal is imminent. [nL8N1NI07Z]

Although airlines such as British Airways have expressed interest in the A380, Airbus is reluctant to keep factories open without the certainty that a bulk Emirates order would provide.

Emirates, for its part, wants a guarantee that Airbus will keep production going for a decade to protect its investment.

A decision to cancel would mark a rupture between Airbus and one of its largest customers and tie Emirates' future growth to recent Boeing orders. European sources say that reflects growing American influence in the Gulf under President Donald Trump, but U.S. and UAE industry sources deny politics are involved.

There are also potential hurdles to a deal over engine choices and after-sales support. [nL8N1NN2NC]

SAFETY NET

Yet if talks succeed, European sources say there is a glimmer of hope for the double-deck jet, which Airbus says will become more popular with airlines due to congestion.

Singapore Airlines, which first introduced the A380 to passengers in 2007, showcased an $850 million cabin re-design this month and expressed confidence in the model's future.

Airbus hopes to use an Emirates order to stabilise output and establish a safety net from which to attract A380 sales to other carriers, but has ruled out trying to do this the other way round, industry sources said.

As of the end of November, Airbus had won orders for 317 A380s and delivered 221, leaving 96 unfilled orders.

But based on airlines' intentions or finances, 47 of those are unlikely to be delivered, according to industry sources, which halves the number of jets in play.

Airbus needs to sell at least another 30 to keep lines open for 10 years and possibly more to justify the price concessions likely to be demanded by any new buyers.

To bridge the gap, Airbus plans to cut output to six a year beyond 2019, from 12 in 2018 and 8 in 2019, even if it means producing at a loss, Reuters recently reported. [nL8N1OB4H2]

Chief Operating Officer Fabrice Bregier confirmed this month Airbus was looking at cutting output to 6-7 a year. [nS7N1NM00C]

If Airbus does decide to wind down production, some believe Emirates will ask Airbus to deliver the remaining 41 it has on order and then keep most A380s in service as long as possible.

Even so, some A380s are likely to be heading for scrap.

UPDATE 2-GE raises stake in Sweden's Arcam by buying shares from hedge funds - Reuters News

{{20171227T000533.000+0000}}UPDATE 2-GE raises stake in Sweden's Arcam by buying shares from hedge fundsDec 27 (Reuters)

(Adds Breakingviews, updates share price)

Dec 27 (Reuters) - General Electric Co said on Wednesday it would raise its stake in Swedish 3D printer maker Arcam AB to around 95 percent from 77 percent after buying shares from hedge funds Elliott and Polygon.

GE said it would buy Elliott Management and Polygon Investment Group's outstanding shares for 345 Swedish crowns ($41.44) each.

GE also said it planned to acquire all remaining shares of Arcam in a compulsory buyout procedure and to request that the company delist its shares from the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange. [nBw33cPn3a]

Activist Elliott built a 10 percent stake in Arcam in October 2016 after GE announced an initial tender for the 3D printer maker, which the hedge fund rejected.

GE later offered a 5 percent bump on its first offer, raising it to 300 crowns per share, and Arcam said GE's offer was completed in November 2016. [nL4N1CX35C]

A spokeswoman for Elliott declined to comment while Polygon did not respond to requests for comment.

Arcam shares rose 11 percent to 346.50 Swedish crowns.

3D printing has been used to build prototypes for decades but has become more widespread for industrial mass production in recent years, with uses including the production of dental crowns, medical implants and light aircraft parts.

GE has long been one of the main proponents of industrial 3D printing, using it to make fuel nozzles for its new LEAP jet engine in what marked a big step in using the technology in mass production. ($1 = 8.3276 Swedish crowns)

CORRECTED-INSIGHT-In Pakistan, questions raised over GE's flagship power turbines - Reuters News

{{20171227T000030.000+0000}}CORRECTED-INSIGHT-In Pakistan, questions raised over GE's flagship power turbinesISLAMABAD/SINGAPORE, Dec 27 (Reuters)

(Corrects paragraph 24 to show GE airlifted parts of the turbine units to France, not all of the units)

* Pakistan ordered record-setting GE turbines to ease shortfall

* Three newly built power stations beset by delays, outages

* Power station in France also had outages

* GE says technical issues due to normal 'teething' problems

By Drazen Jorgic and Henning Gloystein

ISLAMABAD/SINGAPORE, Dec 27 (Reuters) - General Electric's flagship gas turbines ran into problems in Pakistan earlier this year, leading to delays and lengthy outages at three newly built power stations, according to several senior Pakistani officials and power executives.

GE has said they were teething problems. But the questions over one of its most important products suggest another setback for the company in a year in which its shares have plunged and third-quarter results were called "horrible" by new Chief Executive John Flannery. GE is now undergoing major restructuring.[nL1N1NC1OM]

There is no evidence that GE's 9HA-Class turbines have fundamental design flaws.

But so far the Pakistani plants, which began running this year, are producing power at levels well below their capacity and the problem was acute in the crucial summer months, when temperatures in the country frequently exceed 40 degrees Celsius (104°F).

Data from Pakistan's Central Power Purchasing Agency, seen by Reuters, showed the Bhikki, Haveli and Balloki plants jointly generated only a half of their current maximum capacity in August.

A month later all three plants showed improved output but remained well below capacity. Reuters was unable to review more recent data.

"It had terrible consequences because we lost a lot of power which would have come to the grid during the peak summer," Yousaf Naseem Khokhar, the top civil servant in the Energy Ministry's power division, told Reuters.

"It is now up to General Electric to rise to the challenge and to take care of these issues... before next summer starts," he said.

In a statement sent to Reuters, GE said "every commercial HA site today is demonstrating exceptional performance levels for both output and efficiency".

On the issues in Pakistan, GE said: "We've encountered and communicated openly about launch challenges and readily resolved issues during this time. It's important to note that challenges are common with power plants of this size and complexity during the commissioning and early operations phase."

GE also said in a separate statement that the three plants are expected to deliver enough power to supply the equivalent of 7.3 million Pakistani homes over their 30-plus-year life cycle, and that will make a "meaningful difference in the everyday lives of the people of Pakistan."

The 9HA-class gas turbines, the GE power division's newest and most prestigious product, entered the Guinness World Records last year for efficiency, based on the amount of electricity generated from natural gas at the power plant in Bouchain, France, where it was first put into commercial operation in June last year.

Both the 9HA and the 7HA turbines - the A stands for air-cooled - are in tough competition with similar products made by Germany's Siemens , Japan's Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems - a joint venture between Mitsubishi Heavy Industries <7011.T> and Hitachi <6501.T> - and Italy's state-controlled Ansaldo Energia.

Flannery said in a GE investor presentation in November that "resolving initial launch issues" with HA class gas turbines would be a future priority.

TOUGH YEAR

GE's shares have fallen more than 40 percent this year, and the 125-year-old company announced this month it was cutting 12,000 jobs in its power division, about a fifth of the workforce, to cut costs. [nL1N1O713Q]

Operating profit of the power division, once the strongest part of GE's operations, fell 51 percent in the third quarter against the year-ago period. Flannery said the division, which brought in 28 percent of GE's revenue last year, was "challenged" but could be turned around in one or two years.

Pakistan, desperate for additional electricity to avoid crippling blackouts, teamed up with GE to build the power stations at Bhikki, Haveli and Balloki, all in the most populous province Punjab, at breakneck speed.

GE won the contracts to supply Pakistan with six turbines for the three power plants in 2015, based on the lowest priced deal per megawatt of capacity.

The first problem was the deliveries were delayed by up to three months and missed some of the summer months this year, several Pakistani officials said. They said they were told the delays happened because a part of the turbine needed further testing.

The plan was to fire up the turbines in simple cycle mode - delivering around 800 MW per power plant - in the spring of 2017 and then to upgrade to 1,200 MW combined cycle output after the summer.

The delays infuriated Islamabad, because getting additional power during the summer was a crucial factor ahead of 2018 parliamentary elections.

One of the two turbines at the Bhikki power plant was delayed by about a month. At the Balloki and Haveli plants, the turbines were delayed by about three months, two senior Pakistani officials aware of the situation said.

Then, in early May, a combustion seal leak was detected at one of the turbines at the Bhikki plant.

To fix this, and to apply the same remedy to the five other turbines, GE airlifted parts of the units to France for repairs.

Pakistan's Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, who was then the petroleum minister, told Reuters in July that GE spared no expense to fix the problems.

"They found the problem, they took out the part, they went back to the vendor, they re-machined them, they came back – all on dedicated transport flights," Abbasi said.

TURBINE DAMAGE

But that meant one Bhikki turbine was offline for about 40 days and the other for about 50 days. The other two plants had not begun operations at the time, but came online in July and August.

In a third setback, one of the turbines at the Haveli plant was badly damaged during a power outage three weeks after it was inaugurated in July, the Pakistani officials said.

At such times, batteries and a generator act as back-ups to ensure a pump continues to push lube oil into the turbine.

"Both didn't work," said one of the Pakistani officials, adding the diesel generator had no fuel. The turbine crashed, with damage estimated at $33 million, and although it was refitted with a new rotor by GE, it is still to resume operations.

The power station is being built by China's SEPCOIII Electric Power Construction Corporation. SEPCOIII did not return queries for comment.

"GE and SEPCOIII are working together to determine the cause behind the loss of functionality of the planned backup power system," GE said in a statement.

A senior Pakistani official in Islamabad said the delays and outages had cast GE in a bad light.

"Frankly speaking, they have lost a lot of credibility here in the government because of these plants," the official said.

In September, Pakistan awarded its most recent power contract to Siemens, after bidding by several companies, including GE.

Stephen Tusa, an analyst at JPMorgan in New York, wrote in a recent note that although GE has assured investors that the Pakistan problems have been resolved, they could re-emerge in other plants around the world.

"The risk is that if these issues are not remedied, GE has already 'sold' another around 30 units (around 10 plus of which are in operation), some of which are at higher output ratings," he wrote.

"Remedies would have to be applied up the curve, something we view as a challenge, especially as senior management tries to cut costs aggressively. Stay tuned."

FORCED OUTAGES

Not everyone is complaining, even when performance isn't perfect.

In France, the Bouchain plant suffered 26 forced outages in the 15 months ending November, according to data published by operator Electricite de France (EDF) .

Despite these unplanned outages, GE and operator EDF, with whom GE has a long-standing alliance, say they are satisfied.

"The cause of these events varies, and in certain cases a single event has been interpreted as multiple events. It would not be accurate to link this number to HA technology as fewer than 10 of these events were related to the gas turbine," GE and EDF said in a joint statement.

In a another joint statement, the two said "the Bouchain facility is an example of our HA technology at its very best".

They added: "During the commissioning and early operations phase, we encountered minor issues that are very typical of what you'd expect with a project of this size, but we worked together to quickly resolve them."

RPT-Wall St Week Ahead-This year's lumps of coal could be 2018's diamonds - 路透新闻

{{20171222T235435.886+0000}}RPT-Wall St Week Ahead-This year's lumps of coal could be 2018's diamondsSAN FRANCISCO, Dec 22 (Reuters)

(Repeats story with no changes)

By Noel Randewich

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Investors saddled in 2017
with the market's worst performers, including Under Armour and
General Electric, may do well to remember as December draws to
an end that lumps of coal sometimes turn into diamonds.

As investment advisors rebalance clients' portfolios in the
final weeks of the year, the instinct to dump stocks that have
been left behind in surging markets - or that fall out of favor
with analysts - can be self-destructive.

With the S&P 500's rally pushing price/earnings multiples to
highs not seen since 2002, laggards overlooked by a rush to own
technology and other high-growth stocks may attract
bargain-hunting investors heading into 2017.

"A contrarian strategy of buying beaten-up names might have
a good year," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of
Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York.

Ghriskey in recent months bought shares of General Electric
, which has slumped 45 percent this year as it struggles
with a shift from coal and gas to renewable energy. He believes
the 125-year-old conglomerate will claw its way back to growth,
or might be split into multiple companies.

Some of the worst-performing stocks of 2016 roared back to
life in 2017, including Vertex Pharmaceuticals  and
medical device maker Illumina . Those two companies this
year have rebounded 69 percent or more.

As he rebalances clients' portfolios this month, Jake
Dollarhide, head of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma,
is investing more in Kroger Co  and other supermarkets
that took a beating after Amazon.com  said in June it
was buying Whole Food Markets.

Kroger has lost 20 percent year to date and it recently
traded at 14 times expected earnings, compared to its five-year
average of 27.

"Grocery is local; it's not an internet play. And Kroger has
the footprint to not even notice that Amazon is around,"
Dollarhide said.

Investors following the Dogs of the Dow investment strategy
each year buy components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average
with the highest dividend yield, betting that those stocks have
been oversold. Currently, those companies include Verizon
Communications , International Business Machines 
and Exxon Mobil , all with dividend yields of 3.7 percent
or more.

Those three stocks were also Dogs of the Dow at the start of
this year, and they have underperformed. But an investor
following that strategy last December also would have bought
Boeing , which has nearly doubled in 2017, Caterpillar
, which is up 64 percent, and Cisco Systems ,
which has risen 28 percent.

 Company Name                     YTD Total       Dividend

 Return includes dividends

Nike  in 2016 suffered a 19-percent drop, making it
the worst-performing Dow component. In the past 12 months,
however, it has surged back with a 25 percent rally.

Due partly to increased competition from Nike, Under Armour
 has slumped 48 percent year to date, making it the S&P
500's third-worst-performing stock. Last January, most analysts
recommended buying Under Armour's shares and none recommended
selling. Now, most analysts are neutral on the yoga-pant
pioneer.

Underscoring the fallibility of analysts, four of the 10 S&P
500 worst-rated stocks at the end of last year are on track to
finish 2017 with annual increases above the index's 20-perent
gain.

Among them, domain name registration provider VeriSign
 has surged 53 percent, while Emerson Electric 
has rallied 24 percent, with much of that gain in the past month
after the industrial-automation systems maker abandoned its bid
for Rockwell Automation Inc .

U.S. oil drilling rig count holds steady this week -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20171222T225357.607+0000}}U.S. oil drilling rig count holds steady this week -Baker HughesDec 22 (Reuters)

Dec 22 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies kept the oil rig count unchanged this week, General Electric Co's Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday, even though crude prices hovered near their highest level since the summer of 2015.

The rig count , an early indicator of future output, held at 747 in the week to Dec. 22, still much higher than a year ago when only 523 rigs were active after energy companies boosted spending plans for 2017 as crude started recovering from a two-year price crash.

The increase in U.S. drilling lasted 14 months before stalling in August, September and October as some producers trimmed their 2017 spending plans after prices turned softer over the summer. Energy firms started adding rigs again in November as crude prices rose.

So far in 2017, U.S. crude futures have averaged about $51 a barrel, easily topping last year's $43.47 average. This week, futures traded at about $58 a barrel, putting them close to their highest since June 2015.

Looking ahead, futures were trading at $58 for the balance of 2018 and $55 for calendar 2019 .

In anticipation of higher prices in coming years, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said 21 of the roughly 65 E&Ps they track have already provided capital expenditure guidance for 2018 indicating a 13 percent increase in planned spending over 2017.

Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks said they would spend about $66.1 billion on drilling and completions in the lower 48 U.S. states in 2017, about 53 percent over what they planned to spend in 2016.

Cowen, which has its own U.S. rig count, said it expects a gradual decline in the count in the fourth quarter of 2017 and in 2018.

Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week slightly reduced their forecast for the total oil and natural gas rig count to an average of 876 in 2017, 999 in 2018 and 1,127 in 2019. Two weeks ago, it forecast 876 in 2017, 1,001 in 2018 and 1,128 in 2019.

There were 931 oil and natural gas rigs active on Dec. 22. The average number of rigs in service so far in 2017 was 875. That compares with 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. Most rigs produce both oil and gas.

U.S. shale oil production is expected to rise for a 13th consecutive month to a new record in January, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said. [nL1N1OI1I4]

Overall, U.S. production is expected to rise to 9.2 million barrels per day in 2017 and an all-time high of 10.0 million bpd in 2018 from 8.9 million bpd in 2016, according to a federal energy projection in December. [EIA/M]

U.S. output peaked on an annual basis at 9.6 million bpd in 1970, according to federal energy data.

UPDATE 1-Canada's CN Rail to buy 200 GE locomotives for future growth - 路透新闻

{{20171222T175736.974+0000}}UPDATE 1-Canada's CN Rail to buy 200 GE locomotives for future growthTORONTO, Dec 22 (Reuters)

(Adds context, updates stock price)

By Susan Taylor

TORONTO, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Canadian National Railway Co will buy 200 locomotives in the next three years from General Electric Co , Canada's biggest railway operator said on Friday, to support expected growth and drive efficiencies.

CN, Canada biggest railway operator, is extending a major hiring spree into 2018 as it scrambles to keep pace with demand and fill vacancies, aiming to add at least 2,000 more workers to the 3,500 it hired in 2017. [nL1N1NN1W4]

Montreal-based CN has been doing brisk business in western Canada, hauling bumper crops and intermodal containers to port, and has seen soaring volume of sand shipped for use in fracking shale rock to produce oil and gas.

Through the third quarter, volumes were up 14 percent compared with the same period last year, CN said, also reflecting gains in coal and automotive shipments.

"We are bullish on the North American economy and on our ability to compete and win new business with our superior service model," CN Chief Executive Luc Jobin said in a statement.

The order is the largest since 2014 among Class 1 railways, the biggest operators by operating revenues, CN said. Delivery is expected to begin in 2018, with the balance of locomotives, produced at GE's Fort Worth, Texas facility, in 2019 and 2020.

In coming years, growth is expected from domestic and international intermodal container shipments, sand and new grain terminals opening on CN routes, the company said at an investor presentation this summer.

CN shares were slightly higher at C$104.10 at mid-session on Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

Canada's CN Rail to buy 200 General Electric locomotives - 路透新闻

{{20171222T154636.451+0000}}Canada's CN Rail to buy 200 General Electric locomotivesDec 22 (Reuters)

Dec 22 (Reuters) - Canadian National Railway Co said on Friday it will buy 200 locomotives in the next three years from General Electric Co , betting on higher demand for crude oil transportation.

The move comes as oil and gas producers in Canada's energy-rich Alberta province clamor to get their barrels to market via rail amid supply disruptions resulting from a leak in TransCanada Corp's Keystone pipeline.

Crude-by-rail shipments are also expected to rise next year as supply from new projects increases and outpaces current pipeline capacity.

"We are bullish on the North American economy and on our ability to compete and win new business with our superior service model," CN Chief Executive Luc Jobin said in a statement. [nPn6rNfL9a]

Most railroad companies have lost money in the past when they expanded capacity only to face falling demand when oil prices collapsed in 2014 or when new pipelines began operation. Brent is now trading firmly above $60 a barrel.

Canadian National, the nation's biggest railway operator, said the purchase was the largest among Class I railways — the biggest railroads by operating revenues — since 2014.

The locomotives will be produced at GE's Fort Worth, Texas facility, CN said.

CN shares were slightly higher at C$104.24 on Friday morning on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

U.S. oil drillers cut rigs for first week in six -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20171215T180106.000+0000}}U.S. oil drillers cut rigs for first week in six -Baker HughesDec 15 (Reuters)

By Scott DiSavino

Dec 15 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies this week cut oil
rigs for the first time in six weeks in spite of prices rising
close to their highest in over two years and drillers starting
to boost spending plans for next year.

The oil rig count fell by four to 747 in the week to Dec.
15, General Electric Co's  Baker Hughes energy services
firm said in its closely followed report on Friday.

The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is
still much higher than a year ago when only 510 rigs were active
after energy companies boosted spending plans for 2017 as crude
started recovering from a two-year price crash.

The increase in U.S. drilling lasted 14 months before
briefly stalling in August, September and October as some
producers trimmed their 2017 spending plans after prices turned
softer over the summer. Energy firms started adding rigs again
in November as crude prices rose.

So far in 2017, U.S. crude futures  have averaged over
$50 a barrel, easily topping last year's $43.47 average. This
week, futures  traded around $57 a barrel, near their
highest since June 2015.

Looking ahead, futures were trading near $56 for calendar
2018  and $54 for calendar 2019 .

Financiers keep pouring cash into the shale oil sector,
providing producers with a path to keep U.S. output rising
through the middle of the next decade. [nL1N1OD2TA]

In anticipation of higher prices than in 2016, exploration
and production (E&P) companies increased their spending on U.S.
drilling and completions in 2017 by about 53 percent over 2016,
according to U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co.

Cowen said 19 of the roughly 65 E&Ps they track, including
EQT Corp , have already provided capital expenditure
guidance for 2018 indicating a 13 percent increase in planned
spending over 2017.

EQT said on Wednesday it expects to spend $2.4 billion in
2018, the majority of which will be to develop more wells in two
key shale formations in the Appalachian region. [nL3N1OD3UH]

Cowen, which has its own U.S. rig count, said it was
"intrigued by a sudden increase in rigs and will keep an eye on
it" but for now still expects a gradual decline in the count in
the fourth quarter of 2017 and in 2018.

There were 930 oil and natural gas rigs active on Dec. 15,
according to Baker Hughes. The average number of rigs in service
so far in 2017 was 874. That compares with 509 in 2016 and 978
in 2015. Most rigs produce both oil and gas.

U.S. production is expected to rise to 9.2 million bpd in
2017 and an all-time high of 10.0 million bpd in 2018 from 8.9
million bpd in 2016, according to a federal energy projection in
December. [EIA/M]

U.S. output peaked on an annual basis at 9.6 million bpd in
1970, according to federal energy data.

UPDATE 1-Siemens sees scale, data privacy as winners in digital race - 路透新闻

{{20171215T170134.000+0000}}UPDATE 1-Siemens sees scale, data privacy as winners in digital raceMUNICH, Dec 15 (Reuters)

* Industrial software platform race still wide open

* Siemens says size matters

* Siemens to partner with Amazon Web Services from next month

(Releads with comments from Digital Factory CEO)

By Georgina Prodhan

MUNICH, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Germany's Siemens sees its broad industrial base and respect for customers' data privacy as giving it the edge in a race to attract businesses to its factory software platform, rather than those of rivals.

The trains-to-turbines group is betting the future of its core industrial automation business on its MindSphere platform, which competes with General Electric's Predix and a host of others to help customers cut costs and improve productivity.

The race is still wide open, and being first to gather a critical mass of software developers and system integrators is crucial to winning customers, much as Apple's large developer community made its app store the most attractive.

"One thing is clear: Size matters," Jan Mrosik, chief executive of Siemens' 11.5 billion-euro Digital Factory division, told Reuters in an interview on Friday.

Siemens said it was targeting 1.25 million connected devices and systems by the end of its fiscal year in September, up from 1 million currently, as it expands its offering - previously focused on autos and aerospace - to cover all sectors.

MindSphere gathers data from devices, analyses the information and uses it to help customers design products faster and optimise processes.

To increase its attractiveness to developers, Siemens is partnering with Amazon Web Services (AWS) , the most popular cloud provider, as of next month.

So far, it has partnered with Germany's SAP - with whom it developed the platform - and from April it will also work with Microsoft's Azure.

Mrosik said Siemens' own experience of manufacturing in fields ranging from trains to building technology to energy equipment also gave it a solid basis of customers and expertise.

Simon Jacobson, supply-chain analyst at technology research group Gartner, tended to agree.

"Where Siemens has opportunity is to leverage its domain expertise across a range of sectors," he said, although he cautioned: "This is a market that's still rapidly unravelling."

Mrosik also highlighted Siemens' policy of keeping customers' data in silos that are only visible to them as a competitive advantage. "We as Siemens technically can't look into the data of anyone," he said.

BREAKEVEN

Digitally enhanced manufacturing is still in its infancy, with companies pursuing different strategies. But competition is already fierce, as evidenced by Emerson Electric's failed $29 billion bid to buy Rockwell Automation earlier this year. [nL3N1NY443]

Siemens is increasing research and development spending to over 5.6 billion euros this fiscal year from 5.2 billion last year, the lion's share of which will go to Digital Factory. MindSphere has a breakeven target date of 2020.

Siemens says it made 5.2 billion euros in digital revenues in the year to September. It has 23,000 in-house software developers, rivalling some of the world's biggest pure-play software companies.

"Digitalisation is starting to come together for Siemens," said Jefferies capital goods analyst Peter Reilly.

General Electric is reducing investment in its Predix industrial software platform by about $400 million this coming year to $1.2 billion, and focusing solely on its own installed base of customers for the rollout.

Under new Chief Executive John Flannery, GE as a whole is narrowing its focus and shedding businesses with around $20 billion in revenue. [LINK]

GE aims to double Predix revenues to $1 billion in 2018. ($1 = 0.8485 euros)

Siemens partners with Amazon as it ramps up industrial software platform - 路透新闻

{{20171215T112504.543+0000}}Siemens partners with Amazon as it ramps up industrial software platformMUNICH, Dec 15 (Reuters)

By Georgina Prodhan

MUNICH, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Siemens is partnering with Amazon as it accelerates the rollout of its MindSphere industrial software platform, the core of its bid to dominate the market in digital factory automation.

The German group's next version of MindSphere, to be launched in January, will run on Amazon Web Services (AWS) - the most popular cloud system with industrial software developers.

"Many customers appreciate it very much," Siemens Chief Technology Officer Roland Busch told reporters and analysts at a company presentation in Munich on Friday. "You have to really scale up in order to justify your money."

So far, MindSphere has run on the SAP cloud, and from April it will also run on Microsoft's Azure.

MindSphere gathers data from devices, analyses the information and uses it to help customers optimise processes. Attracting a critical mass of developers to work on the platform is crucial to improving the quality of software applications.

MindSphere is one of a number of so-called Internet-of-Things platforms being developed by industrial companies racing to help their manufacturing customers improve productivity, where growth has been slowing in developed countries.

The technology was thrown into sharp focus in August by Emerson Electric's failed $29 billion bid to buy Rockwell Automation . [nL3N1NY443]

The area is still in its infancy, with companies pursuing different strategies, although Siemens is generally considered to be leading the pack, helped by more than $5 billion of acquisitions in the past two years and by arch-rival General Electric's partial retreat as it narrows focus.

Siemens said it was targeting 1.25 million connected devices and systems by the end of its fiscal year in September, up from 1 million currently, as it expands its offering - previously focused on autos and aerospace - to cover all sectors.

It is increasing research and development spending to over 5.6 billion euros ($6.6 billion) this fiscal year from 5.2 billion last year, the lion's share of which will go to its Digital Factory division.

UPDATE 3-Delta Air Lines to place order for Airbus jets - 路透新闻

{{20171214T134832.000+0000}}UPDATE 3-Delta Air Lines to place order for Airbus jetsNEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters)

(Updates share price, adds background, details)

NEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines said on Thursday it will place a firm order for 100 Airbus A321neo jets and an optional order for 100 of the aircraft.

Delta, the No. 2 U.S. airline by passenger traffic, said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it expects deliveries to begin in the first quarter of 2020, with new aircraft arriving through 2023.

CNN and Reuters reported yesterday that Airbus had beaten out rival Boeing Co for the order, boosting Airbus' leading share of the market for narrowbody models, while highlighting the increasingly fraught relationship between Delta and Chicago-based Boeing.

The two U.S. companies' relationship began to fray in October when Boeing successfully lobbied the U.S. Commerce Department to propose trade duties of nearly 300 percent on Delta's order of CSeries jets from Canada's Bombardier Inc . [nL2N1MH1AQ]

The carrier declined to say whether the disagreement between the two planemakers had any effect on its decision to go with Airbus.

"This is the right transaction at the right time for our customers, our employees and our shareholders," Chief Executive Ed Bastian said in a statement.

Delta's decision also gives lift to United Technologies subsidiary Pratt & Whitney, which the carrier said had won the contract for the engines that will power the A321neo aircraft.

In the same SEC filing, Delta also said it now expects operating margin of 11 percent for the fourth quarter, compared with the 11 percent to 13 percent it had previously forecast

Delta Air Lines' shares were up 2.9 percent at $55.21 in afternoon trading.

European industry officials hailed the jet order as an endorsement of Airbus's presence in the United States, where it opened an assembly plant in Mobile, Alabama, in 2015, in the hopes of further penetrating the U.S. market.

That plant is at the center of the Boeing-Bombardier trade dispute since it is where the Canadian company plans to assemble jets for Delta under the CSeries airliner program, which has since been acquired by Airbus. [nL2N1MS02E]

Delta's order is expected to involve discounts of well over 50 percent from the $12.7 billion catalog value, an aircraft market source said.

CFM International, a French-American engine venture that lost out to Pratt & Whitney, suggested the pricing was aggressive.

"The financial terms reached a level that simply were not in the best interest of our shareholders," the company, co-owned by General Electric and Safran , said in a statement.

UPDATE 2-Hitachi UK nuclear project expects government funding outline in H1 2018 - 路透新闻

{{20171214T113416.000+0000}}UPDATE 2-Hitachi UK nuclear project expects government funding outline in H1 2018LONDON, Dec 14 (Reuters)

* Hitachi gains approval for reactor design

* Govt has been criticised for previous nuclear deal

* Two Hitachi projects could power over 10 mln homes

(Recasts story with expectations of support deal, updates with comment)

By Susanna Twidale and Nina Chestney

LONDON, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Hitachi's Horizon Nuclear Power unit expects to see an outline from Britain's government in the first half of next year on how it will help finance a nuclear project in Wales, the company said on Thursday.

Britain is seeking new ways to fund nuclear projects after criticism over a deal awarded to France's EDF to build the first nuclear plant in Britain for 20 years, which could cost consumers 30 billion pounds ($40 billion). [nL8N1NR3J8]

"We are having positive discussions with the government ... which we hope will result in an outline for a deal in the first half of next year," a spokesman for Horizon told Reuters.

Britain needs to replace ageing nuclear reactors and coal plants coming offline in the 2020s but new large plants have struggled to be built due to high up-front costs.

A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the Horizon project was part of efforts to put Britain "at the forefront of future technologies which have the potential to create value and jobs across the UK."

Hitachi's Horizon plans to construct at least 5.4 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity at two sites in Britain – the first at Wylfa Newydd in Wales and a second at Oldbury-on-Severn in England.

Horizon said the two projects could generate enough electricity to power 10 million homes and create tens of thousands of jobs.

Britain's nuclear regulator on Thursday approved the Hitachi-GE's <6501.T> advanced boiling water nuclear reactor design it plans to use at the sites.

The Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) said it was satisfied Hitachi-GE's reactor met the necessary safety, security and environmental protection standards for it to be used in plants in Britain.

"(This) is a significant step in our regulation of the overall process to construct this type of reactor in the UK, ensuring that the generic design meets the highest standards of safety," said Mark Foy, ONR's chief nuclear inspector.

Separately, South Korea's state utility Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO) said last week it had been picked as a preferred bidder for Toshiba's NuGen nuclear project in Britain, throwing the troubled project a lifeline.

KEPCO said in a statement the company planned to negotiate with Toshiba over the next few months to buy a stake in the nuclear project and sign a deal in the first half of next year if the negotiation progressed smoothly.

Big firms call on EU to set 35 pct renewable power supplies target - 路透新闻

{{20171213T114245.122+0000}}Big firms call on EU to set 35 pct renewable power supplies targetBRUSSELS, Dec 13 (Reuters) - A group of big technology, industry and power companies have called on the European Union to set a target for renewables of at least 35 percent when EU energy ministers meet next week.

The energy-hungry firms, including Amazon , Facebook , Google , IKEA , Microsoft , Philips and Unilever , say an ambitious target would encourage their investment in multi-year wind and solar power supply contracts, known as Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs).

In a letter, the 50 big firms called on EU energy ministers to lift all regulatory barriers to PPAs, to which firms are increasingly turning to source electricity needed for energy-intensive data centres or to run heavy machinery.

The target now being discussed by EU nations is for the bloc to source at least 27 percent of its energy from renewables by 2030 - up from the 20 percent goal for green energy by 2020. The European Parliament has called for a higher target. The final law will result from negotiations between the two bodies.

"The post 2020 Renewable Energy Directive has a key role to play to unlock the potential of corporate renewable PPAs, which remains largely untapped in Europe," the firms said.

"A strong investment signal is key to further positioning industries with large investment potential in supporting Europe's clean energy goals."

As EU governments cut back on subsidies for wind power, many developers say they are turning to PPAs as a new source of revenue to get projects financed.

The letter highlights that in the last two months alone, more than a gigawatt of renewable energy capacity, mostly from wind turbines, was contracted through corporate renewable PPAs.

The new EU renewable targets are part of a set of proposals to implement the bloc's climate goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.

{{20171208T180604.724+0000}}U.S. drillers add oil rigs for 3rd week in a row -Baker HughesDec 8 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies this week added oil
rigs for a third week in a row, the longest string of increases
since summer, as higher crude prices prompt drillers to return
to the well pad after a break in the autumn.

Drillers added two oil rigs in the week to Dec. 8, bringing
the total count up to 751, the highest level since September,
General Electric Co's  Baker Hughes energy services firm
said in its closely followed report on Friday.

The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is
still much higher than a year ago when only 498 rigs were active
after energy companies boosted spending plans for 2017 as crude
started recovering from a two-year price crash around the same
time OPEC agreed to the production cuts a year ago.

Last week, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries and non-OPEC producers led by Russia agreed to extend
oil output cuts of about 1.8 million barrels per day until the
end of 2018 as they try to finish clearing a global glut of
crude. [nL8N1O01I9]

The increase in U.S. drilling lasted 14 months before
stalling in August, September and October as some producers
trimmed their 2017 spending plans after prices turned softer
over the summer. Energy firms started adding rigs again in
November as crude prices rose.

So far in 2017, U.S. crude futures  have averaged over
$50 a barrel, easily topping last year's $43.47 average. This
week, futures traded near $57 a barrel, just below their highest
since June 2015.

Looking ahead, futures were trading near $57 for calendar
2018  and $54 for calendar 2019 .

In anticipation of higher prices than in 2016, exploration
and production (E&P) companies increased their spending on U.S.
drilling and completions in 2017 by about 53 percent over 2016,
according to U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co.

In addition, Cowen said 17 of the 64 E&Ps they track,
including Chevron Corp , have already provided capital
expenditure guidance for 2018 indicating a 17 percent increase
in planned spending over 2017.

Chevron this week said it planned to boost U.S. upstream
capital expenditures to $6.6 billion in 2018 from $5.7 billion
in 2017. [nL1N1O701S][nBw7L0v7Ha][nBw6JXStRa]

Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S.
investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week boosted their forecast
for the total oil and natural gas rig count to an average of 876
in 2017, 1,001 in 2018 and 1,128 in 2019. Two weeks ago, it
forecast 874 in 2017, 927 in 2018 and 1,074 in 2019.

There were 931 oil and natural gas rigs active on Dec. 8.
The average number of rigs in service so far in 2017 was 873.
That compares with 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. Most rigs
produce both oil and gas.

Wall St Week Ahead-Tax-loss selling to pressure 2017's losers in December - 路透新闻

{{20171208T161958.079+0000}}Wall St Week Ahead-Tax-loss selling to pressure 2017's losers in DecemberBy Chuck Mikolajczak

NEW YORK, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Stocks that have been lackluster so far in 2017 are unlikely to see their fortunes reversed in the final month of the year, as investors engage in tax-harvesting practices before the new year.

Investors often exercise tax-loss selling strategies, dumping stocks that have performed poorly in order to reduce or eliminate capital gains taxes, as the year draws to a close.

"This is something we do every December, we take losses for clients who we've created gains for," said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

"Your clients want their cake and they want to eat it too - so they want to see an 8 to 12 percent return in any given year and they'd like to also not have to pay capital gains taxes."

Tax overhaul negotiations in Washington have also added a potential wrinkle this year, as investors may wait until a clearer picture emerges. An investor seeking to divest a stock from their portfolio may hold off until January to delay paying taxes until the following year.

"There are a lot of people waiting on tax reform to make those decisions," said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O'Neil Securities in New York.

Stocks that were among the worst performing on the benchmark S&P 500 index in 2016 saw losses mount in the final month of that year. TripAdvisor fell 4 percent in December before closing the year with a loss of nearly 46 percent. Vertex Pharmaceuticals dropped nearly 10 percent for the month to close out the year with a decline of 41.5 percent.

That selling has often led to what is referred to by market participants as the "January effect," when stocks, particularly smallcap names, that may have been sold in December for tax harvesting, experience a rebound the following month.

Investors are prevented from selling shares for tax harvesting purposes and buying them, or shares in a similar stock, within 30 days by an Internal Revenue Service regulation against what is known as a "wash sale." That wait period helps create a lag before the beaten-down stocks rebound.

BUYING OPPORTUNITIES

However, identifying stocks that may be potential buying opportunities because of tax harvesting strategies has become more difficult.

Many mutual funds share a fiscal year-end date at the conclusion of October and may start to sell for tax purposes in September. In addition, investors have become attuned to the practice and no longer limit the selling to December.

"Tax loss selling is like holiday shopping, it happens earlier and earlier every year," said Nicholas Colas, co-founder at DataTrek Research in New York.

At the start of 2017, TripAdvisor bounced back with a 14.1 percent rally for January, and Vertex surged 16.6 percent compared with the 1.8 percent S&P 500 <.SPX> gain for the month.

Among smallcap names, Mirati Therapeutics tumbled 11.2 percent in December 2016 en route to a drop of about 85 percent for the year. The stock rebounded sharply at the start of 2017, with a jump of over 7 percent in January.

Among the worst performers for the year on the S&P 500, Under Armour and Range Resources have slumped more than 50 percent, while Signet Jewelers and General Electric have lost more than 40 percent. On a sector basis, energy has struggled across the market cap spectrum for the year.

Further complicating matters this year was the strong performance registered by equities in September and October.

While those two months are historically a difficult time for the stock market, the S&P 500 rose roughly 2 percent in September and October, while the smallcap Russell 2000 index <.RUT> jumped 6 percent in September and tacked on another 0.8 percent in October.

"This year, we had pretty good performance in September and October," said Steve DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies in New York. "Now it is up to other things like tax that is going to be more of a driver."

BREAKINGVIEWS-Fossil-fuel slowdown spreads pain at GE and beyond - 路透新闻

{{20171207T213701.984+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Fossil-fuel slowdown spreads pain at GE and beyond(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Lauren Silva Laughlin

DALLAS, Dec 7 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The ebbing of fossil fuels is sapping energy from GE - and beyond. The conglomerate is laying off 12,000 people in a power division that lights up 30 percent of the world. It blamed overcapacity amid a shift from coal and gas to renewable energy. But other divisions are closely tied to fossil fuels, too. Its troubles suggest a wider shakeout is in the offing.

The company's power division makes turbines for electricity-generating plants around the world. Most of those plants have traditionally been driven by coal and natural gas, along with nuclear, but alternatives are coming on fast. The International Energy Agency predicts renewables will account for 40 percent of global power generation by 2040, up from 24 percent in 2016. Coal's market share is projected to shrink significantly.

Other GE businesses are tied to fossil fuels in one way or another. Revenue at the company's transportation business, which makes diesel-powered locomotives, fell 14 percent in the third quarter from the same period last year.

New Chief Executive John Flannery said at an investor presentation last month that the company may sell this group, in part because of secular declines in U.S. coal shipments by rail. He has also formed a committee to review the company's 62.5 percent stake in Baker Hughes , an oil and gas servicing company that is directly tied to growth in drilling business. In aggregate, with the power division, these three groups generated nearly half the group's revenue in the third quarter.

GE is starting to switch its business mix in the right direction. It has a renewable energy group that was bolstered by its acquisition of Alstom in 2015. Meanwhile, the cuts announced Thursday will save $1 billion a year in expenses.

Competitor Siemens , which announced a smaller round of power layoffs last month, may have encouraged GE to scale down. Others should take note of the shifts in the global energy market too. Fossil fuels appear to be starting to power down for the long term. Those who get ahead of the change may be able to bring new things to life.

CONTEXT NEWS

- General Electric's Power division said on Dec. 7 it would cut 12,000 jobs around the world. The moves, combined with earlier cutbacks, will reduce annual expenses by $1 billion, it said.

- The company said it was "right-sizing the business" in the face of overcapacity in electricity generation, lower plant utilization rates and outages, and growth in renewables.

- "This decision was painful but necessary for GE Power to respond to the disruption in the power market, which is driving significantly lower volumes in products and services," said Russell Stokes, president and chief executive of GE Power.

UPDATE 3-General Electric to cut 12,000 jobs in power business revamp - 路透新闻

{{20171207T172840.486+0000}}UPDATE 3-General Electric to cut 12,000 jobs in power business revamp(Adds detail, union reaction)

By John Revill and Alwyn Scott

ZURICH/LAS VEGAS, Dec 7 (Reuters) - General Electric Co said Thursday it is axing 12,000 jobs at its global power business, the struggling industrial conglomerate's latest effort to shrink itself into a more focused company.

The U.S. company launched the cuts to save $1 billion in 2018 at its Power business, saying it expects dwindling demand for fossil fuel power plants to continue. GE's cuts follow a decision by rival Siemens AG to slash 6,900 jobs in the face of a global shift by electric utilities away from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy such as wind and solar. [nL8N1NM5IN]

GE did not give a breakdown of the job cuts, which represent about 4 percent of its overall workforce of 295,000, saying only that they would be primarily outside the United States. The cuts represent about 18 percent of GE's Power business, GE said.

The announcement cast a spotlight on GE's decision to spend 9.7 billion euros ($10.7 billion when the deal closed in 2015) on the energy business of France's Alstom . The deal rounded out GE Power's portfolio by adding steam and nuclear capabilities to its mainly natural gas turbine power business.

But the purchase came just as demand for new power plants was slowing, in part due to competition from wind and solar systems.

"Traditional power markets including gas and coal have softened," GE said on Thursday, explaining the decision for the job cuts.

Rumors of sweeping job cuts were confirmed by labor union sources on Wednesday, with staff in Switzerland, Germany and Britain among those badly hit. [nL8N1O63PO]

Unite, the largest trade union in Britain and Ireland, said the announcement put 1,100 jobs at risk and it vowed to fight against any compulsory layoffs in the UK.

GE risks "cutting too far, too fast," to deal with the changing power market.

But GE said the cuts were essential, since sales of new power plants are falling. Industry estimates expect sales of about 110 to 120 new gas-powered turbines a year, but capacity at GE and other major suppliers is about four times that.

"This decision was painful but necessary for GE Power to respond to the disruption in the power market, which is driving significantly lower volumes in products and services," said Russell Stokes, head of GE Power.

"Power will remain a work in progress in 2018. We expect market challenges to continue, but this plan will position us for 2019 and beyond."

A senior GE executive said jobs in France would not be hit because of an agreement when GE purchased Alstom. [nZ8N1I500Y]

GE shares, part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI>, were up 1.4 percent at $17.92 in midday trading.

SHRINKING EMPIRE

New GE Chief Executive John Flannery last month outlined plans to shrink GE's sprawling empire of businesses built up by predecessors Jeff Immelt and Jack Welch, whose strategy was based on spreading risk across a broad range of industries.

GE has previously said it would exit its lighting, transportation, industrial solutions and electrical grid businesses. It also plans to ditch its 62.5-percent stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes .

In Thursday's layoffs, nearly a third of the company's 4,500-strong Swiss workforce could be cut, while 16 percent of staff in Germany are also likely to be axed. [nFWN1O70FE]

GE said it had begun talks with labor leaders about the steps.

Union leaders in Germany reacted angrily to the job cuts.

"The announcement by GE that it wants to cut thousands of jobs across Europe is neither strategically nor economically justifiable," said Klaus Stein, the representative of the IG Metall Union at GE's plant in Mannheim.

"We are not going to accept this, and we will fight ... to preserve jobs."

Demand for new thermal power plants dramatically dropped in all rich countries, GE said, while traditional utility customers have reduced their investments due to market deterioration and uncertainty about future climate policy measures.

Hardly any new power station projects had been commissioned in Germany in recent years, GE said. Heightened Asian competition had also increased price pressures.

General Electric says France to be spared power business job cuts - 路透新闻

{{20171207T161904.201+0000}}General Electric says France to be spared power business job cutsZURICH, Dec 7 (Reuters) - General Electric's decision to axe 12,000 jobs from its struggling power business will not hit its French operations, a senior GE executive told Reuters on Thursday. [nL1N1O713Q]

"When GE bought Alstom Energy there was a contractual requirement and commitment to the French government that France would not be affected by reductions for a certain period of time," Michael Rechsteiner, the head of GE Power Services Europe, said in a telephone interview after the job cuts news.

"We are honouring our commitment."

GE spent 9.7 billion euros (then worth $10.7 billion) in 2015 to buy the energy business of France's Alstom . The deal aimed to round out GE Power's portfolio by adding steam turbine capabilities to its mainly natural gas turbine power business.

Rechsteiner defended the purchase.

"What we really like about Alstom is the installed base, the services business and the capability in the steam world, and in the [engineering] world," he said.

"They were and still are really complementary to our GE capabilities. The Alstom deal still does make a lot of sense."

In Britain, around 1,100 position will be affected, the company said. Globally GE employed 295,000 people worldwide at the end of 2016, according to the company website.

GE said it had begun talks with labour leaders about the steps.

Union leaders in Germany reacted angrily to the job cuts.

"The announcement by GE that it wants to cut thousands of jobs across Europe is neither strategically nor economically justifiable, and serves only to maximize short-term profit for shareholders," said Klaus Stein, the representative of the IG Metall Union at GE's plant in Mannheim.

Hardly any new power station projects had been commissioned in Germany in recent years, GE said. Heightened Asian competition had also increased price pressures.

GE rival Siemens is cutting about 6,900 jobs, or close to 2 percent of its global workforce, mainly at its power and gas division, which has been hit by the rapid growth of renewables. [nL8N1NM5IN]

UPDATE 2-Qatar flexes financial muscle with 12 bln euros of French deals - 路透新闻

{{20171207T120636.547+0000}}UPDATE 2-Qatar flexes financial muscle with 12 bln euros of French deals* World's largest LNG exporter boycotted by neighbours

* Qatar signs deals for fighter jets, armoured vehicles

* France's Macron seeks to play go-between in region

(Writes through)

By Hadeel Al Sayegh

DOHA, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Qatar will buy fighter jets and armoured vehicles as part of 12 billion euros worth of commercial contracts it agreed with France on Thursday, bolstering its military capability and its international ties as it faces a boycott by other Arab states.

The latest contracts underscored how Doha can use the wealth it has accumulated as the world's biggest exporter of liquified natural gas to defy some of the largest and wealthiest Arab countries.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and trade relations with the emirate almost six months ago. They accuse the Qataris of backing terrorism, which Qatar denies.

"Our position on this blockade was very clear. Qatar's position was very clear - to resolve this problem, if we saw problems between us and our neighbors - we should be at a table and speak honestly," Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani said at a news conference alongside French President Emmanuel Macron.

Macron, who has tried to play a mediation role between the sides, was in Doha to discuss how to combat the financing of terrorism at a time when the Middle East is locked in a regional power struggle between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Iran.

"Restoring stability to the Gulf is a priority for us because we have a lot of friends here," Macron said. "Our wish is that we find a quick resolution to today's situation."

Paris has strong commercial and political ties with Qatar. It has promoted deeper business interests in the country and encouraged Qatari investment in France, where the Gulf state already has assets of about $10 billion.

Macron said some 12 billion euros ($14.13 billion) worth of deals were agreed on Thursday. They included Qatar's taking up an option from 2015 to buy 12 more Dassault Aviation-made Rafale fighters, and saying it could purchase a further 36. It has already bought 24 planes for about 6 billion euros, including missiles.

It also committed to buying 490 armoured vehicles from defence firm Nexter.

Doha has repeatedly called for dialogue with its neighbours, although it has strengthened its military as relations with them have deteriorated. It has secured this year alone military equipment deals with the United States, Russia and Britain.

"In total, it amounts to nearly 12 billion euros which was signed today and which underlines the closeness of our economic cooperation," Macron said.

Among other deals signed, Suez A will dredge and clean Qatar's lagoon and a rail consortium of RATP and SNCF will build and operate a metro system in the Qatari capital.

Qatar Airways also placed a new order for Airbus A321neo civilian aircraft to replace an earlier A320neo order. The new deal for larger planes is worth an extra $930 million at current list prices for Airbus and involves a switch of engine supplier to a French-American venture co-owned by Safran < and General Electric .

General Electric to cut 12,000 jobs in power business revamp - 路透新闻

{{20171207T115728.387+0000}}General Electric to cut 12,000 jobs in power business revampBy John Revill

ZURICH, Dec 7 (Reuters) - General Electric Co announced on Thursday it was axing 12,000 jobs at its global power business as the struggling industrial conglomerate responds to dwindling demand for fossil fuel power plants.

The U.S. company launched the cuts to save $1 billion in 2018, saying it expected current difficulties in the sector to continue.

"Traditional power markets including gas and coal have softened," GE said.

Rumours of sweeping job cuts were confirmed by labour union sources on Wednesday [nL8N1O63PO], with staff in Switzerland and Germany among those badly hit.

"This decision was painful but necessary for GE Power to respond to the disruption in the power market, which is driving significantly lower volumes in products and services," said Russell Stokes, head of GE Power.

"Power will remain a work in progress in 2018. We expect market challenges to continue, but this plan will position us for 2019 and beyond."

A third of the company's Swiss workforce face layoffs, while 16 percent of its staff in Germany are also likely to be axed in the shake up. [nFWN1O70FE]

GE said it had begun talks with labour leaders about the steps.

Demand for new thermal power plants dramatically dropped in all rich countries, GE said, while traditional utility customers have reduced their investments due to market deterioration and uncertainty about future climate policy measures.

Hardly any new power station projects had been commissioned in Germany in recent years, GE said. Heightened Asian competition had also increased price pressures.

Last month, General Electric CEO John Flannery outlined plans to reduce the manufacturing footprint of GE's power business to respond to a sharp fall in demand for fossil fuel power equipment. GE had not specified how many jobs would be cut or where.

GE rival Siemens is cutting about 6,900 jobs, or close to 2 percent of its global workforce, mainly at its power and gas division, which has been hit by the rapid growth of renewables. [nL8N1NM5IN]

Dec 6 (Reuters) - General Electric Co plans to cut as many as 4,500 jobs in Europe as the U.S. industrial conglomerate shrinks its troubled power generation business, a labor union source said on Tuesday.

The cuts, which are linked to businesses GE bought from France's Alstom in 2015, will affect employees in Switzerland, Germany and Britain, said French newspaper Les Echos, which first reported the news on Tuesday.

The union source confirmed the layoff numbers to Reuters on Wednesday and said an official announcement was expected as early as Thursday.

GE did not confirm the numbers but said it was "reviewing its operations to ensure the business is best positioned to respond to our market realities and for long-term success." The company had presented a proposal to the European body representing legacy Alstom employees, it added.

Last month, GE Power Chief Executive Russell Stokes said the company could reduce its global footprint by 30 percent.

GE shares were down less than 1 percent on Wednesday afternoon. The stock has fallen about 44 percent since the start of the year and is the year's worst performer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI>.

GE acquired about 65,000 Alstom employees, $20 billion in annual revenue and dozens of field offices and manufacturing sites around the world when it bought the power assets of the French company in 2015, according to regulatory filings and presentations at the time.

The acquisition rounded out GE's Power portfolio by adding steam turbine capabilities, adding to GE's mostly natural gas turbine power business. It also gave GE a larger installed base of plants to service. But the deal came just as demand for new power plants was slowing, in part due to competition from cost-competitive wind and solar systems.

Last month, General Electric CEO John Flannery outlined plans to cut back GE's power business to respond to a sharp fall in demand for fossil fuel power equipment. GE did not specify how many jobs would be cut or where.

The reported layoffs are part of GE Power's plan to integrate GE's energy connections and power businesses, seeking to save $1 billion in costs next year and another $500 million in 2019, William Blair analyst Nicholas Heymann said.

"Renewables will not have any reductions because the world is rapidly shifting from fossil to renewables as the cost of temporarily storing power becomes more affordable at $100/Kw for power packs," Heymann added, referring to GE's renewable energy business.

Due to the weakness in its power business, GE last month lowered its earnings forecast and slashed its dividend by half, expecting to save about $4 billion in cash annually. [nL3N1NJ3GQ]

GE aims to reduce overhead costs by $1 billion this year and $2 billion in 2018 as Flannery, who took the top job in August, prepares to refocus the 125-year-old conglomerate toward aviation, healthcare and power.

GE has already shed 25 percent of its corporate staff or some 1,500 jobs around the world.

Flannery's plans include hiving off at least $20 billion of assets through sales, spin-offs or other means and retaining only business that offer growth, a leading market position and a large installed base.

GUIDE TO EU MERGER PROCESS

DEADLINES:

The European Commission has 25 working days after a deal is filed for a first-stage review. It may extend that by 10 working days to 35 working days, to consider either a company's proposed remedies or an EU member state's request to handle the case.

Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90 additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working days.

SIMPLIFIED:

Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved.

RPT-ANALYSIS-Earnings focus drives violent stock swings, creating opportunities - 路透新闻

{{20171205T091054.127+0000}}RPT-ANALYSIS-Earnings focus drives violent stock swings, creating opportunities(Adds ANALYSIS tag)

* Results-day price moves were often extreme

* Investors home in on earnings, engine of market returns

* Divergent stock moves create fertile ground for active investors

By Helen Reid

LONDON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Shares reacted much more violently than usual to surprises in company results in the latest quarterly reporting season as investors put a laser-like focus on earnings, generously rewarding winners but mercilessly punishing laggards.

It's a phenomenon that runs counter to the generally depressed levels of volatility at the stock index level, and presents opportunities for investors in derivatives trading as well as in traditional stock-picking.

Stock markets around the world have surged to a succession of record highs this year, but, far from a rising tide lifting all boats, the gap between winners and losers is widening.

Earnings day price moves have been the most extreme on record, Goldman Sachs strategists said, with stocks notching up 3.6 times the average daily move after results.

The sharp swings show investors are focusing strongly on individual company performance and underline the crucial importance of strong earnings.

"We have something like record low index volatility, but individual stock volatility is not low at all and we have seen a spike up in individual stock vol(atility)," Luke Ellis, CEO of Man Group, told Reuters at an investment summit.

The stock market's verdict on individual companies differed sharply, providing a "fantastic opportunity" for stock pickers to beat the index, he said.

This results season has seen blue-chip companies like General Electric in the United States sink 13 percent, while European investors punished both EDF and Burberry to the tune of one-tenth of their market value and Nokia by 18 percent on earnings day.

Companies with strong earnings have also been rewarded more than usual, correcting the negative skew seen last quarter where earnings misses were punished more severely than beats were celebrated.

"If the big move is coming from earnings then it's telling you there's a lot of exuberance about earnings growing," said Amit Khanna, head of equity research at QuantInsight.

"And if that's not the case and a company misses, you will have a lot of disappointment."

As Eric Moore, income fund manager at Miton Group put it: "When companies disappoint they're getting properly spanked. The market is in an unforgiving mood."

HEIGHTENED SENSITIVITY

Part of investors' heightened sensitivity is because earnings have been the driving force behind stock markets' stellar gains this year - and are expected to drive risk appetite through 2018.

"2018 is going to be a perfectly decent year for risk assets, on the assumption we get another decent year of profit growth," Standard Life's head of global strategy, Andrew Milligan, told Reuters last week. "Profits are still the be-all and end-all for the coming year."

The majority of returns in equities this year have been driven by earnings rather than by the value of a company growing through improved performance, Credit Suisse figures showed.

In Europe year-to-date, gains have been almost entirely earnings-led - with 85 percent of returns driven by growth in earnings per share. In emerging markets that figure is 70 percent while the United States owes 50 percent of its returns to earnings, the Credit Suisse figures show.

Knowing that returns are so highly dependent on companies' bottom line, investors have been ruthless. While the shares of tantalisingly fast-growing companies have skyrocketed this year, investors' patience with mediocre results has run thin.

The phenomenon could also be linked to investors piling into equities, NN Investment Partners CIO Valentijn van Niewenhuijzen said.

Global investors' allocation to equities rose to a net 49 percent overweight in November, the highest since April 2015, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's (BAML) fund manager survey showed.

Higher stock volatility has not translated into greater average index volatility, partly because the large earnings-day moves were often corrected the following day.

"Investors have been very, very quick to buy the dip and that's equivalent to fading the volatility spikes, which therefore have not been very long-lived," said Abhinandan Deb, EMEA head of equity derivatives at BAML.

Confidence in the underlying economic growth driving the market put the brakes on any drawn-out sell-offs in stocks.

All of this adds up to a perfect environment for stock-picking, a boon for active managers fighting to win back flows which have been pouring into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other passive vehicles this year.

"The opportunity set for making money from stock-picking is higher than it's been before," said Deb.

SIGN OF STRAIN?

Goldman Sachs strategists, who observed this pattern in Europe and the United States, said skittishness in stocks on earnings days, combined with generally calmer moves outside of results, was a sign of increased uncertainty under the surface.

Data from the bank's U.S. strategists shows a rise in single stock volatility is generally associated with a decline in equity returns.

"While they do not believe this is a reason to sell the market (or buy VIX (the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index)) it is certainly a trend to be monitoring closely," Goldman strategists wrote.

Rather than worrying about volatility affecting returns, some investors have taken advantage of the phenomenon to reap returns in derivatives markets.

Investors piled into a "dispersion trade" this year, buying stock volatility and selling index volatility. This relative trade bets on stock correlations falling while hedging against the possibility that volatility might remain low.

"This strategy has been very popular this year, with strong volumes traded on the EuroSTOXX 50 and the S&P 500 by hedge funds and asset managers," said Kokou Agbo-Bloua, global head of flow strategy at Societe Generale.

It is also a less costly strategy than being outright long volatility, Agbo-Bloua added.

As market volatility starts to show signs of life, investment vehicles tracking lower volatility stocks have also been performing better. Fidelity's low volatility factor ETF made its strongest gains in nine months in November.

"In a rising volatility environment, there is likely to be demand for low volatility assets (which become scarcer)," Goldman strategists said.

General Electric lays off workers at power business in New York - Reuters News

{{20171201T224708.030+0000}}General Electric lays off workers at power business in New YorkBy Alwyn Scott

NEW YORK, Dec 1 (Reuters) - General Electric Co said on Friday it was laying off workers at its power division in Schenectady, New York, as it tries to reduce costs after a steep profit drop at the division.

GE declined to disclose the number of workers affected.

A report by local ABC TV affiliate News10, citing sources inside GE's Schenectady plant, said about 75 people had been notified that they are being let go.

So far this year, GE has laid off at least 75 other workers in New York state, according to state records.

GE Chief Executive John Flannery, who took over in August, has promised to cut $1 billion in company spending this year and $2 billion in 2018, as the company grapples with its weak financial results and declining share price. GE's profit fell about 9 percent in the third quarter. [nL4N1MV3IM]

GE has grounded corporate jets, eliminated company cars for hundreds of executives, delayed part of its Boston headquarters and reduced employment in many locations.

The company has also changed a number of top executives, including installing a new CFO, and plans to exit more than $20 billion in business in the next two years.

"GE has previously announced a plan to reduce $3 billion in cost by the end of 2018," the company said in a statement. "Those actions include, but are not limited to, employee reductions, which have been under way for many months."

GE said "a significant decline in orders" at GE Power prompted the layoffs in Schenectady. Workers will receive severance and help finding new jobs, GE said.

GE's downsizing is not limited to its power division. In July, the company disclosed plans to lay off 575 workers at a railroad locomotive plant in Erie, Pennsylvania. An August report commissioned by the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America Local 506, which represents the workers, estimated they earn about $108,000 a year in pay and benefits.

U.S. drillers add oil rigs for 2nd week in a row -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20171201T180600.536+0000}}U.S. drillers add oil rigs for 2nd week in a row -Baker HughesDec 1 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies this week added oil
rigs for a second week in a row as crude prices traded near
their highest levels since the summer of 2015 as major oil
producing countries extended a global deal to limit supply.

Drillers added two oil rigs in the week to Dec. 1, bringing
the total count up to 749, the highest since September, General
Electric Co's  Baker Hughes energy services firm said in
its closely followed report on Friday.

U.S. producers applauded Thursday's decision by the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC
producers led by Russia to extend oil output cuts of about 1.8
million barrels per day beyond March until the end of 2018 as
they try to finish clearing a global glut of crude. [nL1N1O10GC]
[nL8N1O01I9]

Rising U.S. production, however, has been a thorn in OPEC's
side, undermining the impact of its output curbs.

U.S. production rose to 9.5 million bpd in September, its
highest monthly output since reaching 9.6 million bpd in April
2015, according to federal energy data going back to 2005. On an
annual basis, U.S. output peaked at 9.6 million bpd in 1970.  
[nL1N1O022W]

The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is
still much higher than a year ago when only 477 rigs were active
after energy companies boosted spending plans for 2017 as crude
started recovering from a two-year price crash around the same
time OPEC agreed to production cuts a year ago.

The increase in U.S. drilling lasted 14 months before
stalling in August, September and October as some producers
started trimming their 2017 spending plans after prices turned
softer over the summer. Energy firms started adding rigs again
in November as crude prices rose.

U.S. crude futures  rose 5.5 percent in November amid
talk of extending the OPEC-led deal to cut global supply, and so
far in 2017 since the agreement kicked in, have averaged over
$50 a barrel, easily topping last year's $43.47 average.

This week, futures climbed over $58 a barrel, near their
highest since June 2015.

Looking ahead, futures were trading near $57 for calendar
2018  and $54 for calendar 2019 .

In anticipation of higher prices than in 2016, exploration
and production (E&P) companies increased their spending on U.S.
drilling and completions in 2017 by about 53 percent over 2016,
according to U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co.

In addition, Cowen said 14 of the 64 E&Ps they track have
already provided capital expenditure guidance for 2018
indicating a 9 percent increase in planned spending over 2017.

Cowen, which has its own U.S. rig count, said it expects a
gradual decline in rigs in the fourth quarter of 2017 and in 
2018.

There were 929 oil and natural gas rigs active on Dec. 1.
The average number of rigs in service so far in 2017 was 872.
That compares with 509 in 2016 and 978 in 2015. Most rigs
produce both oil and gas.
