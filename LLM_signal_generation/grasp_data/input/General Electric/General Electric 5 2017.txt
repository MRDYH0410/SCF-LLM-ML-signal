WASHINGTON, May 31 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump talked trade with Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc during a White House visit on Wednesday and welcomed the signing of business deals worth billions of dollars and the jobs they would create.

The U.S. Commerce Department announced 13 new transactions with Vietnam worth $8 billion, including $3 billion worth of U.S.-produced content that would support more than 23,000 American jobs.

These include deals for General Electric Co worth $5.58 billion for power generation, aircraft engines and services, its largest-ever combined sale in Vietnam.[nL1N1IX17J]

Caterpillar Inc and its dealer in Vietnam also agreed to provide generator management technology for more than 100 generators in Vietnam, the company said.

"They (Vietnam) just made a very large order in the United States - and we appreciate that - for many billions of dollars, which means jobs for the United States and great, great equipment for Vietnam," Trump told reporters at the White House.

The Commerce Department estimate of the deals was considerably less than the $15 billion figure given by Phuc during a speech at the Heritage Foundation, adding that most of the total involved the import of U.S. equipment.

Communist Vietnam has gone from being a Cold War enemy to an important partner for the United States in the Asia-Pacific, where both countries share concerns about China's rising power.

Phuc told Trump the relationship had undergone "significant upheavals in history" but that the two countries were now "comprehensive partners."

Phuc's meeting with Trump makes him the first Southeast Asian leader to visit the White House under the new administration.

TRADE FRICTION

However, while Hanoi and Washington have stepped up security cooperation in recent years, trade has become a potential irritant, with a deficit widening steadily in Vietnam's favor, reaching $32 billion last year, compared with $7 billion a decade earlier.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said it was important to shrink the U.S. trade deficit with Vietnam but noted that the southeast Asian country of 80 million people was the fastest-growing market for U.S. exports, rising 77 percent since 2014 to $4.4 billion.

"The growth of the middle class and the increasing purchasing power in Vietnam are further incentives to strengthening our long-term trade and investment relationship," Ross said.

Trump, who has had strong words for countries with large trade surpluses with the United States, said he would be discussing trade with Phuc, as well as North Korea.

Washington has been seeking support to pressure North Korea to drop its nuclear and missile programs, which have become an increasing threat to the United States. Hanoi has said it shares concerns about North Korea. [nL1N1I61WZ]

In his Heritage speech, Phuc welcomed Trump's plans to attend the November APEC summit in Hanoi. He called it a sign of U.S. commitment to the region and "an important occasion for the United States to assert its positive role."

In a reference to somewhat warmer ties between Washington and Beijing under Trump, who has been courting China's support on North Korea, Phuc said Vietnam welcomed good relations between the two powers, but hoped these would serve the interest of other nations in the region too.

He urged Washington and Beijing "to act with full transparency and in a responsible manner so as not to impact negatively the region and relations among other nations."

Vietnam's government said on its website Trump and Phuc had agreed to promote defense ties and discussed the possibility of U.S. vessels, including aircraft carriers, visiting Vietnamese ports.

It said they had expressed concern about the South China Sea, where Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei are involved in maritime disputes with China, which claims nearly all the strategic waterway. Taiwan also stakes a claim.

"They emphasized that parties must not take actions accelerating tension such as the militarization of disputed structures," it said, an apparent reference to China's construction work.

"NICE, BUT NOT ENOUGH"

Murray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that while the Trump administration welcomed new business deals with Vietnam, its view was they were "nice, but not enough."

"They want Vietnam to bring some ideas about how to tackle the surplus on an ongoing basis," he said.

On Tuesday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer expressed concern about the rapid growth of the deficit with Vietnam. He said it was a new challenge for the two countries and he was looking to Phuc to help address it. [nL1N1IX010]

The deficit is Washington's sixth largest and reflects growing imports of Vietnamese semiconductors and other electronics products in addition to more traditional sectors such as footwear, apparel and furniture.

On Tuesday Vietnam's trade minister, Tran Tuan Anh, presented Lighthizer with suggestions to address some U.S. concerns, such as advertising on U.S. social media, electronic payment services and imports of information security and farm products, Vietnam's trade ministry said.

Vietnam was disappointed when Trump ditched the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, of which Hanoi was expected to be one of the main beneficiaries, and focused U.S. trade policy on reducing deficits.

By David Lawder and Alwyn Scott

WASHINGTON/SEATTLE, May 31 (Reuters) - U.S. companies signed business deals with Vietnam worth over $8 billion on Wednesday, including power projects and jet engines from General Electric Co and diesel generator technology from Caterpillar , the Commerce Department said.

The 13 deals were announced as Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc met with U.S. President Donald Trump as part of a three-day, trade-focused trip to the United States.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who has pledged to shrink U.S. trade deficits, said the transactions would include $3.4 billion in U.S. produced content that would support 23,000 jobs.

But the Trump administration still wants more work from Vietnam to bring down a rapidly growing $32 billion trade surplus with the United States, said Murray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

"I heard from U.S. officials ahead of the trip that just signing deals with U.S. companies was nice but not enough," Hiebert said.

GE said on Wednesday it had signed deals in Vietnam worth about $5.58 billion for power generation, aircraft engines and services, its largest single combined sale with the country in GE's history.

GE's agreement with Vietjet Aviation JSC includes 20 jet engines made by CFM International, a joint venture of GE and Safran SA of France. It also includes a 12-year engine service contract for 215 LEAP-1B engines on 100 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft that Vietjet has ordered, GE said.

GE's power unit signed a memorandum of understanding to build two 750-megawatt gas fired turbine power plants in conjunction with state energy group PetroVietnam, using the Blue Whale gas field. [nL4N1F33WP]

GE also signed a joint development agreement to erect an 800-megawatt wind power facility. Partners in the agreement are Phu Cuong Group and International Mainstream Renewable Power, GE said.

Honeywell also signed a $100 million deal to supply VietJet with 98 auxiliary power units for the airline's new fleet of Airbus A320 aircraft, including maintenance for 12 years.

Caterpillar and its dealer in Vietnam, Phu Thai Cat, agreed to provide generator management technology for more than 100 generators in Vietnam, the company said. The technology would allow for remote function monitoring including fuel, temperature and pressure. The value of the Caterpillar deal was not disclosed.

Hilton Worldwide signed a deal worth $650 million to manage a 610-room dual-branded hotel in Vietnam, while port security firm Passport Systems Inc signed a deal worth $1 billion, with $420 million in U.S. content, Commerce said.

WASHINGTON, May 31 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump discussed trade with Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc during a White House visit on Wednesday and welcomed the signing of business deals worth billions of dollars and the jobs they would bring.

"They just made a very large order in the United States - and we appreciate that - for many billions of dollars, which means jobs for the United States and great, great equipment for Vietnam," Trump told reporters at the White House.

Phuc said on Tuesday he would sign deals for U.S. goods and services worth $15 billion to $17 billion during his Washington visit, mainly for high-technology products and for services. [nL1N1IX010]

Communist Vietnam has gone from being a bitter adversary of the United States during the Cold War to an important partner in the Asia-Pacific, where both countries share concerns about China's rising power.

Phuc told Trump the relationship had undergone "significant upheavals in history," but that the two countries were now "comprehensive partners."

However, while Hanoi and Washington have stepped up security cooperation in recent years, trade has become a potential irritant, with a deficit widening steadily in Vietnam's favor, reaching $32 billion last year, compared with $7 billion a decade earlier.

Analysts said that while the Trump administration welcomed new business deals with Vietnam, it wants to see moves on trade.

Murray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington said the view was that deals were "nice, but not enough."

"They want Vietnam to bring some ideas about how to tackle the surplus on an ongoing basis," he said.

Phuc's meeting with Trump makes him the first Southeast Asian leader to visit the White House under the new administration.

It reflected calls, letters, diplomatic contacts and lower-level visits that started long before Trump took office in Washington, where Vietnam retains a lobbyist at $30,000 a month.

GUIDE TO EU MERGER PROCESS

DEADLINES:

The European Commission has 25 working days after a deal is filed for a first-stage review. It may extend that by 10 working days to 35 working days, to consider either a company's proposed remedies or an EU member state's request to handle the case.

Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90 additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working days.

SIMPLIFIED:

Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved.

GE's Saudi joint venture to start gas turbine production this year - Reuters Gulf Financial News

{{20170525T081419.461+0000}}GE's Saudi joint venture to start gas turbine production this yearSAUDI-INDUSTRY/GE:GE's Saudi joint venture to start gas turbine production this year

DUBAI, May 25 (Reuters) - General Electric's joint venture to manufacture gas turbines in Saudi Arabia will start production by the end of the year, the chief executive of its state-backed Saudi partner said on Thursday.

GE and Saudi industrial development company Dussur signed an agreement on Wednesday to set up the one billion riyal ($267 million) joint venture in the eastern city of Dammam.

Dussur CEO Rasheed al-Shubaili said manufacturing of GE's H-Class turbines in Saudi Arabia would start before the end of the year with the first turbine to be completed in 2018.

The Saudi made gas turbines would be sold in the country and to international customers, he said in an interview in Dubai.

Dussur, formerly Saudi Arabian Industrial Investments Company (SAIIC), was established in 2016 by state firms Saudi Aramco, Public Investment Fund, Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC).

It aims to develop industrial sectors in Saudi Arabia as part of the government's plan to create jobs and diversify the oil-dependent economy.

The joint venture followed a memorandum of understanding signed last year by GE and Dussur that is expected to draw nearly 3.75 billion riyals of investment by the two companies in 2017.

Al-Shubaili declined to say when the joint venture, which is 55 percent owned by Dussur and 45 percent owned by GE, aimed to make a profit.

"We're a long-term patient investor. Our investments are going to profitable," al-Shubaili said.

GE and Dussur signed the joint venture agreement days after GE announced $15 billion of deals with Saudi Arabia during United State President Donald Trump's visit to the Kingdom last weekend.

REUTERS SUMMIT-Hungary to issue tender for nuclear plant turbines "very soon" - 路透新闻

{{20170524T163150.246+0000}}REUTERS SUMMIT-Hungary to issue tender for nuclear plant turbines "very soon"(For other news from Reuters Central & Eastern Europe Investment Summit, click on http://www.reuters.com/summit/CentralEasternEuropeInvestment17)

By Marton Dunai and Krisztina Than

BUDAPEST, May 24 (Reuters) - Russian nuclear group Rosatom unit JSC Atomstroyexport will soon issue the first major international tender for steam turbines at Hungary's new nuclear power plant, a top Hungarian government official said on Wednesday.

Hungary signed a deal with Russia to build two Russian VVER 1200 reactors for 12.5 billion euros ($13.97 billion), with 80 percent funded by a Russian loan and 20 percent by Hungary, which will own the plant in Paks, 100 km (60 miles) south of Budapest.

Environmental groups and Hungary's opposition criticised the government for what they said was the opaque way the contract was issued to Russia's state-owned nuclear giant in 2014.

After clearing a European Union probe on potential illegal state aid in March, construction work could begin in early 2018, Attila Aszodi, nominated as state secretary for the project, told the Reuters Central & Eastern Europe Investment Summit.

This preparation phase could cost 600-900 million euros over 12 months, he said, adding main costs would be incurred between 2021 and 2024 when the main reactor sites were built and machinery installed.

"I believe that in two years from now, if all conditions are right, then... the nuclear construction can begin," Aszodi said.

He said the first major international tender for the steam turbines could be issued "very soon", without giving a date.

"The Russian partner is committed to making this an international project," he said, adding that the turbine tender was expected to attract two or three bidders but other tenders would draw more interest.

Based on a similar project in Finland, General Electric Alstom, Siemens and Toshiba could bid to manufacture turbines, he said.

Hungary's Paks plant currently has four Russian-built VVER 440 reactors with a combined capacity of about 2,000 megawatts (MW), which will be decommissioned by 2037.

Aszodi said there will be no more than six years when the two new blocks and the old ones operate concurrently.

Maintaining nuclear capacity does not mean renewables did not have a place in Hungary's power system, he said.

He said nuclear power would cover about 40 percent of Hungary's power consumption until the end of the century. "So this cannot stop renewables entering," he said.

{{20170520T113000.835+0000}}GE announces $15 billion of business deals with Saudi ArabiaRIYADH, May 20 (Reuters) - U.S. technology and engineering conglomerate GE said on Saturday it had signed $15 billion of business deals with Saudi Arabia as part of the kingdom's drive to diversify its economy beyond oil.

It came as dozens of senior U.S. business executives met Saudi counterparts at a conference coinciding with the visit of President Donald Trump to Riyadh.

The agreements, which involve almost $7 billion of goods and services from GE itself, range from the power and healthcare sectors to the oil and gas industry and mining, GE said. Some of the deals are memorandums of understanding which would require further agreements to materialise.

Among the projects, GE will help make Saudi power generation more efficient and provide digital technology to the operations of oil firm Saudi Aramco, aiming to create $4 billion of annual productivity improvements at Aramco. It will cooperate in medical research and training.

REFILE-ANALYSIS-Old machines show why Trump tax breaks may not spark new company spending - 路透新闻

{{20170519T203944.088+0000}}REFILE-ANALYSIS-Old machines show why Trump tax breaks may not spark new company spending(Corrects weight of Arconic press)

By Timothy Aeppel

CLEVELAND, May 18 (Reuters) - Hanging on the wall of David Shippoli's office at a sprawling factory here is his company's annual scavenger award, a stuffed hyena head, given to the employee who finds the cheapest way to execute an investment project in the past year.

Shippoli, a manufacturing engineer at Dan T. Moore Co., a privately-held company which operates nine factories across Ohio and Indiana, won the prize for finding used machines that were a fraction of the cost of buying them new.

He is a fan of President Donald Trump's policies and even propped a bright red "Make America Great Again" hat on the hyena during the campaign. But Shippoli embodies a mindset that exists across industrial America that will make it hard to boost business investment, even if the corporate tax breaks floated recently by the Trump administration come through.

"I don't know why anyone would buy new equipment when there's so much stuff out there that's perfectly capable of doing the job," he said.

Many U.S. companies emerged from the last recession extremely wary of spending on buildings and expensive new equipment, unless it was sure the returns would justify it.

Trump Administration officials forecast torrid economic growth on the back of the windfall U.S. companies would get if Trump's plan to cut corporate tax rates and slash taxes on cash parked overseas became law. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House economic advisor Gary Cohn met on Wednesday with the full Senate Finance Committee about the administration's framework for tax reform.

CEOs certainly are enthusiastic about the prospect of tax reform. A recent survey by the Business Roundtable - a group representing major U.S. corporations - found more than eight out of ten said they thought tax reform would prompt companies to boost capital spending. Seventy-six percent said it would fuel hiring.

And some companies such as General Electric Co are making big bets that new digital systems will improve efficiency on factory floors. [nL1N1I41F9]

But it is unclear how they would use the extra cash if it doesn't lead to a jump in economic growth. Previous tax holidays aimed at getting companies to repatriate foreign savings have done little to boost investment in the U.S.

"Nobody builds a new factory unless they need the capacity" and tax breaks won't change that, said Susan Helper, an economist at Case Western Reserve University, who has studied how companies curbed their spending habits in recent years.

She notes that U.S. companies are sitting on plenty of cash - $1.8 trillion, according to Moody's Investors Service - so it is not that they lack resources, she says. What is missing is the kind of business opportunities that justify the spending.

ARCONIC'S 80 YEAR-OLD MACHINES

It's not just smaller companies and startups that appreciate age in some industrial machines.

Across town, for instance, at Arconic Inc's sprawling Cleveland Works, workers still use a 1930s metal press confiscated from Germany after World War II to stamp out aluminum parts. Arconic, based in New York, was created last year when Alcoa Inc split in two - creating Alcoa Corp and Arconic, which took the downstream aluminum processing business.

Arconic has plenty of other vintage machines, including an even larger 50,000 ton press in Cleveland built in the 1950s, which it recently spent $100 million completely renovating. The update included fixing metal parts that had begun to crack as well as new controls that made it more precise.

This new style of thrift is visible in the numbers. The average age of industrial equipment in the U.S. has gone up steadily over the last decade and now hovers at levels not seen since the 1940s. The average age of a machine is 10 years, according the Bureau o f Economic Analysis, well above the seven or eight-year range that was common during the 1960s and 1970s. For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2qWxnWz

The trend isn't limited to factory machines. The average age of information processing equipment used by businesses, which includes computers as well as communications devices, has drifted up steadily since the year 2000 and now stands at five years—the highest level since the dawn of the computer age.

"You have to be frugal to survive," said Steve Peplin, CEO of privately held Talan Products Inc., which sells about $40 million in building materials each year. When he needed a new press recently, he bought an used machine and sent it to a company that specializes in modernizing such equipment.

"It was literally rebuilt," he said. "It got new high-efficiency motors and all computer controls." The reason to go down that road was simple: The whole project cost about $1.5 million versus the $2.5 million he was quoted to buy a new machine.

BUYING USED

The big coup last year for Dan T. Moore's Shippoli was buying used machines from a factory in California that is allowing him to set up a new production line for $140,000 instead of the $3 million it would have cost new. The line will produce an insulated material the company forms into different shapes and aims to sell to carmakers and other large manufacturers.

Case Western's Helper said there's "good thrift and bad thrift." If companies refuse to invest in new capabilities or processes, that is bad because it holds back productivity gains. Good thrift, by contrast, is the growing recognition that existing industrial machines are often good enough to get the job done, so splurging on new equipment isn't necessary.

Dan Moore, the CEO of Shippoli's company, has made the former approach almost a cult at his operations.

One of his favorite sayings is that "steel doesn't know how old it is," meaning the basic components of many industrial machines remain useful for decades. The company will typically invest in new computer controls and other components to update the machines it buys. Not only does Moore reward people who find ways to use old machines to meet new needs, he has been known to demote managers who throw away machines that could be salvaged.

One recent day, he led the way through one of his favorite places: HGR Industrial Surplus, a sprawling warehouse that sells old machines on the gritty industrial east side of Cleveland.

"This is one of the secrets of how you can create new businesses in Cleveland," he said, walking past rows of hydraulic presses, some still smudged with oil from their previous life in a now-defunct factory.

It makes sense to use old machines to get new operations off the ground, because it minimizes the risk if the business doesn't take off, according to Moore.

For Windsor Ford, the company's vice-president of acquisitions, the idea of pitching a project to his CEO that involves buying new equipment isn't unheard of, but it's "terrifying."

"All I can say is you better have data to back it up," he said.

CORRECTED-General Electric to launch service plant for power turbines in Nigeria - 路透新闻

{{20170519T110001.334+0000}}CORRECTED-General Electric to launch service plant for power turbines in Nigeria(In MAY 18 story, corrects to make clear the multi-use facility will service power turbines not assemble gas turbines)

By Oludare Mayowa

LAGOS, May 18 (Reuters) - General Electric (GE) plans to launch a repair and service plant for power turbines and has invested over $100 million, its local CEO said, as it seeks to tap growing demand for gas-fired power plants in Africa's biggest economy.

Lazarus Angbazo said the GE plant would be a multi-use facility to support its clients in the power, oil and gas sector, adding that the U.S. company has invested in some local power plants.

Nigeria privatised its electricity sector in 2013, aiming to end decades of blackouts which have hampered economic growth. Most of the plants it sold were gas-fired, operating below capacity due to inadequate gas supply.

Officials say demand for gas in Nigeria is estimated to rise to 3 billion standard cubic feet (scuf) per day by 2017 from 1.2 billion scuf per day in 2015, ten times the 300 million of eight years ago.

OPEC member Nigeria has the world's ninth largest proven gas reserves at 187 trillion scuf. Last month state-oil firm NNPC said it wanted to more than triple gas supply for local use by 2020. [nL8N1IB7XO]

Angbazo said construction work on the plant which is located in the southeastern Nigerian city of Calabar is expected to be completed in December. Operations will start in the first quarter, the company told Reuters by email.

GE has made a bid for a $2 billion railway project to connect Nigeria's northern cities to the south of the country and could expand its plant to include locomotive assembly. [nL8N1IC6GX]

UPDATE 1-Saudi Aramco to sign deals with U.S. firms during Trump visit - sources - 路透新闻

{{20170518T173821.095+0000}}UPDATE 1-Saudi Aramco to sign deals with U.S. firms during Trump visit - sources(Adds response from companies and GE MOUs)

JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia, May 18 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco [IPO-ARMO.SE] is due to sign deals with 12 U.S. companies on Saturday during U.S. President Donald Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, sources with knowledge of the matter said.

The deals with top U.S. companies such as oilfield services firms Schlumberger , Halliburton , Baker Hughes , and Weatherford are part of the oil giant's push to develop local manufacturing, the sources said.

Aramco will also sign deals with General Electric (GE) and drilling companies National Oilwell Varco (NOV), Nabors Industries and Rowan Companies , among others, they added.

Aramco could not be reached for comment on Thursday.

Halliburton's incoming chief executive, Jeff Miller, declined to comment on any potential deal with Saudi Aramco. Baker Hughes also declined to comment.

When it launched its In-Kingdom Total Value Add programme (IKTVA) in 2015, Aramco said it aimed to double the percentage of locally-produced energy-related goods and services to 70 percent by 2021

U.S. companies have traditionally worked with Aramco on massive projects covering consultancy and project management services to maintaining oil potential in upstream projects and drilling to building refineries.

"These (new) partnerships will boost bilateral investment towards localisation," said one of the sources.

Last December, Aramco signed deals with drilling firms Rowan and Nabors Industries to establish joint ventures under the IKTVA programme. [ID:nL5N1EA2Z4]

IKTVA, Arabic for self-sufficiency, will help generate 500,000 direct and indirect jobs for Saudis. It is a key part of the kingdom's Vision 2030 economic reform drive, in which Aramco is to play a big role in developing industrial projects as Saudi Arabia tries to diversify its economy beyond reliance on oil exports.

GE plans to sign memoranda of understanding on oil services, digital and the IKTVA initiative, said one source close to the matter.

Engineering companies KBR and Jacobs Engineering , as well as McDermott and Honeywell will also sign memoranda of understanding with Aramco, the sources said.

An inaugural Saudi-U.S. CEO forum will be held in Riyadh on Saturday in which several deals are expected to be signed in defence, electricity, oil and gas, industrial and chemical sectors. New licences for U.S. companies to operate in the kingdom also will be issued. [nL8N1II6DW]

U.S. companies push hard for lower tax rate on offshore profits - 路透新闻

{{20170515T100001.886+0000}}U.S. companies push hard for lower tax rate on offshore profitsBy Ginger Gibson

WASHINGTON, May 15 (Reuters) - Major U.S. multinationals are pushing the Trump administration to deepen the tax break it has already tentatively proposed on $2.6 trillion in corporate profits being held offshore, a key piece in Washington's intricate tax reform puzzle.

As President Donald Trump tries to deliver on his campaign promise to overhaul the tax code, lobbyists for technology, drug and other manufacturers are working with officials behind closed doors, six lobbyists working with various industries told Reuters.

In line with tax cuts already embraced by Republicans in the House of Representatives, the lobbyists said they are telling the White House and Treasury Department that if companies are forced to bring home, or repatriate, foreign earnings, they want a sharply reduced tax rate.

The lobbyists are making an aggressive case that cutting the tax rate on offshore profits to 10 percent from 35 percent, as the administration has indicated it may favor, is not enough.

Rather, the lobbyists said they want a lower, bifurcated rate of 3.5 percent on earnings already invested abroad in illiquid assets, such as factories, and 8.75 percent on cash and liquid assets.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump proposed setting the rate at 10 percent, and argued it could be used to raise tax revenue to pay for tax cuts or infrastructure.

Discussion of hard numbers in the long-running repatriation debate may indicate tax reform is advancing on Trump's slow-moving domestic policy agenda. Or it may just be lobbyists trying to set the early framework for a long slog ahead, which could be adjusted if they get concessions elsewhere.

"For us, it's how you create a tax environment where you give business long-term certainty," one lobbyist said.

The changes being discussed are part of larger tax reform, another lobbyist said: "Our international tax system is out of whack with the rest of the world. This system is not sustainable."

LATEST PUSH IN LONG CAMPAIGN

The lobbyists' demands represent the latest effort in a push by corporate America that has been under way since 2004-2005, the last time Washington let multinationals pay only a small fraction of the taxes due on their foreign profits.

Repatriation and comprehensive tax reform are important to the economy, Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month on CNBC. "The administration ... they're really getting this and want to bring this back and I hope that that comes to pass," he said. Apple held $239.6 billion of cash and securities offshore as of April 1.

Under current law, U.S.-based corporations are supposed to pay 35-percent income tax on profits worldwide. But companies can defer that tax on active profits left outside the country.

The deferral rule has incentivized multinationals to park profits offshore and about $2.6 trillion in earnings is being held overseas by more than 500 U.S. companies, according to Audit Analytics, a corporate research firm.

Nearly a third of that is held by 10 companies, including Apple, Microsoft Corp , Pfizer Inc and General Electric Co , the firm said. All four of those companies declined to comment.

These companies and hundreds of others could bring their foreign profits into the United States at any time, but they do not in order to avoid paying the 35-percent tax due.

If the $2.6 trillion overseas were repatriated at once, two things would happen. First, Washington would get a big jolt of tax revenue. Second, repatriated profits not collected by the Internal Revenue Service could be put to use in the economy.

As the law stands, tax-deferred profits can be held offshore indefinitely. The result of that has been companies biding their time, claiming their profits are "trapped" offshore while lobbying for a repatriation tax cut. The last time they got one was in 2004-2005 under former President George W. Bush, whose administration let multinationals voluntarily repatriate profits at a 5.25 percent tax rate.

At the time, Bush tried to extract promises from companies that they would dedicate repatriated funds to investments in new plants and other job-creating projects.

But in a 2011 follow-up study, a Senate committee concluded the Bush repatriation tax "holiday" cost the Treasury at least $3.3 billion in net revenue over 10 years and "produced no appreciable increase in U.S. jobs or domestic investment."

Rather, the repatriated funds largely went to shareholder dividends and executive bonuses, the committee said.

The repatriation tax break now being discussed differs from Bush's: repatriation would not be voluntary, but mandatory, so foreign profits would have to be brought home.

In addition, lobbyists said they have talked to the administration about ending deferral and exempting foreign profits from taxation. The administration has floated this as an option. Lobbyists said there has been discussion about limiting that exemption to 95 percent of repatriated foreign earnings.

Australian gas squeeze bolsters Chinese turbine maker's southern push - 路透新闻

{{20170515T082347.479+0000}}Australian gas squeeze bolsters Chinese turbine maker's southern pushBy Sonali Paul

MELBOURNE, May 15 (Reuters) - Australia's soaring natural gas prices are driving up power tariffs on the world's smallest continent, boosting prospects for China's biggest wind turbine maker, which is already set to buy the biggest wind farm project in the southern hemisphere.

Goldwind Australia - the local unit of Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co <002202.SZ> - beat at least 10 rivals for the purchase of the site and permits to build the 530 megawatt (MW) Stockyard Hill project, sold last week by Origin Energy for A$110 million ($81 million).

Goldwind Australia's managing director, John Titchen, declined to say how much the whole project would cost, but he expects it to take around two years to build. The Chinese company has said it would spend a further A$335 million and borrow more funds on top of that to complete the wind farm.

Origin will buy all of the electricity generated from the Victoria state project - enough to power 400,000 homes - and the associated renewable energy certificates for a record low price in Australia of less than A$60 per megawatt hour (Mwh).

The price was achievable thanks to the scale of the wind farm, the capacity of Goldwind's new turbines and the location, Titchen said in an interview.

"It's the biggest wind farm in Australia, so it's at the most attractive end of the spectrum," he told Reuters.

The power price is well below a deal by Origin's rival AGL Energy , which in January agreed to buy all the electricity from another, smaller wind farm for A$65 per Mwh.

While costs are coming down for wind and solar power relative to coal, Titchen said a key factor that has made renewable energy more competitive in Australia is a sharp rise in natural gas prices.

"The tightening of the gas market, the high prices of gas, have had some significant impact on (electricity) market prices," Titchen said.

Average wholesale power prices in the state of Victoria have doubled over the past two years to more than A$60/Mwh, while prices in neighbouring New South Wales have soared from A$35 to around A$80 over the same period.

"That's made it clear that renewable energy contributions will help in terms of providing competitive cost of supply for Australian customers," Titchen said.

Goldwind, the world's third-largest wind turbine maker behind Denmark's Vestas Wind Systems and General Electric Co in 2016, already runs two wind farms in Australia and is set to start a third next month.

It has plans for three other projects in Australia besides Stockyard Hill, and is working on adding solar power at two of its wind farms to get more value out of infrastructure such grid connections, Titchen said.

UPDATE 3-In blow to Trump, GE backs NAFTA and voices support for Mexico - 路透新闻

{{20170512T223626.746+0000}}UPDATE 3-In blow to Trump, GE backs NAFTA and voices support for Mexico(New throughout, adds details and comments from GE executives)

By Dave Graham

MONTERREY, Mexico, May 12 (Reuters) - General Electric on Friday praised Mexico as a big part of its future and said the company is "very supportive" of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that U.S President Donald Trump has threatened to ditch.

GE Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt said on a visit that Mexico had great potential and was not properly understood. He touted the conglomerate's Mexican operations and the trade deal binding Mexico, Canada and the United States.

"GE as a company, we're very supportive of NAFTA," Immelt told employees at an event to mark the expansion of operations in the northern city of Monterrey. He said the trade accord could be modernized, as Mexico has argued.

Immelt sits on a Trump-appointed manufacturing council that Mexico has targeted for lobbying as Mexico and Canada push U.S. business leaders to defend NAFTA.

The GE boss said trade meant "win-win" opportunities across North America. [nL1N1I602N]

"We will continue to work constructively in the context of wanting to see a close relationship between the U.S. and Mexico," he said, noting that GE's exports to the rest of the world from Mexico were worth $3 billion.

"We're optimistic about Mexico, we're optimistic about what we can do here," Immelt added, saying Latin America's no. 2 economy would be a "big part" of GE's future.

Earlier this month, Immelt urged the Trump administration to avoid protectionist policies, calling on it to level the playing field for U.S. companies with tax reform, revived export financing and improved trade agreements. [nL1N1I701C]

Trump touts a "Buy American" policy and has railed against U.S. companies moving operations to Mexico. He has threatened to ditch NAFTA, a lynchpin of the Mexican economy, if he cannot rework it to secure better terms for the United States.

Unlike some U.S. companies, GE has not backed off plans in Mexico, risking broadsides from Trump on Twitter.

Earlier, the Mexican presidency said in a statement that GE had stated an interest in doubling purchases from Mexican suppliers next year. Immelt did not mention this.

Vladimiro de la Mora, CEO for Mexico, said the figure came from an announcement last year and did not mean GE aimed to double purchases between this year and 2018.

On Thursday, GE said it had won a contract to provide plants producing two new gigawatts of power in Mexico and secured a separate $120 million, multi-year service deal. [nL1N1IE019]

De la Mora said GE could not yet reveal details of the 2 GW deal, but it was "likely" the value of the total investment in the power plants would exceed $500 million.

UPDATE 2-Boeing resumes 737 MAX test flights after brief grounding - 路透新闻

{{20170512T204614.268+0000}}UPDATE 2-Boeing resumes 737 MAX test flights after brief grounding(Adds details)

By Alwyn Scott

May 12 (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Friday it resumed test flights of its $110-million 737 MAX 8 jetliner, just two days after saying it had grounded the entire fleet to address an engine problem.

The resumption of flights, which the plane maker said was backed by air safety regulators, is good news for Boeing and engine-maker CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric Co and Safran SA of France.

CFM had said flaws in the forging of a disc inside the engine could have led to cracks.

Boeing grounded the fleet late last week, and announced it on Wednesday, just days before it planned to deliver its first 737 MAX 8 to an airline.

Inability to fly the plane could have threatened Boeing's ability to deliver the new jetliners on time.

The company said a 737 MAX 8 took off around 12:15 pm Pacific Time on Friday.

Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said regulators supported the resumption of flights.

"Our plan remains to start deliveries this month," he said, noting the flights are with planes that do not have the suspect discs.

Alder declined to say when the inspection and possible repair of any engines with the suspect discs would be complete.

The engines, known as the LEAP-1B, were being shipped back to plants in Lafayette, Indiana, and Villeroche, France, for inspection.

Safran Aircraft Engines Chief Executive Olivier Andries told reporters on Thursday that the company hoped to fix the problem "within a few weeks."

Alder also declined to estimate the potential cost, or say whether any faulty discs had been found so far.

The problem stemmed from a forging issue noticed on low-pressure turbine discs after they were sent to CFM from a supplier. A second supplier had stepped up production, CFM said.

Andries said on Thursday that CFM still hoped to deliver as many as 500 LEAP engines this year, including variants used by Airbus And China's COMAC.

GE's Immelt wants to double purchases from Mexico: nation's president  - 路透新闻

{{20170512T155035.741+0000}}GE's Immelt wants to double purchases from Mexico: nation's president MEXICO CITY, May 12 (Reuters) - General Electric Co Chief Executive Jeff Immelt expressed interest on Friday in doubling the U.S. conglomerate's purchases from Mexican suppliers next year, the Mexican president's office said in a statement.

Immelt met with Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico City on Friday, starting a trip in the country that will last several days, at a time of tension between the two countries over U.S President Donald Trump's efforts to move jobs north of the border.

"Immelt ratified the company's confidence in Mexico and its national industry, by expressing his interest in doubling purchases from national suppliers in 2018," the president's office said in a statement.

UPDATE 3-In blow to Trump, GE backs NAFTA and voices support for Mexico - 路透新闻

{{20170512T223626.746+0000}}UPDATE 3-In blow to Trump, GE backs NAFTA and voices support for Mexico(New throughout, adds details and comments from GE executives)

By Dave Graham

MONTERREY, Mexico, May 12 (Reuters) - General Electric on Friday praised Mexico as a big part of its future and said the company is "very supportive" of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that U.S President Donald Trump has threatened to ditch.

GE Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt said on a visit that Mexico had great potential and was not properly understood. He touted the conglomerate's Mexican operations and the trade deal binding Mexico, Canada and the United States.

"GE as a company, we're very supportive of NAFTA," Immelt told employees at an event to mark the expansion of operations in the northern city of Monterrey. He said the trade accord could be modernized, as Mexico has argued.

Immelt sits on a Trump-appointed manufacturing council that Mexico has targeted for lobbying as Mexico and Canada push U.S. business leaders to defend NAFTA.

The GE boss said trade meant "win-win" opportunities across North America. [nL1N1I602N]

"We will continue to work constructively in the context of wanting to see a close relationship between the U.S. and Mexico," he said, noting that GE's exports to the rest of the world from Mexico were worth $3 billion.

"We're optimistic about Mexico, we're optimistic about what we can do here," Immelt added, saying Latin America's no. 2 economy would be a "big part" of GE's future.

Earlier this month, Immelt urged the Trump administration to avoid protectionist policies, calling on it to level the playing field for U.S. companies with tax reform, revived export financing and improved trade agreements. [nL1N1I701C]

Trump touts a "Buy American" policy and has railed against U.S. companies moving operations to Mexico. He has threatened to ditch NAFTA, a lynchpin of the Mexican economy, if he cannot rework it to secure better terms for the United States.

Unlike some U.S. companies, GE has not backed off plans in Mexico, risking broadsides from Trump on Twitter.

Earlier, the Mexican presidency said in a statement that GE had stated an interest in doubling purchases from Mexican suppliers next year. Immelt did not mention this.

Vladimiro de la Mora, CEO for Mexico, said the figure came from an announcement last year and did not mean GE aimed to double purchases between this year and 2018.

On Thursday, GE said it had won a contract to provide plants producing two new gigawatts of power in Mexico and secured a separate $120 million, multi-year service deal. [nL1N1IE019]

De la Mora said GE could not yet reveal details of the 2 GW deal, but it was "likely" the value of the total investment in the power plants would exceed $500 million.

UPDATE 2-Boeing resumes 737 MAX test flights after brief grounding - 路透新闻

{{20170512T204614.268+0000}}UPDATE 2-Boeing resumes 737 MAX test flights after brief grounding(Adds details)

By Alwyn Scott

May 12 (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Friday it resumed test flights of its $110-million 737 MAX 8 jetliner, just two days after saying it had grounded the entire fleet to address an engine problem.

The resumption of flights, which the plane maker said was backed by air safety regulators, is good news for Boeing and engine-maker CFM International, a joint venture between General Electric Co and Safran SA of France.

CFM had said flaws in the forging of a disc inside the engine could have led to cracks.

Boeing grounded the fleet late last week, and announced it on Wednesday, just days before it planned to deliver its first 737 MAX 8 to an airline.

Inability to fly the plane could have threatened Boeing's ability to deliver the new jetliners on time.

The company said a 737 MAX 8 took off around 12:15 pm Pacific Time on Friday.

Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said regulators supported the resumption of flights.

"Our plan remains to start deliveries this month," he said, noting the flights are with planes that do not have the suspect discs.

Alder declined to say when the inspection and possible repair of any engines with the suspect discs would be complete.

The engines, known as the LEAP-1B, were being shipped back to plants in Lafayette, Indiana, and Villeroche, France, for inspection.

Safran Aircraft Engines Chief Executive Olivier Andries told reporters on Thursday that the company hoped to fix the problem "within a few weeks."

Alder also declined to estimate the potential cost, or say whether any faulty discs had been found so far.

The problem stemmed from a forging issue noticed on low-pressure turbine discs after they were sent to CFM from a supplier. A second supplier had stepped up production, CFM said.

Andries said on Thursday that CFM still hoped to deliver as many as 500 LEAP engines this year, including variants used by Airbus And China's COMAC.

GE's Immelt wants to double purchases from Mexico: nation's president  - 路透新闻

{{20170512T155035.741+0000}}GE's Immelt wants to double purchases from Mexico: nation's president MEXICO CITY, May 12 (Reuters) - General Electric Co Chief Executive Jeff Immelt expressed interest on Friday in doubling the U.S. conglomerate's purchases from Mexican suppliers next year, the Mexican president's office said in a statement.

Immelt met with Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico City on Friday, starting a trip in the country that will last several days, at a time of tension between the two countries over U.S President Donald Trump's efforts to move jobs north of the border.

"Immelt ratified the company's confidence in Mexico and its national industry, by expressing his interest in doubling purchases from national suppliers in 2018," the president's office said in a statement.

CFM says Boeing has engines for 737 MAX that are cleared to fly - 路透新闻

{{20170511T170018.624+0000}}CFM says Boeing has engines for 737 MAX that are cleared to flySEATTLE, May 11 (Reuters) - Aircraft engine maker CFM International said on Thursday that Boeing Co has engines in stock for its grounded 737 MAX that are cleared to fly.

The engines could be installed in short order to allow Boeing to meet its schedule for delivering the first 737 MAX aircraft this month, CFM spokeswoman Jamie Jewell told Reuters. Boeing said on Wednesday it had suspended flights of the new jet due to a quality issue with some engines made by CFM, a joint venture between General Electric Co and Safran SA of France.

UPDATE 2-Safran begins Boeing engine checks, shares fall - 路透新闻

{{20170511T161138.414+0000}}UPDATE 2-Safran begins Boeing engine checks, shares fall* Safran expects to complete inspections within weeks

* CFM aims to deliver as close as possible to 500 LEAP engines

* Safran shares down 2.2 pct

(Adds quotes, background, updates shares)

By Tim Hepher and Cyril Altmeyer

VILLAROCHE, France, May 11 (Reuters) - France's Safran said inspections of new-generation LEAP engines supplied to Boeing for the latest version of its 737 aircraft are expected to be completed within a few weeks and ruled out a design fault as the cause of problems that halted test flights.

The French engine maker is scrambling to transport dozens of engine turbines back from the United States, only days before Boeing had been due to start deliveries of the new 737 MAX.

Boeing said on Wednesday that it was suspending 737 MAX test flights while CFM International, an engine venture co-owned by Safran and General Electric , conducted checks after a quality problem was found in a turbine disc.[nL1N1IC1OA]

The problem is not related to the part's design and does not suggest deeper problems in the industry's tightly stretched supply chain, Safran Aircraft Engines' Chief Executive Olivier Andries told reporters.

"There will be a temporary disruption to the logistics, which we hope to fix within a few weeks," said Andries at a French factory where production is being ramped up to meet demand for the LEAP engine. A similar factory is based in Ohio.

The LEAP-1B engine is produced for Boeing. A LEAP-1A model made for Airbus A320neo jets is not affected, Andries said.

CFM's shareholders said last month that between 450 and 500 LEAP engines are expected to be delivered this year rather than the previously stated 500.

Andries said production of engines would not be affected because a second supplier for the same part was boosting its supplies. CFM aims to deliver "as close as possible to 500" in total for Boeing, Airbus and China's COMAC, he said.

Still, Safran's share price was dented by the renewed focus on ambitious production schedules that had previously suffered barely a glitch.

EXECUTION RISK

"Late-stage discoveries occur on many new aircraft and engine programmes, and the cost impact historically has tended to be low to immaterial in our experience," said Harry Breach, analyst at wealth management firm Raymond James.

"Nonetheless, this incident highlights execution risk on the key LEAP programme."

Shares in Safran, which is aiming to complete a merger with parts maker Zodiac Aerospace , fell 2.2 percent to 75.82 euros by the close, among the worst performers on a CAC-40 index <.FCHI> down 0.3 percent.

The head of Malaysia Airlines, which has ordered 25 Boeing 737 MAX jets, said he was not worried about the engine snag. The first 737 MAX was due to be delivered next week to smaller Indonesian-owned Malaysian carrier Malindo Air.

"I don't see it affecting at all the introduction of the aircraft," Malaysia Airlines chief Peter Bellew told Reuters on the sidelines of a CAPA airline conference in Dublin.

Despite the setback on the eve of Boeing's first delivery, Safran said it had overtaken rival Pratt & Whitney as the engine supplier for most Airbus A320neo-family jets now in service and outlined new production techniques designed to speed output.

Pratt & Whitney has had a spate of problems with its new Geared Turbofan engine but says fixes are on the way.

Safran executive says Boeing LEAP engine problem not design issue - 路透新闻

{{20170511T094329.694+0000}}Safran executive says Boeing LEAP engine problem not design issueVILLAROCHE, France, May 11 (Reuters) - The head of Safran's aircraft engines division said on Thursday that an engine problem with a Boeing plane was not a design issue, and that an Airbus plane using a different version of that engine was not affected.

Boeing said on Wednesday it had halted test flights of its new 737 MAX aircraft due to an issue with the engine, made by Safran-GE joint-venture CFM International. Boeing uses a version of the engine called LEAP-1B. [nL1N1IC1OA]

Speaking at a factory outside Paris where it co-produces the engines with General Electric , Safran Aircraft Engines Chief Executive Olivier Andries said his company hoped to fix the glitch "within a few weeks."

"It is not a design problem but a problem regarding the quality of the production," said Andries. "The LEAP-1A engine is not affected," he added.

CFM's shareholders said last month they expected to deliver 450 to 500 LEAP engines this year instead of 500 stated earlier, although Andries said CFM still aimed to deliver as near as possible to 500 of those engines this year.

Boeing's test flight suspension comes days before it was due to deliver its first 737 MAX to Malaysia's Malindo Air.

Airbus, which offers a larger version called LEAP-1A on its new A320neo aircraft family, said on Wednesday it continued to conduct normal test flights and was unaffected.

However, it continues to experience delays in deliveries of the other choice of engine for that type of aircraft, the Geared Turbofan made by Pratt & Whitney .

By Alwyn Scott

SEATTLE, May 10 (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Wednesday it had temporarily halted test flights of its new 737 MAX aircraft due to an issue with the engine, which is jointly made by General Electric Co and Safran SA of France.

The grounding comes days before Boeing was due to deliver its first 737 MAX to an airline and marks a high-profile delay in a program that Boeing had said was ahead of schedule.

It poses no safety concerns for travelers because no airlines are yet flying the 737 MAX but it could mean a costly disruption if the problem persists. Timely delivery is important to planemakers as they get most of the payment for a plane when it is handed to the buyer.

Boeing and engine maker CFM said they do not know how long the delay will last.

Boeing shares fell 1.3 percent to $183.15 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. GE shares were down 0.9 percent at $28.67.

The 737 MAX replaces an older version of Boeing's best-selling single-aisle aircraft, a key moneymaker for the aerospace company. The 737 MAX 8, the first version of the plane to be built, seats 162 passengers in a typical two-class configuration. It carries a list price of $110 million but airlines typically receive steep discounts.

A delay in getting aircraft to customers likely would cause a build up in Boeing's inventory, "as planes essentially sit waiting for engines," said analyst Rob Stallard at Vertical Research Partners.

"Investors are acutely focused" on the risks of speeding up production of the new engine, known as the LEAP-1B, he said.

Separately, Airbus said it was continuing flights with its A320neo, which is powered by the similar LEAP-1A engine and is flying customers. [nL8N1IC89K]

The 737 MAX grounding likely will mean a delay for Malindo Air, a Malaysian carrier that had been expected to receive the first 737 MAX delivery as early as Monday. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA , which was due to receive its first 737 MAX near the end of May, said it expected a "a few days' delay."

"This will, however, not delay the launch of our upcoming trans-Atlantic routes from the United States to Edinburgh," spokesman Anders Lindstrom said in an email.

Southwest Airlines Co , the initial customer for the 737 MAX, said Boeing had not warned it of any delays to its delivery schedule. Southwest is expected to begin receiving the jet later in the year after it retires some older 737s.

American Airlines Group Inc , which has 100 737 MAX jets on order, declined to comment.

The issue arose late last week when Safran found a quality problem in a large metal disc used in the low-pressure turbine at the rear of the engine, said Jamie Jewell, a spokesman for the engine maker, CFM International.

CFM notified Boeing, which immediately grounded the fleet of about 21 planes. GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said the disc that prompted the concern had not been installed in an engine.

"There have been no issues whatsoever with engines in the field," Jewell said.

All of the 30 to 40 engines that have been built so far will be sent either to Lafayette, Indiana, or Villaroche, France, for inspection, Kennedy said. Many will need to be removed from aircraft and shipped, Jewell said.

It was not clear how long the inspections would take to complete. Safran received the disc from a supplier but there are other suppliers of that part so production of the engine was continuing, Kennedy said.

The European planemaker uses a different version of the engine from those supplied to Boeing, which said earlier it had halted test flights on its 737 MAX due to an engine issue.

Asked whether Airbus continued to carry out development test flights and pre-delivery test flights on A320neo-family aircraft powered by the LEAP-1A engine, made by GE-Safran venture CFM International, a spokesman for the planemaker said "yes we are".

GE said earlier Safran had found a quality problem in a disc used in the low-pressure turbine at the rear of the LEAP-1B engine used by Boeing and notified the jetmaker over the weekend [nL1N1IC1OA]. Safran was not immediately available for comment.

UPDATE 1-Nigeria to start General Electric railway talks -minister - 路透新闻

{{20170510T145931.114+0000}}UPDATE 1-Nigeria to start General Electric railway talks -minister(Adds detail, background)

ABUJA, May 10 (Reuters) - Nigeria will enter negotiations with General Electric (GE) over a railway project in the West African country, transport minister Rotimi Amaechi said on Wednesday.

Economic growth in Africa's most populous nation has been hampered for decades by its dilapidated rail network, built mainly by British colonial rulers before independence in 1960.

U.S. company GE had submitted the only bid for the $2 billion project connecting northern cities to the south of the country, according to a procurement process adviser, doing so in partnership with Transnet [CGETR.UL] of South Africa, Dutch-based APM Terminals and China's Sinohydro Consortium. [nL5N1H676R]

"Cabinet has approved that we commence negotiations," Amaechi told reporters after a cabinet meeting.

The concession will cover about 3,500 km (2,200 miles) of existing narrow-gauge lines from the southwestern commercial capital Lagos to Kano in the north and from southeastern oil hub Port Harcourt to Maiduguri in the northeast.

Nigeria's upper chamber of parliament, the Senate, said in November that it would investigate the railway concession over possible violations by Nigerian officials. [nL8N1D97GZ]

CFM says Boeing has engines for 737 MAX that are cleared to fly - 路透新闻

{{20170511T170018.624+0000}}CFM says Boeing has engines for 737 MAX that are cleared to flySEATTLE, May 11 (Reuters) - Aircraft engine maker CFM International said on Thursday that Boeing Co has engines in stock for its grounded 737 MAX that are cleared to fly.

The engines could be installed in short order to allow Boeing to meet its schedule for delivering the first 737 MAX aircraft this month, CFM spokeswoman Jamie Jewell told Reuters. Boeing said on Wednesday it had suspended flights of the new jet due to a quality issue with some engines made by CFM, a joint venture between General Electric Co and Safran SA of France.

UPDATE 2-Safran begins Boeing engine checks, shares fall - 路透新闻

{{20170511T161138.414+0000}}UPDATE 2-Safran begins Boeing engine checks, shares fall* Safran expects to complete inspections within weeks

* CFM aims to deliver as close as possible to 500 LEAP engines

* Safran shares down 2.2 pct

(Adds quotes, background, updates shares)

By Tim Hepher and Cyril Altmeyer

VILLAROCHE, France, May 11 (Reuters) - France's Safran said inspections of new-generation LEAP engines supplied to Boeing for the latest version of its 737 aircraft are expected to be completed within a few weeks and ruled out a design fault as the cause of problems that halted test flights.

The French engine maker is scrambling to transport dozens of engine turbines back from the United States, only days before Boeing had been due to start deliveries of the new 737 MAX.

Boeing said on Wednesday that it was suspending 737 MAX test flights while CFM International, an engine venture co-owned by Safran and General Electric , conducted checks after a quality problem was found in a turbine disc.[nL1N1IC1OA]

The problem is not related to the part's design and does not suggest deeper problems in the industry's tightly stretched supply chain, Safran Aircraft Engines' Chief Executive Olivier Andries told reporters.

"There will be a temporary disruption to the logistics, which we hope to fix within a few weeks," said Andries at a French factory where production is being ramped up to meet demand for the LEAP engine. A similar factory is based in Ohio.

The LEAP-1B engine is produced for Boeing. A LEAP-1A model made for Airbus A320neo jets is not affected, Andries said.

CFM's shareholders said last month that between 450 and 500 LEAP engines are expected to be delivered this year rather than the previously stated 500.

Andries said production of engines would not be affected because a second supplier for the same part was boosting its supplies. CFM aims to deliver "as close as possible to 500" in total for Boeing, Airbus and China's COMAC, he said.

Still, Safran's share price was dented by the renewed focus on ambitious production schedules that had previously suffered barely a glitch.

EXECUTION RISK

"Late-stage discoveries occur on many new aircraft and engine programmes, and the cost impact historically has tended to be low to immaterial in our experience," said Harry Breach, analyst at wealth management firm Raymond James.

"Nonetheless, this incident highlights execution risk on the key LEAP programme."

Shares in Safran, which is aiming to complete a merger with parts maker Zodiac Aerospace , fell 2.2 percent to 75.82 euros by the close, among the worst performers on a CAC-40 index <.FCHI> down 0.3 percent.

The head of Malaysia Airlines, which has ordered 25 Boeing 737 MAX jets, said he was not worried about the engine snag. The first 737 MAX was due to be delivered next week to smaller Indonesian-owned Malaysian carrier Malindo Air.

"I don't see it affecting at all the introduction of the aircraft," Malaysia Airlines chief Peter Bellew told Reuters on the sidelines of a CAPA airline conference in Dublin.

Despite the setback on the eve of Boeing's first delivery, Safran said it had overtaken rival Pratt & Whitney as the engine supplier for most Airbus A320neo-family jets now in service and outlined new production techniques designed to speed output.

Pratt & Whitney has had a spate of problems with its new Geared Turbofan engine but says fixes are on the way.

Safran executive says Boeing LEAP engine problem not design issue - 路透新闻

{{20170511T094329.694+0000}}Safran executive says Boeing LEAP engine problem not design issueVILLAROCHE, France, May 11 (Reuters) - The head of Safran's aircraft engines division said on Thursday that an engine problem with a Boeing plane was not a design issue, and that an Airbus plane using a different version of that engine was not affected.

Boeing said on Wednesday it had halted test flights of its new 737 MAX aircraft due to an issue with the engine, made by Safran-GE joint-venture CFM International. Boeing uses a version of the engine called LEAP-1B. [nL1N1IC1OA]

Speaking at a factory outside Paris where it co-produces the engines with General Electric , Safran Aircraft Engines Chief Executive Olivier Andries said his company hoped to fix the glitch "within a few weeks."

"It is not a design problem but a problem regarding the quality of the production," said Andries. "The LEAP-1A engine is not affected," he added.

CFM's shareholders said last month they expected to deliver 450 to 500 LEAP engines this year instead of 500 stated earlier, although Andries said CFM still aimed to deliver as near as possible to 500 of those engines this year.

Boeing's test flight suspension comes days before it was due to deliver its first 737 MAX to Malaysia's Malindo Air.

Airbus, which offers a larger version called LEAP-1A on its new A320neo aircraft family, said on Wednesday it continued to conduct normal test flights and was unaffected.

However, it continues to experience delays in deliveries of the other choice of engine for that type of aircraft, the Geared Turbofan made by Pratt & Whitney .

UPDATE 4-Boeing suspends 737 MAX flights due to engine issue - 路透新闻

By Alwyn Scott

SEATTLE, May 10 (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Wednesday it had temporarily halted test flights of its new 737 MAX aircraft due to an issue with the engine, which is jointly made by General Electric Co and Safran SA of France.

The grounding comes days before Boeing was due to deliver its first 737 MAX to an airline and marks a high-profile delay in a program that Boeing had said was ahead of schedule.

It poses no safety concerns for travelers because no airlines are yet flying the 737 MAX but it could mean a costly disruption if the problem persists. Timely delivery is important to planemakers as they get most of the payment for a plane when it is handed to the buyer.

Boeing and engine maker CFM said they do not know how long the delay will last.

Boeing shares fell 1.3 percent to $183.15 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. GE shares were down 0.9 percent at $28.67.

The 737 MAX replaces an older version of Boeing's best-selling single-aisle aircraft, a key moneymaker for the aerospace company. The 737 MAX 8, the first version of the plane to be built, seats 162 passengers in a typical two-class configuration. It carries a list price of $110 million but airlines typically receive steep discounts.

A delay in getting aircraft to customers likely would cause a build up in Boeing's inventory, "as planes essentially sit waiting for engines," said analyst Rob Stallard at Vertical Research Partners.

"Investors are acutely focused" on the risks of speeding up production of the new engine, known as the LEAP-1B, he said.

Separately, Airbus said it was continuing flights with its A320neo, which is powered by the similar LEAP-1A engine and is flying customers. [nL8N1IC89K]

The 737 MAX grounding likely will mean a delay for Malindo Air, a Malaysian carrier that had been expected to receive the first 737 MAX delivery as early as Monday. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA , which was due to receive its first 737 MAX near the end of May, said it expected a "a few days' delay."

"This will, however, not delay the launch of our upcoming trans-Atlantic routes from the United States to Edinburgh," spokesman Anders Lindstrom said in an email.

Southwest Airlines Co , the initial customer for the 737 MAX, said Boeing had not warned it of any delays to its delivery schedule. Southwest is expected to begin receiving the jet later in the year after it retires some older 737s.

American Airlines Group Inc , which has 100 737 MAX jets on order, declined to comment.

The issue arose late last week when Safran found a quality problem in a large metal disc used in the low-pressure turbine at the rear of the engine, said Jamie Jewell, a spokesman for the engine maker, CFM International.

CFM notified Boeing, which immediately grounded the fleet of about 21 planes. GE spokesman Rick Kennedy said the disc that prompted the concern had not been installed in an engine.

"There have been no issues whatsoever with engines in the field," Jewell said.

All of the 30 to 40 engines that have been built so far will be sent either to Lafayette, Indiana, or Villaroche, France, for inspection, Kennedy said. Many will need to be removed from aircraft and shipped, Jewell said.

It was not clear how long the inspections would take to complete. Safran received the disc from a supplier but there are other suppliers of that part so production of the engine was continuing, Kennedy said.

UPDATE 1-Nigeria to start General Electric railway talks -minister - 路透新闻

{{20170510T145931.114+0000}}UPDATE 1-Nigeria to start General Electric railway talks -minister(Adds detail, background)

ABUJA, May 10 (Reuters) - Nigeria will enter negotiations with General Electric (GE) over a railway project in the West African country, transport minister Rotimi Amaechi said on Wednesday.

Economic growth in Africa's most populous nation has been hampered for decades by its dilapidated rail network, built mainly by British colonial rulers before independence in 1960.

U.S. company GE had submitted the only bid for the $2 billion project connecting northern cities to the south of the country, according to a procurement process adviser, doing so in partnership with Transnet [CGETR.UL] of South Africa, Dutch-based APM Terminals and China's Sinohydro Consortium. [nL5N1H676R]

"Cabinet has approved that we commence negotiations," Amaechi told reporters after a cabinet meeting.

The concession will cover about 3,500 km (2,200 miles) of existing narrow-gauge lines from the southwestern commercial capital Lagos to Kano in the north and from southeastern oil hub Port Harcourt to Maiduguri in the northeast.

Nigeria's upper chamber of parliament, the Senate, said in November that it would investigate the railway concession over possible violations by Nigerian officials. [nL8N1D97GZ]

BREAKINGVIEWS-Buffett halo-stripping compounds IBM's pain - 路透新闻

{{20170505T190020.363+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Buffett halo-stripping compounds IBM's pain(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Robert Cyran

NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Berkshire Hathaway investments serve as seals of approval for the market. They can be worth billions – especially to firms like Goldman Sachs and GE in the midst of a crisis. But share sales by the Oracle of Omaha can send an ominous signal, as IBM discovered when its shares dropped on Friday.

The halo effect of Warren Buffett purchases isn't surprising given his record of outperforming the market. The airline sector rose 3 percent in February on news Berkshire had bought shares in four big airlines. News of an investment in Kinder Morgan sent the pipeline firm's stock up 10 percent last year.

Buffett has long avoided technology companies. He admitted he didn't understand them sufficiently, and said progress eroded the moats protecting their businesses. Yet he made a rare exception in 2011, investing $11 billion in IBM, touting the company's superior capital allocation. Berkshire had actually been buying the stock for more than six months, on the hush. The Securities and Exchange Commission gave the insurer a waiver from prompt disclosure rules because Berkshire argued that news of its interest would drive up the price.

The Buffett effect is most noticeable, and valuable, in times of crisis. During the worst of the stock-market meltdown in 2008, Berkshire made investments on advantageous terms in companies including Goldman Sachs, General Electric, Swiss Re and Harley Davidson. Those purchases not only provided the firms with desperately needed cash, they fostered confidence that enabled the companies to tap capital markets.

Yet withdrawal of the halo can hurt. News that Berkshire had sold a third of its IBM stake vaporized about $4.5 billion of that company's market value. After 20 straight quarters of revenue declines, the stock is trading below Berkshire's cost basis. Buffett's greater pain is the opportunity cost of missed chances. The S&P 500 has risen about 80 percent since his initial IBM investment.

Buffett probably doesn't have too many more halos to award – and existing ones may not last too long. He's 86, and is gradually handing more of Berkshire's investment decisions to lieutenants. Yet Berkshire retains big stakes in Kraft Heinz , Wells Fargo , DaVita , American Express , USG and others. Big Blue won't be the last to feel the sting of losing Buffett's seal of approval.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Warren Buffett said on May 4 that Berkshire Hathaway had sold about 25 million IBM shares. The conglomerate owned 81.2 million shares in the company in March, which was equivalent to 8.5 percent of the technology company.

- Berkshire Hathaway first announced it had bought IBM in November 2011, when it said it had acquired a 5.4 percent stake worth $12 billion. The company began acquiring shares in March of that year and the Securities and Exchange Commission allowed Berkshire to not disclose its stake in two subsequent quarterly reports.

- "I don't value IBM the same way that I did six years ago when I started buying," Buffett told CNBC in an interview. "I've revalued it somewhat downward." Buffett said he doesn't think Berkshire will be selling any more shares. Berkshire's cost basis for its IBM shares is $170.

- IBM's stock fell 3 percent on news of the sale, to around $154 a share. In April, IBM reported its 20th consecutive quarter of declining sales.

GE CEO warns against U.S. protectionism, wants level playing field  - 路透新闻

{{20170505T011536.509+0000}}GE CEO warns against U.S. protectionism, wants level playing field By David Lawder

WASHINGTON, May 4 (Reuters) - General Electric Co Chief Executive Jeff Immelt warned the Trump administration on Thursday to avoid protectionist policies while calling on it to level the playing field for American companies with tax reform, revived export financing and improved trade agreements.

In a speech at Georgetown University, Immelt said American companies and policymakers should "try harder" to compete in the global economy and win.

Public sentiment toward globalization and free trade has permanently changed because of their associations with outsourcing that has held down wages, China's rise as an export power and job losses, so a new definition was needed, he said.

"Because of these factors, we are not going back to a pure free trade world," Immelt said. "But is protectionism the answer? I guarantee you ... we have the most to lose through protectionism."

The Trump administration has taken steps toward increasing trade barriers around some industries, launching national security reviews that could restrict steel and aluminum imports. It also has pulled out of a 12-country Pacific Rim trade deal and vowed to renegotiate the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement in order to help reduce the U.S. trade deficits with Mexico and Canada.

Immelt said that if U.S. leaders think Americans want to live without the benefits of global economic integration, "they're in for a rude awakening. We need to fight for new technologies not old ones."

Instead of withdrawing from trade deals, Immelt said the United States should work to modernize and improve them, and NAFTA represented a prime opportunity.

"We will not grow if we don't trade with people," he said.

Immelt also called for the government to level the playing field with tax reform, and said the Trump administration's tax proposals would achieve much of this, including through a territorial tax system with lower rates. He also put in a plug for a border adjustment tax that would favor U.S. exporters.

"All of our global competitors have some form of a border adjustment," he said. "Isn't it worth a debate?"

Immelt also called for the full revival of the U.S. Export-Import Bank as a way to better compete with China, Germany and other countries that offer government-backed export lending. EXIM has been unable to approve financing deals over $10 million - excluding Boeing aircraft and GE power turbines - due to the lingering effects of a long fight in Congress to close the trade bank.

FACTBOX-China's narrow-body C919 jet - 路透新闻

{{20170504T230002.370+0000}}FACTBOX-China's narrow-body C919 jetSHANGHAI, May 5 (Reuters) - China's C919 narrow-body jet will make its first flight on Friday, capping a more than decade-long journey to build a plane which Beijing wants to use to compete against Boeing and Airbus . [nL4N1I61EL]

Here are facts about the jet:

- The single-aisle twin-engine plane was made by state planemaker Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC)[CMAFC.UL], with seating for 158 to 168 passengers, but the maiden flight will be made with no passenger seats.

- The plane will have a range of between 4,075 kilometers and 5,555 kilometers (2,532 miles - 3,452 miles).

- China Eastern Airlines <600115.SS> is the launch customer for the plane, which is powered by engines from French-U.S. supplier CFM International, jointly owned by General Electric and Safran .

- Other parts come from global suppliers such as Honeywell International Inc , United Technologies Corp's subsidiary Goodrich, Rockwell Collins Inc and Parker-Hannifin Corp unit Parker Aerospace.

- COMAC has just over 50 people in its sales and marketing departments, a fraction of those at Boeing and Airbus.

- The C919, nicknamed "Big Nine" and "Fatty Nine", has chalked up 570 firm orders and commitments from 23 customers, mainly Chinese state-backed airlines and leasing companies.

- Its only foreign buyer so far is leasing firm GE Capital Aviation Services, owned by General Electric.

- The safety certification of the new plane - which state media says will have a catalog price tag of around $50 million, less than half that of a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 - could be among the biggest issues for the C919 internationally.

- Europe's aviation safety regulator has said it has started the certification process for the C919 aircraft, a sign of closer ties between the two aviation markets. [nL4N1HY4DX]

BREAKINGVIEWS-Time for Siemens investors to forget troubled past - 路透新闻

{{20170504T114811.897+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Time for Siemens investors to forget troubled past(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Olaf Storbeck

LONDON, May 4 (Reuters Breakingviews) - A company's share price usually reflects hopes for the future. Investors' views of Siemens , however, are clouded by its troubled past. For decades, the German engineering group displayed subpar profitability and a talent for botching large-scale projects. The consequence is a persistent discount to historically better-performing peers like GE and ABB .

When Chief Executive Joe Kaeser was appointed in the summer of 2013, following a series of profit warnings, Siemens shares were trading at a price-earnings multiple 10 percent below that of other industrial conglomerates, Thomson Reuters data show. The discount was hardly surprising. In the preceding 13 years, the company had racked up one-off charges worth 25 billion euros – equivalent to more than one-fifth of its current market value. Items such as fines for paying bribes, penalties for not delivering trains on time, warranty costs for faulty wind turbines and writedowns on the acquisition of a doomed solar company, dented earnings by an average of 30 percent a year over that period, according to Liberum analysts.

Kaeser has cut red tape, hived off non-core businesses like consumer appliances and invested heavily in fast-growing, margin-rich software operations. Most importantly, he has ended the streak of one-off charges by overhauling Siemens' project management and appointing 100 managers who constantly assess and monitor risks attached to big-ticket orders.

The approach is working. The first three months of 2017 marked the sixth consecutive quarter without any nasty surprises. Since 2013, the group's operating margin is up by a fifth and earnings per share have risen by a third. Analysts polled by Reuters expect the group's operating margin to widen by another 2 percentage points to more than 11 percent by 2019. The impending partial spin-off of Siemens' healthcare business should also help to reduce its conglomerate discount.

All this is only partly reflected in Siemens' share price. Under Kaeser the company has produced a total shareholder return of close to 80 percent, well ahead of 34 percent at GE and 28 percent at ABB. Yet this mainly reflects improved earnings. Siemens' valuation discount to its peers remains a stubborn 9 percent. It's time for shareholders to start looking ahead.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Siemens on May 4 reported better-than-expected results for the three months to March. Orders rose 1 percent to 22.6 billion euros ($24.6 billion) compared with the same period in 2016, while revenue was up 5 percent at 20.2 billion euros.

- Industrial business profit increased 18 percent year-on-year to 2.49 billion euros, giving Siemens a profit margin of 12.1 percent.

- Six of the industrial group's eight business units exceeded profit forecasts from analysts polled by Reuters. Siemens reiterated its guidance for the full year. It expects modest revenue growth and industrial profit margin of between 11 percent and 12 percent.

- Siemens shares were down 1 percent to 131.05 euros by 0906 BST on May 4.

EXCLUSIVE-Iran in talks with UK over jetliner export funding - 路透新闻

{{20170504T085022.903+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Iran in talks with UK over jetliner export funding* Iran official says UK agency offers to fund some Airbus exports

* Says UK agency also willing to back some Boeing sales to Iran

* Funding could ease implementation of nuclear sanctions deal

* UK export agency, aircraft makers decline to comment

By Tim Hepher

PARIS, May 4 (Reuters) - Iran is in talks with Britain's export credit agency to facilitate the financing of aircraft sales to state airline IranAir as part of its pact with world powers to lift sanctions over its nuclear programme, a senior Iranian official said.

IranAir's plan to buy more than 180 jets from Airbus [AIR.PA] and Boeing is the most visible economic deal on the table after major powers last year lifted most sanctions on Iran in return for restrictions on its nuclear activities.

But financing for the purchases has been hard to secure because most Western banks are holding back, concerned about the future of the 2015 agreement after U.S. President Donald Trump called it a bad deal and ordered a review.

So far, IranAir has taken delivery of just three Airbus jets, for which it paid cash, industry sources say.

Deputy Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan said the UK's export credit arm, UK Export Finance (UKEF), had tentatively offered support for least some Airbus jets built in Britain, France, Germany and Spain. It could also offer some support to Airbus's U.S. rival, Boeing, he added.

"We have received some offers from UKEF, that is under review by Iran," Fakhrieh-Kashan told Reuters.

Two aircraft industry sources who asked not to be named also confirmed talks were taking place.

UKEF and both major planemakers declined to comment.

Countries in parts of the world where banks won't invest often turn to European and U.S. governments for export credits or loan insurance when they want to buy big-ticket items like aircraft from those countries' companies.

About 6 percent of aircraft deliveries depend on such support, which removes some but not all of the risks banks face in lending to airlines with poor credit, helping to grease the wheels of trade.

This fallback system has been frozen for more than a year, however, as European agencies demand more controls after Airbus acknowledged making faulty applications for UK aid, triggering a fraud probe, and UKEF's equivalent in Washington, the Export-Import Bank (EXIM), faced a battle over its future.

U.S. President Donald Trump hinted in his campaign he might get rid of the EXIM Bank, which some conservative members of Congress have argued perpetuates cronyism. He has since talked up the benefits of exports for U.S. jobs and in April nominated a new bank president and a member of the board. [nL8N1HM1JZ]

IRAN, UK ELECTIONS

Speeding up aircraft deliveries is seen as a priority for Tehran as President Hassan Rouhani's government seeks to show results from the sanctions deal ahead of elections on May 19.

Iran says the prospect of buying Western jets to renew its decaying fleet was built into the 2015 nuclear deal and that any barriers to completing the purchases would undermine the accord.

On the UK side, Prime Minister Theresa May's recent decision to hold a snap election in early June means any new funding deal is unlikely to be finalised before then.

UK government agencies like UKEF avoid major new initiatives during campaigning and a deal involving a topic as sensitive as trade with Iran would need approval before it could go ahead.

Airbus said last week on an investors' call that it hoped to receive some support from European export financing agencies this year.

But a source familiar with the process said it remained unclear how quickly UKEF would lift a temporary ban on Airbus funding as the UK and French fraud investigation continues.

If UKEF provides support for Boeing deliveries, it would not be the first time, but it would be rare. The main proviso is that a certain proportion of parts in each jet need to be made in Britain - usually 20 percent.

For Boeing exports, that would typically mean the jets would have to have Rolls-Royce engines. The Boeing planes ordered by Iran all have engines made by U.S. supplier General Electric or GE and its French partner Safran .

UKEF has said in the past it recognises the need to be flexible on foreign content in view of global supply chains. People who have dealt with the agency before say it may be able to consider equipment bought by Boeing from British companies.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Buffett halo-stripping compounds IBM's pain - 路透新闻

{{20170505T190020.363+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Buffett halo-stripping compounds IBM's pain(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Robert Cyran

NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Berkshire Hathaway investments serve as seals of approval for the market. They can be worth billions – especially to firms like Goldman Sachs and GE in the midst of a crisis. But share sales by the Oracle of Omaha can send an ominous signal, as IBM discovered when its shares dropped on Friday.

The halo effect of Warren Buffett purchases isn't surprising given his record of outperforming the market. The airline sector rose 3 percent in February on news Berkshire had bought shares in four big airlines. News of an investment in Kinder Morgan sent the pipeline firm's stock up 10 percent last year.

Buffett has long avoided technology companies. He admitted he didn't understand them sufficiently, and said progress eroded the moats protecting their businesses. Yet he made a rare exception in 2011, investing $11 billion in IBM, touting the company's superior capital allocation. Berkshire had actually been buying the stock for more than six months, on the hush. The Securities and Exchange Commission gave the insurer a waiver from prompt disclosure rules because Berkshire argued that news of its interest would drive up the price.

The Buffett effect is most noticeable, and valuable, in times of crisis. During the worst of the stock-market meltdown in 2008, Berkshire made investments on advantageous terms in companies including Goldman Sachs, General Electric, Swiss Re and Harley Davidson. Those purchases not only provided the firms with desperately needed cash, they fostered confidence that enabled the companies to tap capital markets.

Yet withdrawal of the halo can hurt. News that Berkshire had sold a third of its IBM stake vaporized about $4.5 billion of that company's market value. After 20 straight quarters of revenue declines, the stock is trading below Berkshire's cost basis. Buffett's greater pain is the opportunity cost of missed chances. The S&P 500 has risen about 80 percent since his initial IBM investment.

Buffett probably doesn't have too many more halos to award – and existing ones may not last too long. He's 86, and is gradually handing more of Berkshire's investment decisions to lieutenants. Yet Berkshire retains big stakes in Kraft Heinz , Wells Fargo , DaVita , American Express , USG and others. Big Blue won't be the last to feel the sting of losing Buffett's seal of approval.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Warren Buffett said on May 4 that Berkshire Hathaway had sold about 25 million IBM shares. The conglomerate owned 81.2 million shares in the company in March, which was equivalent to 8.5 percent of the technology company.

- Berkshire Hathaway first announced it had bought IBM in November 2011, when it said it had acquired a 5.4 percent stake worth $12 billion. The company began acquiring shares in March of that year and the Securities and Exchange Commission allowed Berkshire to not disclose its stake in two subsequent quarterly reports.

- "I don't value IBM the same way that I did six years ago when I started buying," Buffett told CNBC in an interview. "I've revalued it somewhat downward." Buffett said he doesn't think Berkshire will be selling any more shares. Berkshire's cost basis for its IBM shares is $170.

- IBM's stock fell 3 percent on news of the sale, to around $154 a share. In April, IBM reported its 20th consecutive quarter of declining sales.

GE CEO warns against U.S. protectionism, wants level playing field  - 路透新闻

{{20170505T011536.509+0000}}GE CEO warns against U.S. protectionism, wants level playing field By David Lawder

WASHINGTON, May 4 (Reuters) - General Electric Co Chief Executive Jeff Immelt warned the Trump administration on Thursday to avoid protectionist policies while calling on it to level the playing field for American companies with tax reform, revived export financing and improved trade agreements.

In a speech at Georgetown University, Immelt said American companies and policymakers should "try harder" to compete in the global economy and win.

Public sentiment toward globalization and free trade has permanently changed because of their associations with outsourcing that has held down wages, China's rise as an export power and job losses, so a new definition was needed, he said.

"Because of these factors, we are not going back to a pure free trade world," Immelt said. "But is protectionism the answer? I guarantee you ... we have the most to lose through protectionism."

The Trump administration has taken steps toward increasing trade barriers around some industries, launching national security reviews that could restrict steel and aluminum imports. It also has pulled out of a 12-country Pacific Rim trade deal and vowed to renegotiate the 23-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement in order to help reduce the U.S. trade deficits with Mexico and Canada.

Immelt said that if U.S. leaders think Americans want to live without the benefits of global economic integration, "they're in for a rude awakening. We need to fight for new technologies not old ones."

Instead of withdrawing from trade deals, Immelt said the United States should work to modernize and improve them, and NAFTA represented a prime opportunity.

"We will not grow if we don't trade with people," he said.

Immelt also called for the government to level the playing field with tax reform, and said the Trump administration's tax proposals would achieve much of this, including through a territorial tax system with lower rates. He also put in a plug for a border adjustment tax that would favor U.S. exporters.

"All of our global competitors have some form of a border adjustment," he said. "Isn't it worth a debate?"

Immelt also called for the full revival of the U.S. Export-Import Bank as a way to better compete with China, Germany and other countries that offer government-backed export lending. EXIM has been unable to approve financing deals over $10 million - excluding Boeing aircraft and GE power turbines - due to the lingering effects of a long fight in Congress to close the trade bank.

FACTBOX-China's narrow-body C919 jet - 路透新闻

{{20170504T230002.370+0000}}FACTBOX-China's narrow-body C919 jetSHANGHAI, May 5 (Reuters) - China's C919 narrow-body jet will make its first flight on Friday, capping a more than decade-long journey to build a plane which Beijing wants to use to compete against Boeing and Airbus . [nL4N1I61EL]

Here are facts about the jet:

- The single-aisle twin-engine plane was made by state planemaker Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC)[CMAFC.UL], with seating for 158 to 168 passengers, but the maiden flight will be made with no passenger seats.

- The plane will have a range of between 4,075 kilometers and 5,555 kilometers (2,532 miles - 3,452 miles).

- China Eastern Airlines <600115.SS> is the launch customer for the plane, which is powered by engines from French-U.S. supplier CFM International, jointly owned by General Electric and Safran .

- Other parts come from global suppliers such as Honeywell International Inc , United Technologies Corp's subsidiary Goodrich, Rockwell Collins Inc and Parker-Hannifin Corp unit Parker Aerospace.

- COMAC has just over 50 people in its sales and marketing departments, a fraction of those at Boeing and Airbus.

- The C919, nicknamed "Big Nine" and "Fatty Nine", has chalked up 570 firm orders and commitments from 23 customers, mainly Chinese state-backed airlines and leasing companies.

- Its only foreign buyer so far is leasing firm GE Capital Aviation Services, owned by General Electric.

- The safety certification of the new plane - which state media says will have a catalog price tag of around $50 million, less than half that of a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 - could be among the biggest issues for the C919 internationally.

- Europe's aviation safety regulator has said it has started the certification process for the C919 aircraft, a sign of closer ties between the two aviation markets. [nL4N1HY4DX]

BREAKINGVIEWS-Time for Siemens investors to forget troubled past - 路透新闻

{{20170504T114811.897+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Time for Siemens investors to forget troubled past(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Olaf Storbeck

LONDON, May 4 (Reuters Breakingviews) - A company's share price usually reflects hopes for the future. Investors' views of Siemens , however, are clouded by its troubled past. For decades, the German engineering group displayed subpar profitability and a talent for botching large-scale projects. The consequence is a persistent discount to historically better-performing peers like GE and ABB .

When Chief Executive Joe Kaeser was appointed in the summer of 2013, following a series of profit warnings, Siemens shares were trading at a price-earnings multiple 10 percent below that of other industrial conglomerates, Thomson Reuters data show. The discount was hardly surprising. In the preceding 13 years, the company had racked up one-off charges worth 25 billion euros – equivalent to more than one-fifth of its current market value. Items such as fines for paying bribes, penalties for not delivering trains on time, warranty costs for faulty wind turbines and writedowns on the acquisition of a doomed solar company, dented earnings by an average of 30 percent a year over that period, according to Liberum analysts.

Kaeser has cut red tape, hived off non-core businesses like consumer appliances and invested heavily in fast-growing, margin-rich software operations. Most importantly, he has ended the streak of one-off charges by overhauling Siemens' project management and appointing 100 managers who constantly assess and monitor risks attached to big-ticket orders.

The approach is working. The first three months of 2017 marked the sixth consecutive quarter without any nasty surprises. Since 2013, the group's operating margin is up by a fifth and earnings per share have risen by a third. Analysts polled by Reuters expect the group's operating margin to widen by another 2 percentage points to more than 11 percent by 2019. The impending partial spin-off of Siemens' healthcare business should also help to reduce its conglomerate discount.

All this is only partly reflected in Siemens' share price. Under Kaeser the company has produced a total shareholder return of close to 80 percent, well ahead of 34 percent at GE and 28 percent at ABB. Yet this mainly reflects improved earnings. Siemens' valuation discount to its peers remains a stubborn 9 percent. It's time for shareholders to start looking ahead.

EXCLUSIVE-Iran in talks with UK over jetliner export funding - 路透新闻

{{20170504T085022.903+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Iran in talks with UK over jetliner export funding* Iran official says UK agency offers to fund some Airbus exports

* Says UK agency also willing to back some Boeing sales to Iran

* Funding could ease implementation of nuclear sanctions deal

* UK export agency, aircraft makers decline to comment

By Tim Hepher

PARIS, May 4 (Reuters) - Iran is in talks with Britain's export credit agency to facilitate the financing of aircraft sales to state airline IranAir as part of its pact with world powers to lift sanctions over its nuclear programme, a senior Iranian official said.

IranAir's plan to buy more than 180 jets from Airbus [AIR.PA] and Boeing is the most visible economic deal on the table after major powers last year lifted most sanctions on Iran in return for restrictions on its nuclear activities.

But financing for the purchases has been hard to secure because most Western banks are holding back, concerned about the future of the 2015 agreement after U.S. President Donald Trump called it a bad deal and ordered a review.

So far, IranAir has taken delivery of just three Airbus jets, for which it paid cash, industry sources say.

Deputy Roads and Urban Development Minister Asghar Fakhrieh-Kashan said the UK's export credit arm, UK Export Finance (UKEF), had tentatively offered support for least some Airbus jets built in Britain, France, Germany and Spain. It could also offer some support to Airbus's U.S. rival, Boeing, he added.

"We have received some offers from UKEF, that is under review by Iran," Fakhrieh-Kashan told Reuters.

Two aircraft industry sources who asked not to be named also confirmed talks were taking place.

UKEF and both major planemakers declined to comment.

Countries in parts of the world where banks won't invest often turn to European and U.S. governments for export credits or loan insurance when they want to buy big-ticket items like aircraft from those countries' companies.

About 6 percent of aircraft deliveries depend on such support, which removes some but not all of the risks banks face in lending to airlines with poor credit, helping to grease the wheels of trade.

This fallback system has been frozen for more than a year, however, as European agencies demand more controls after Airbus acknowledged making faulty applications for UK aid, triggering a fraud probe, and UKEF's equivalent in Washington, the Export-Import Bank (EXIM), faced a battle over its future.

U.S. President Donald Trump hinted in his campaign he might get rid of the EXIM Bank, which some conservative members of Congress have argued perpetuates cronyism. He has since talked up the benefits of exports for U.S. jobs and in April nominated a new bank president and a member of the board. [nL8N1HM1JZ]

IRAN, UK ELECTIONS

Speeding up aircraft deliveries is seen as a priority for Tehran as President Hassan Rouhani's government seeks to show results from the sanctions deal ahead of elections on May 19.

Iran says the prospect of buying Western jets to renew its decaying fleet was built into the 2015 nuclear deal and that any barriers to completing the purchases would undermine the accord.

On the UK side, Prime Minister Theresa May's recent decision to hold a snap election in early June means any new funding deal is unlikely to be finalised before then.

UK government agencies like UKEF avoid major new initiatives during campaigning and a deal involving a topic as sensitive as trade with Iran would need approval before it could go ahead.

Airbus said last week on an investors' call that it hoped to receive some support from European export financing agencies this year.

But a source familiar with the process said it remained unclear how quickly UKEF would lift a temporary ban on Airbus funding as the UK and French fraud investigation continues.

If UKEF provides support for Boeing deliveries, it would not be the first time, but it would be rare. The main proviso is that a certain proportion of parts in each jet need to be made in Britain - usually 20 percent.

For Boeing exports, that would typically mean the jets would have to have Rolls-Royce engines. The Boeing planes ordered by Iran all have engines made by U.S. supplier General Electric or GE and its French partner Safran .

UKEF has said in the past it recognises the need to be flexible on foreign content in view of global supply chains. People who have dealt with the agency before say it may be able to consider equipment bought by Boeing from British companies.
