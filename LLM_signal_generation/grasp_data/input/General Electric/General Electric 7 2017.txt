{{20170801T212828.220+0000}}Sponsors may be tempted by Olympics return to Los AngelesBy Liana B. Baker

SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 1(Reuters) - Even if it is more than a decade away, a Summer Games in Los Angeles in 2028 may be a boost to the International Olympic Committee's (IOC) efforts to extend its lucrative contracts with top sponsors such as Visa Inc and Coca-Cola Co, Olympic sponsorship experts said.

Los Angeles agreed to host the 2028 Summer Games, after bowing out of a two-way contest with Paris for the 2024 Summer Games. Awarding two Summer Games in tandem is rare for the IOC, and under normal circumstances, the 2028 host city would not be known until 2021. [nL8N1K24H9]

U.S.-based multinational companies Visa , Coca-Cola , Procter & Gamble , Dow Chemical Co and General Electric Co make up about half of the IOC's top sponsors program, which contributes more than $1 billion in each four-year cycle to the games.

All of these brands' agreements with the IOC expire in 2020 after the Summer Games in Tokyo.

At least one U.S.-based sponsor, which spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said that it had been eager for the Games to return to the United States after so many years.

"LA is a homegrown market, a U.S. market for these companies that gives a tremendous boost to the likelihood that they will continue to stay on as sponsors," said Rob Prazmark, chief executive of 21 Sports & Entertainment Marketing Group, who helped create the top sponsors program with the IOC.

The 2028 U.S. Summer Games, the first Summer Games in the United States since 1996, could be a factor in the renewal discussions with sponsors that are currently underway, said John Grady, a sports law professor at the University of South Carolina.

"Once you have an American city, it puts a flame under that U.S. brand. They have a reason to renew that otherwise didn't exist," Grady said.

With the next three games in Asia, some U.S.-based sponsors have bowed out of their official Olympic sponsorship deals, though the IOC has signed on new Asia-based sponsors such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd .

McDonald's Corp ended a 41-year sponsorship deal with the IOC in June, and the U.S. Olympic Committee also has lost sponsors such as AT&T Inc and Citigroup Inc ahead of the 2018 Winter Games in South Korea. [nL3N1JD3QM]

Visa and Coca-Cola declined to comment beyond saying that their Olympic deals run until 2020. The IOC, P&G, Dow and GE did not respond to a request for comment. Intel, which signed on as a top sponsor in June, is locked in until 2024 and declined to comment.

Just knowing the location of Games 11 years out could also benefit U.S. broadcaster NBC, a unit of Comcast Corp , which is signed on until 2032, because it now has significant lead time to work with advertisers and deal with the changing ways people watch the Games over the internet, which has led to lower TV ratings.

An NBC spokesman, in a statement, called the next three host cities for the Summer Games, Tokyo, Paris and Los Angeles, "a U.S. broadcaster's dream."

UPDATE 2-Baker Hughes quarterly loss narrows; expects slower activity in H2 - Reuters News

{{20170728T132407.688+0000}}UPDATE 2-Baker Hughes quarterly loss narrows; expects slower activity in H2(Adds company outlook from filing, context, details about Latin America)

By Yashaswini Swamynathan and Liz Hampton

July 28 (Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Baker Hughes , now part of General Electric Co , expects growth in North American onshore activity to decelerate in the second half of this year, the company said on Friday in a filing.

The tempered outlook comes as oil prices fell from highs seen earlier in the year during the second quarter. This week, several major producers lowered capital spending plans for the remainder of the year. [nL1N1KI1DE]

GE's Baker Hughes said it expects international onshore activity to remain stable, with some areas of "modest growth," and global offshore drilling activity to remain muted due to lack of customer confidence in the direction of commodity prices.

Baker Hughes reported a smaller quarterly loss compared with a year earlier, when it incurred some restructuring charges.

Industrial conglomerate GE earlier this month closed the merger of its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes, leaping over rival Halliburton to create the No. 2 oilfield services provider. Baker Hughes' merger with Halliburton Co collapsed last May.

Net loss attributable to Baker Hughes narrowed to $179 million, or 42 cents per share in the second quarter ended June 30, from $911 million, or $2.08 per share, a year earlier. [nBwc5V7pSa]

Baker Hughes took restructuring charges of $1.13 billion and a goodwill impairment charge of $1.84 billion in the year-ago quarter.

Its second-quarter numbers do not include results from GE's oil and gas operations.

The company's revenue fell slightly to $2.40 billion in the second quarter, from $2.41 billion a year earlier. However, revenue climbed 6.3 percent from the preceding quarter due to increased drilling activity in the United States.

Higher oil prices have prompted an uptick in drilling activity, with companies adding 488 rigs in the past year, nearly double those in operation a year ago, according to the latest data from Baker Hughes.

Baker's shares were up slightly in pre-market trading at $36.16.

Halliburton and bigger rival Schlumberger Ltd have also benefited from a boom in North American drilling even though oil prices have stayed below $50 a barrel. [nL3N1KF3TH]

Baker Hughes reported a slight 3-percent increase in Latin America revenue sequentially, but said gains from shallow water activity in Mexico and increased sales in Argentina were offset by lower utilization of some services in Mexico and a decrease in artificial lift sales in Venezuela.

Both Halliburton and Schlumberger took a hit on bills owed by Venezuela in the second quarter. [nL1N1KG200]

UPDATE 2-Aero engine maker Safran core H1 income dips, still beats forecasts - Reuters News

{{20170728T105347.907+0000}}UPDATE 2-Aero engine maker Safran core H1 income dips, still beats forecasts(Adds details)

PARIS, July 28 (Reuters) - Aero engine maker Safran reported a 0.9 percent dip in core first-half profit on Friday as it carries out a product switch between its best-selling CFM56 engine and the new LEAP.

The French company, which recently sold its security business and won backing from its shareholders to go ahead with a reduced offer for Zodiac Aerospace , said ongoing operations were clouded by weaker propulsion earnings.

Recurring operating income fell to 1.218 billion euros ($1.42 billion) from 1.230 billion, dragging the operating margin 0.2 percentage points lower to 15.2 percent.

Revenues grew 0.6 percent or 2.4 percent on an underlying basis to 8.038 billion euros. The company reaffirmed targets.

Analysts were on average expecting an operating profit of 1.201 billion euros on revenues of 8.086 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S consensus data.

Margins fell by more than a percentage point at the propulsion division as lower deliveries of the profitable CFM56 made way for loss-making early deliveries of the LEAP and as the helicopter market remained depressed.

Aircraft equipment and defence margins rose, while civil aftermarket revenue grew 8.4 percent in dollar terms in the first half but failed to make up for other shortfalls.

Safran aims to break even on LEAP by the end of the decade.

Chief Executive Philippe Petitcolin said in a statement that the overall ramp-up of LEAP engines was going according to plan.

The engines, co-produced through Safran's CFM joint venture with General Electric , have nonetheless suffered some manufacturing glitches affecting Boeing and Airbus.

Although CFM has avoided the number of teething problems felt by rival Pratt & Whitney , India said on Thursday that its state carrier had experienced some delays in getting Airbus jets fitted with engines from the joint-venture. [nL3N1KI4ZV]

By Tim Hepher and Cyril Altmeyer

PARIS, July 28 (Reuters) - Aero engine maker Safran reported a 0.9 percent dip in core first-half profit on Friday that was still just above forecasts, as aircraft equipment and defence earnings offset headwinds from a switch to a new engine type.

The French company, which recently sold its security business and won backing from its shareholders to make a reduced offer for Zodiac Aerospace , said it hoped to go ahead with a formal Zodiac bid by the end of the year.

Production of the world's most-sold aircraft engine, the CFM56 co-produced with General Electric , is winding down in favour of its successor, the LEAP, which is ramping up. Progress is in line with plans but it is still making a loss.

Recurring operating income fell to 1.218 billion euros ($1.42 billion) from 1.230 billion, dragging the operating margin 0.2 percentage points lower to 15.2 percent, but profits slightly beat expectations because of growth in non-engine businesses which benefited from a two-year cost-cutting drive.

Safran shares fell around 1 percent, slightly outperforming a weaker market, as the company reaffirmed its targets.

Revenues grew 0.6 percent or 2.4 percent on an underlying basis to 8.038 billion euros.

Analysts were on average expecting an operating profit of 1.201 billion euros on revenues of 8.086 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S consensus data.

Civil aftermarket revenue grew 8.4 percent in dollar terms in the first half but was flat in the second quarter.

Safran said it expected the key services earnings figure to rebound in the second half amid strong airline traffic growth.

Safran aims to break even on LEAP in 2020, but together with GE it is in talks with planemakers over increased demand for engines that could theoretically speed the programme into the black earlier than expected [nL5N1KJ1TS].

Chief Executive Philippe Petitcolin cited a quality problem with a part on the model of the engine produced for Airbus. Any impact is expected to be minor, he said. [nL5N1KJ1H7]

The engines are co-produced for Airbus, Boeing and China's Comac through Safran's CFM International joint venture with General Electric .

Although CFM has avoided the number of teething problems felt by rival Pratt & Whitney , India said on Thursday its state carrier had experienced some delays in getting Airbus jets fitted with engines from the joint venture. [nL3N1KI4ZV]

Safran said its delayed Silvercrest business-jet engine was now on track but declined to comment on the progress of talks with Dassault Aviation over penalties.

UPDATE 4-Pratt & Whitney in hot seat as Airbus profits fall - Reuters News

{{20170727T150122.239+0000}}UPDATE 4-Pratt & Whitney in hot seat as Airbus profits fall* Q2 op profit down 27 pct, below expectations

* Shares fall as much as 4.6 pct

* 2017 delivery goal now subject to engine makers

* Airbus to cut A380 output again in 2019

(Adds India government statement, UTC shares)

By Tim Hepher and Cyril Altmeyer

PARIS, July 27 (Reuters) - Airbus turned up the heat on engine maker Pratt & Whitney over delays that have disrupted its biggest production line, after reporting a sharp drop in mid-year profits on Thursday.

The European planemaker also said it would cut output of the A380, the world's biggest jetliner, to just eight from 2019, putting on life support a project that has been undercut by a generation of nimbler, fuel-efficient long-haul planes.

Airbus's shares fell as much as 4.6 percent as investors contrasted its fortunes with those of U.S. arch-rival Boeing , whose stock hit a record high on Wednesday after its quarterly profit and cashflow beat estimates. [nL3N1KH44M]

Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders challenged Pratt & Whitney, whose fuel-saving Geared Turbofan (GTF) engine is tied to thousands of orders for small A320neo jetliners, to "work harder" to fix delays and reliability problems.

In an unusual public split with a major supplier, he said the engine maker had failed to meet earlier commitments and took issue with confidence over deliveries voiced by Pratt parent United Technologies .

"You can assume that Airbus is fully in the picture and knows what it is talking about," he told reporters, asked about the difference in tone accompanying their respective forecasts.

"If there is a difference in messaging and perception, then there is a difference, but our picture is the picture we have at Airbus and ... the situation is unsatisfactory," he said.

Pratt & Whitney had no immediate comment.

United Technologies this week said it was "confident" about building a total of 350-400 GTFs this year. [nL3N1KG3UD]

Airbus reiterated its own delivery goal but added a proviso, saying it depended on engine makers meeting commitments.

Jefferies analyst Howard Rubel wrote that only 300 GTF engines may qualify as paid customer deliveries in 2017.

Delays in A320neo deliveries helped slice a third off Airbus first-half profit on flat revenue. Its shares fell despite progress on the ramp-up of the wide-body A350 jet and confirmation of financial targets.

United Technologies shares fell 1.3 percent.

A380 OUTPUT CUT

Enders confirmed Airbus had delivered "around 15" Pratt-powered A320neo twin-engined aircraft in the first half compared with around 100 planned for that variant in 2017. [nL5N1KH4LL]

Asked how this squared with the 134 engines that Pratt says it delivered in the first half, Enders said deliveries of aircraft depended on customer acceptance. [nL3N1KG3UD]

Industry sources say some airlines have been refusing to take Pratt-powered jets because of the lack of available spares.

India, whose airlines have ordered hundreds of Pratt-powered A320neos, said Pratt had told its regulators it would address delays affecting GoAir and IndiGo. Air India has also had delays in getting jets with CFM engines, a minister said. [nL3N1KI4ZV]

The A320neo is one of several challenges as Airbus tries to accelerate output of new jetliners, fix glitches on its A400M military plane and squeeze costs out of the slow-selling A380.

Airbus said it would cut output of the double-decker jet to eight in 2019, a move that insiders said was designed to stretch the dwindling order backlog into the next decade while Airbus tries to convince Emirates, IAG and others to place new orders.

That compares with 15 this year and 12 in 2018 and means production will continue at what Airbus calls a marginal loss.

Enders said Airbus was working on sales campaigns but the probability of immediate success was "not ... necessarily high".

The second output cut in a year puts off any decision on whether to close the iconic A380, which would force the company to pay redundancies and writedowns but also ease some pressure on its balance sheet from project debts to European governments.

Enders said Airbus was in "constructive talks" with Qatar Airways over a recent cancellation of four A350s, adding, "I think we will find a way out" of the issue. [nL8N1JX4F5]

Airbus' second quarter operating profit fell 27 percent to 859 million euros on revenues of 15.27 billion.

That fell short of the 910 million euros on revenue of 15.82 billion expected by analysts polled by Reuters. [nL5N1KG49A] ($1 = 0.8516 euros)

UPDATE 7-GE shares fall as profit slumps, investors await new CEO's targets - Reuters News

{{20170721T190958.811+0000}}UPDATE 7-GE shares fall as profit slumps, investors await new CEO's targets* Q2 profit and revenue top Wall St estimates

* GE sees 2017 profit, cash flow at low end of forecast

* Analyst: stock 'in a state of limbo' ahead of new targets

* Shares down 3 percent after touching 2-year low

(Adds BreakingViews link)

By Alwyn Scott

July 21 (Reuters) - General Electric Co's shares dropped sharply on Friday after it posted a 59-percent decline in second-quarter profit and put off an expected cut to 2018 earnings targets until November, when new CEO John Flannery will be four months into his job.

The maker of power plants, jet engines, medical scanners and other industrial equipment said profit and sales declines largely reflected sale of its appliances business.

It beat analyst expectations on adjusted profit, but cash flow was weak and GE said full-year profit and cash flow will be at the low end of its forecasts.

GE also said it would update its 2018 earnings target of $2 a share in November, later than analysts had expected. Analyst consensus 2018 estimate is $1.73, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, already suggesting a significant cut. [nL1N1KC0D2]

The length and scope of the review raised concern, since GE has just come through major shifts in its portfolio.

"It's discouraging that we're going to wait again for the company to perform as we wait for the new CEO to review everything," said Jim Corridore, analyst at research firm CFRA, which cut GE shares to "hold" after Friday's results.

Incoming CEO Flannery acknowledged on a conference call that his review would take time, but said it had not altered GE's 2017 outlook.

Still, the stock could be in "in a state of limbo" until the review is finished, Deane Dray, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note.

GE's cash flow was below expectations and also weighed on the stock, said Jeff Windau, analyst at Edward Jones. "People want to get the answers sooner" to Flannery's review.

Shares were down 3 percent at $25.87 in mid-morning trading after earlier hitting a 2-year low. [nL3N1KC484]

GE faced a "slow-growth, volatile environment" in the quarter, Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said in his final earnings release before his Aug. 1 retirement.

Immelt's tenure began days before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and included the 2008 financial crisis. While GE stock is 27 percent below its price when Immelt arrived, it has more than tripled from its nadir in 2009.

Immelt sold off NBCUniversal, appliances and most of GE Capital. He acquired power assets from France's Alstom , merged GE's oil and gas business with Baker Hughes, and moved the headquarters to Boston.

Flannery said he is "in the middle of a series of deep dives into the businesses." He also is "taking a hard look at our corporate spending" to ensure it contributes to earnings, and on a listening tour of investors.

GE has cut $670 million in industrial overhead costs this year, Immelt said, and will "meet or exceed" its $1 billion target for 2017 - a goal set after discussion with activist investor Trian Fund Management.

GE was under pressure to report strong cash flow after a weak showing in the first quarter. Cash flow from operations totaled $3.6 billion, up from $400 million in the first quarter. The figure was down 67 percent from a year ago, partly reflecting the loss of contributions from the appliances division.

Revenue fell 12 percent to $29.56 billion, slightly above the $29.02 billion consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. GE said its appliances sale eliminated $3.1 billion of revenue.

Net profit slumped 59 percent to $1.34 billion, or 15 cents a share, in the quarter ended June 30, from $3.30 billion, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier.

Adjusted earnings fell 45 percent to 28 cents a share, compared with estimates for 25 cents.

By Richard Leong

NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields fell on Friday, with benchmark yields hitting three-week lows, as the euro reached a near two-year high against dollar, raising doubts whether the European Central Bank would scale back its bond purchases later in 2017.

Wall Street stock indexes retreated from record peaks following weak results from General Electric Co , kindling safe-haven demand for low-risk government debt. [nL3N1KC4DR]

Trading volume was light in the absence of major U.S. economic data and some caution before next week's Federal Reserve policy meeting. [FED/DIARY]

The euro's surge, if sustained, would hurt European exporters and possibly force ECB policymakers to delay any plans to reduce quantitative easing. [nL5N1KC299]

"This is a directionality with the euro. The U.S. and Bunds spread is moving on that after the ECB meeting," Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at SG Corporate & Investment Banking in New York.

On Thursday, the ECB stuck to its ultra-loose policy stance as Europe's inflation remained below 2 percent, but traders perceived ECB President Mario Draghi's comments at his news conference as supportive to build bullish bets on the euro . [nL5N1KB1ZT]

The euro rose to $1.1677 earlier on Friday, the strongest since Aug. 24, 2015, while German 10-year yields traded as low as 0.496 percent, a two-week trough, Reuters data showed. [nL3N1KC3J0]

The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was down more than 3 basis points at 2.230 percent after hitting a three-week low of 2.225 percent.

The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 were down 0.2 percent and 0.1 percent, respectively. [nL3N1KC4DR]

Among Treasury bills, interest rates on T-bills due in October rose to their highest since October 2008 on risk of a default if Congress fails to raise the country's debt limit. [nL1N1KC112]

The Fed is widely expected to leave key interest rates unchanged in the wake of a softening in domestic inflation. [nL1N1K50H3]

"You have four CPI (consumer price index) prints which were not very good. Why are we concerned about inflation?" said Jim Caron, portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management in New York.

Caron and some analysts expect inflation to rebound in the second half of 2017 on positive year-over-year comparisons and a further tightening in the labor market.

An expected pause in the Fed holding U.S. rates has partly led to a decline in interest rate volatility.

An index compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch on one-month volatility on Treasury yields <.MERMOVE1M> has fallen in the past two weeks, recording an all-time low of 46.999 on Thursday.

further tightening in the labor market.

An expected pause in the Fed holding U.S. rates has partly
led to a decline in interest rate volatility.

An index compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch on
one-month volatility on Treasury yields <.MERMOVE1M> has fallen
in the past two weeks, recording an all-time low of 46.999 on
Thursday.

BREAKINGVIEWS-GE's new boss may find inspiration from Honeywell - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20170721T171142.818+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-GE's new boss may find inspiration from Honeywell(The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions expressed are their own.)

By Tom Buerkle and Antony Currie

NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters Breakingviews) - General Electric's new boss should look elsewhere for a role model. Jeff Immelt's weak earnings swan song at the $222 billion industrial giant underscores the challenge for successor John Flannery. Making quick progress on early goals is key, as Darius Adamczyk is doing several months in at Honeywell . With activists in both stocks, that should be a no-brainer.

GE's second-quarter performance wasn't all bad in the face of a "slow-growth, volatile environment," as Immelt put it. Revenue and adjusted earnings per share beat analysts' estimates, while organic revenue growth was on target at 4 percent and orders were up 5 percent.

There were plenty of weak spots, though. Low crude prices, a drop in U.S. locomotive orders and sluggish services depressed operating profit in the company's oil and gas, transportation and power divisions, respectively. The company is now targeting the low end of its previous range for second-half cash flow and full-year earnings per share. The disposal of its industrial-solutions business, which sells electrical equipment, may slip into next year.

Flannery, who takes over at the start of August, promises to take a fresh swipe at expenses with a zero-based budgeting exercise but won't unveil his overall plans until an investor day in November. Shareholders aren't waiting. Concern that his first move will be to lower earnings guidance for 2018 pushed the stock down nearly 3 percent to $25.94 in midday trading.

By contrast, Adamczyk hit the ground running, outlining some of his strategy in March, a month before taking the helm. He also took in his stride the April appearance of Daniel Loeb's Third Point. The activist believes selling the aerospace unit would boost shareholder value 20 percent.

Although he vows to look at all options, Adamczyk has overseen an improvement in the business. Aerospace revenue grew 2 percent in the latest quarter, excluding the sale of a business last year, while its operating margin hit 22.3 percent.

That helped new management to increase its full-year earnings outlook for the second quarter in a row and bumped up the company's overall margin to 19 percent. Not surprisingly, Honeywell's stock is trading at 19.3 times the midpoint of management's own estimates for this year's earnings, ahead of GE's 15.7 multiple. Flannery shouldn't waste time in putting his imagination to work.

CONTEXT NEWS

- General Electric on July 21 reported net income attributable to shareholders of $1.2 billion for the second quarter, down 59 percent from the same period a year earlier. Earnings adjusted to strip out expected disposals were 28 cents a share, compared with the consensus estimate of sell-side analysts of 25 cents.

- Revenue of $29.6 billion was down 12 percent, largely reflecting the sale of the company's appliances business. That exceeded analysts' expectations of $29 billion.

- Cash flow from operations fell 67 percent in the latest quarter from the same period a year earlier, to $3.6 billion. Orders were up 6 percent, at $28.3 billion. The company reduced expenses by $700 million in the first half of 2017. Earlier this year GE announced plans to cut costs by $1 billion by the end of December in response to pressure from activist Nelson Peltz's Trian Partners.

- Honeywell International on July 21 reported second-quarter net income attributable to common shareholders of $1.39 billion, a 5.5 percent increase on the same period last year. At $1.80, earnings per share beat the consensus estimate of sell-side analysts of $1.78 a share. Revenue of $9.9 billion beat the estimate of $9.89 billion.

- Activist hedge fund Third Point, run by Daniel Loeb, in April argued that Honeywell could increase shareholder value by $20 billion if it sold its aerospace unit. Revenue in that division fell 3 percent from last year's second quarter, lower than the company had expected as organic growth helped offset income lost from selling a part of the business. Aerospace's operating margin, meanwhile, increase 1.4 percentage points to 22.3 percent.

- Honeywell also increased its outlook for the year. It now expects revenue to be between $39.3 billion and $40 billion, up from its previous estimate of $38.6 billion to $39.5 billion.

By Tanya Agrawal

July 21 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes were lower in late morning trading and pulled back from record levels as weak earnings from industrial heavyweight General Electric weighed.

Shares of GE fell as much as 5.4 percent to their lowest level since Oct 2015, as the company reported a nearly 60 percent slump in profit and its 2017 profit forecast came in at the low end. [nL3N1KC3MP]

The stock's fall weighed on other industrials such as Caterpillar and 3M .

"We've had a good run for the last few weeks and investors are primarily digesting earnings today," said Erick Ormsby, chief executive of Alcosta Capital Management.

"GE's results were okay but they guided lower and that's weighing on the market too."

Microsoft fell 0.3 percent, despite the company reporting strong fourth-quarter earnings. [nL3N1KB5OZ]

Attention will turn to earnings from big tech names next week, including Amazon , Alphabet and Facebook .

The Nasdaq came off its 10-day streak of gains, its best since February 2015, after closing at record levels on Thursday.

The tech sector, however, continues to be the best performing S&P sector this year, despite concerns over stretched valuation, as investors look for growth from sectors relatively immune to a policy gridlock in Washington.

"If tech earnings were to disappoint, it might finally be the thing that causes a correction, even if it's a small one," said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.

Still, overall earnings are expected to be good with analysts expecting earnings to have climbed 8.6 percent, above the 8-percent rise projected at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

At 10:50 a.m. ET (1650 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> was down 72.93 points, or 0.34 percent, at 21,538.85, the S&P 500 <.SPX> was down 6.03 points, or 0.24 percent, at 2,467.42.

The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> was down 11.80 points, or 0.18 percent, at 6,378.20.

The S&P and the Nasdaq are on track to close higher for the third straight week.

All 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the industrials <.SPLRCI> and energy sectors <.SPNY> leading the decliners.

Oil prices fell more than 1.5 percent after a consultancy report forecast a rise in OPEC production for July despite the group's pledge to curb output. [O/R]

Visa rose 1.7 percent after the world's largest payments network operator raised its annual earnings forecast. [nL3N1KB5PH]

EBay fell 2.8 percent as the company warned that adjusted profit this quarter could fall below analysts' estimates. [nL3N1KB5Q7]

Honeywell International rose 1.7 percent after the technology and manufacturing company raised the low-end of its profit forecast. [nL3N1KC3LQ]

Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,635 to 1,059. On the Nasdaq, 1,464 issues fell and 1,164 advanced.

UPDATE 7-GE shares fall as profit slumps, investors await new CEO's targets - Reuters News

{{20170721T190958.811+0000}}UPDATE 7-GE shares fall as profit slumps, investors await new CEO's targets* Q2 profit and revenue top Wall St estimates

* GE sees 2017 profit, cash flow at low end of forecast

* Analyst: stock 'in a state of limbo' ahead of new targets

* Shares down 3 percent after touching 2-year low

(Adds BreakingViews link)

By Alwyn Scott

July 21 (Reuters) - General Electric Co's shares dropped sharply on Friday after it posted a 59-percent decline in second-quarter profit and put off an expected cut to 2018 earnings targets until November, when new CEO John Flannery will be four months into his job.

The maker of power plants, jet engines, medical scanners and other industrial equipment said profit and sales declines largely reflected sale of its appliances business.

It beat analyst expectations on adjusted profit, but cash flow was weak and GE said full-year profit and cash flow will be at the low end of its forecasts.

GE also said it would update its 2018 earnings target of $2 a share in November, later than analysts had expected. Analyst consensus 2018 estimate is $1.73, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, already suggesting a significant cut. [nL1N1KC0D2]

The length and scope of the review raised concern, since GE has just come through major shifts in its portfolio.

"It's discouraging that we're going to wait again for the company to perform as we wait for the new CEO to review everything," said Jim Corridore, analyst at research firm CFRA, which cut GE shares to "hold" after Friday's results.

Incoming CEO Flannery acknowledged on a conference call that his review would take time, but said it had not altered GE's 2017 outlook.

Still, the stock could be in "in a state of limbo" until the review is finished, Deane Dray, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note.

GE's cash flow was below expectations and also weighed on the stock, said Jeff Windau, analyst at Edward Jones. "People want to get the answers sooner" to Flannery's review.

Shares were down 3 percent at $25.87 in mid-morning trading after earlier hitting a 2-year low. [nL3N1KC484]

GE faced a "slow-growth, volatile environment" in the quarter, Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said in his final earnings release before his Aug. 1 retirement.

Immelt's tenure began days before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and included the 2008 financial crisis. While GE stock is 27 percent below its price when Immelt arrived, it has more than tripled from its nadir in 2009.

Immelt sold off NBCUniversal, appliances and most of GE Capital. He acquired power assets from France's Alstom , merged GE's oil and gas business with Baker Hughes, and moved the headquarters to Boston.

Flannery said he is "in the middle of a series of deep dives into the businesses." He also is "taking a hard look at our corporate spending" to ensure it contributes to earnings, and on a listening tour of investors.

GE has cut $670 million in industrial overhead costs this year, Immelt said, and will "meet or exceed" its $1 billion target for 2017 - a goal set after discussion with activist investor Trian Fund Management.

GE was under pressure to report strong cash flow after a weak showing in the first quarter. Cash flow from operations totaled $3.6 billion, up from $400 million in the first quarter. The figure was down 67 percent from a year ago, partly reflecting the loss of contributions from the appliances division.

Revenue fell 12 percent to $29.56 billion, slightly above the $29.02 billion consensus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. GE said its appliances sale eliminated $3.1 billion of revenue.

Net profit slumped 59 percent to $1.34 billion, or 15 cents a share, in the quarter ended June 30, from $3.30 billion, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier.

Adjusted earnings fell 45 percent to 28 cents a share, compared with estimates for 25 cents.

By Richard Leong

NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields fell on Friday, with benchmark yields hitting three-week lows, as the euro reached a near two-year high against dollar, raising doubts whether the European Central Bank would scale back its bond purchases later in 2017.

Wall Street stock indexes retreated from record peaks following weak results from General Electric Co , kindling safe-haven demand for low-risk government debt. [nL3N1KC4DR]

Trading volume was light in the absence of major U.S. economic data and some caution before next week's Federal Reserve policy meeting. [FED/DIARY]

The euro's surge, if sustained, would hurt European exporters and possibly force ECB policymakers to delay any plans to reduce quantitative easing. [nL5N1KC299]

"This is a directionality with the euro. The U.S. and Bunds spread is moving on that after the ECB meeting," Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at SG Corporate & Investment Banking in New York.

On Thursday, the ECB stuck to its ultra-loose policy stance as Europe's inflation remained below 2 percent, but traders perceived ECB President Mario Draghi's comments at his news conference as supportive to build bullish bets on the euro . [nL5N1KB1ZT]

The euro rose to $1.1677 earlier on Friday, the strongest since Aug. 24, 2015, while German 10-year yields traded as low as 0.496 percent, a two-week trough, Reuters data showed. [nL3N1KC3J0]

The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was down more than 3 basis points at 2.230 percent after hitting a three-week low of 2.225 percent.

The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 were down 0.2 percent and 0.1 percent, respectively. [nL3N1KC4DR]

Among Treasury bills, interest rates on T-bills due in October rose to their highest since October 2008 on risk of a default if Congress fails to raise the country's debt limit. [nL1N1KC112]

The Fed is widely expected to leave key interest rates unchanged in the wake of a softening in domestic inflation. [nL1N1K50H3]

"You have four CPI (consumer price index) prints which were not very good. Why are we concerned about inflation?" said Jim Caron, portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management in New York.

Caron and some analysts expect inflation to rebound in the second half of 2017 on positive year-over-year comparisons and a further tightening in the labor market.

An expected pause in the Fed holding U.S. rates has partly led to a decline in interest rate volatility.

An index compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch on one-month volatility on Treasury yields <.MERMOVE1M> has fallen in the past two weeks, recording an all-time low of 46.999 on Thursday.

BUZZ-General Electric: Demoted on the charts - Reuters News

** Stock has since mounted a bullish counter attack, pared losses, but downside risk remains on the charts. Chart: http://reut.rs/2uj4dnm

** GE, largest weight in S&P industrial sector <.SPLRCI>, about 10 pct of group's $2.25 trln market cap, has seen especially poor action YTD; stock now down ~18 pct

** Meanwhile, industrials just slightly underperforming S&P 500 <.SPX> YTD, up 9.3 pct vs 10.3 pct [nL1N1KB1C8]

** Indeed, GE/SPLRCI Ratio, which most recently peaked in early 2016, has been trending down since [nL1N1FH101]

** In fact, just last month, ratio violated its 2009 trough, falling to an all-time low as GE's trend of underperformance intensified ahead of its disappointing Q2 results [nL1N1KB0SX]

** With today's break, GE is oversold, and has finally filled a longstanding gap from early Oct 2015 (to $25.49)

** That said, trend of underperformance intact, and strength can be viewed as just a counter reaction unless can reclaim descending 200-DMA (now $29.49) and mid-Jun high ($29.47)

BREAKINGVIEWS-GE's new boss may find inspiration from Honeywell - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20170721T171142.818+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-GE's new boss may find inspiration from Honeywell(The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions expressed are their own.)

By Tom Buerkle and Antony Currie

NEW YORK, July 21 (Reuters Breakingviews) - General Electric's new boss should look elsewhere for a role model. Jeff Immelt's weak earnings swan song at the $222 billion industrial giant underscores the challenge for successor John Flannery. Making quick progress on early goals is key, as Darius Adamczyk is doing several months in at Honeywell . With activists in both stocks, that should be a no-brainer.

GE's second-quarter performance wasn't all bad in the face of a "slow-growth, volatile environment," as Immelt put it. Revenue and adjusted earnings per share beat analysts' estimates, while organic revenue growth was on target at 4 percent and orders were up 5 percent.

There were plenty of weak spots, though. Low crude prices, a drop in U.S. locomotive orders and sluggish services depressed operating profit in the company's oil and gas, transportation and power divisions, respectively. The company is now targeting the low end of its previous range for second-half cash flow and full-year earnings per share. The disposal of its industrial-solutions business, which sells electrical equipment, may slip into next year.

Flannery, who takes over at the start of August, promises to take a fresh swipe at expenses with a zero-based budgeting exercise but won't unveil his overall plans until an investor day in November. Shareholders aren't waiting. Concern that his first move will be to lower earnings guidance for 2018 pushed the stock down nearly 3 percent to $25.94 in midday trading.

By contrast, Adamczyk hit the ground running, outlining some of his strategy in March, a month before taking the helm. He also took in his stride the April appearance of Daniel Loeb's Third Point. The activist believes selling the aerospace unit would boost shareholder value 20 percent.

Although he vows to look at all options, Adamczyk has overseen an improvement in the business. Aerospace revenue grew 2 percent in the latest quarter, excluding the sale of a business last year, while its operating margin hit 22.3 percent.

That helped new management to increase its full-year earnings outlook for the second quarter in a row and bumped up the company's overall margin to 19 percent. Not surprisingly, Honeywell's stock is trading at 19.3 times the midpoint of management's own estimates for this year's earnings, ahead of GE's 15.7 multiple. Flannery shouldn't waste time in putting his imagination to work.

CONTEXT NEWS

- General Electric on July 21 reported net income attributable to shareholders of $1.2 billion for the second quarter, down 59 percent from the same period a year earlier. Earnings adjusted to strip out expected disposals were 28 cents a share, compared with the consensus estimate of sell-side analysts of 25 cents.

- Revenue of $29.6 billion was down 12 percent, largely reflecting the sale of the company's appliances business. That exceeded analysts' expectations of $29 billion.

- Cash flow from operations fell 67 percent in the latest quarter from the same period a year earlier, to $3.6 billion. Orders were up 6 percent, at $28.3 billion. The company reduced expenses by $700 million in the first half of 2017. Earlier this year GE announced plans to cut costs by $1 billion by the end of December in response to pressure from activist Nelson Peltz's Trian Partners.

- Honeywell International on July 21 reported second-quarter net income attributable to common shareholders of $1.39 billion, a 5.5 percent increase on the same period last year. At $1.80, earnings per share beat the consensus estimate of sell-side analysts of $1.78 a share. Revenue of $9.9 billion beat the estimate of $9.89 billion.

- Activist hedge fund Third Point, run by Daniel Loeb, in April argued that Honeywell could increase shareholder value by $20 billion if it sold its aerospace unit. Revenue in that division fell 3 percent from last year's second quarter, lower than the company had expected as organic growth helped offset income lost from selling a part of the business. Aerospace's operating margin, meanwhile, increase 1.4 percentage points to 22.3 percent.

- Honeywell also increased its outlook for the year. It now expects revenue to be between $39.3 billion and $40 billion, up from its previous estimate of $38.6 billion to $39.5 billion.

By Tanya Agrawal

July 21 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes were lower in late morning trading and pulled back from record levels as weak earnings from industrial heavyweight General Electric weighed.

Shares of GE fell as much as 5.4 percent to their lowest level since Oct 2015, as the company reported a nearly 60 percent slump in profit and its 2017 profit forecast came in at the low end. [nL3N1KC3MP]

The stock's fall weighed on other industrials such as Caterpillar and 3M .

"We've had a good run for the last few weeks and investors are primarily digesting earnings today," said Erick Ormsby, chief executive of Alcosta Capital Management.

"GE's results were okay but they guided lower and that's weighing on the market too."

Microsoft fell 0.3 percent, despite the company reporting strong fourth-quarter earnings. [nL3N1KB5OZ]

Attention will turn to earnings from big tech names next week, including Amazon , Alphabet and Facebook .

The Nasdaq came off its 10-day streak of gains, its best since February 2015, after closing at record levels on Thursday.

The tech sector, however, continues to be the best performing S&P sector this year, despite concerns over stretched valuation, as investors look for growth from sectors relatively immune to a policy gridlock in Washington.

"If tech earnings were to disappoint, it might finally be the thing that causes a correction, even if it's a small one," said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade.

Still, overall earnings are expected to be good with analysts expecting earnings to have climbed 8.6 percent, above the 8-percent rise projected at the start of the month, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

At 10:50 a.m. ET (1650 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> was down 72.93 points, or 0.34 percent, at 21,538.85, the S&P 500 <.SPX> was down 6.03 points, or 0.24 percent, at 2,467.42.

The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> was down 11.80 points, or 0.18 percent, at 6,378.20.

The S&P and the Nasdaq are on track to close higher for the third straight week.

All 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the industrials <.SPLRCI> and energy sectors <.SPNY> leading the decliners.

Oil prices fell more than 1.5 percent after a consultancy report forecast a rise in OPEC production for July despite the group's pledge to curb output. [O/R]

Visa rose 1.7 percent after the world's largest payments network operator raised its annual earnings forecast. [nL3N1KB5PH]

EBay fell 2.8 percent as the company warned that adjusted profit this quarter could fall below analysts' estimates. [nL3N1KB5Q7]

Honeywell International rose 1.7 percent after the technology and manufacturing company raised the low-end of its profit forecast. [nL3N1KC3LQ]

Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,635 to 1,059. On the Nasdaq, 1,464 issues fell and 1,164 advanced.

CORRECTED-What to Watch in the Day Ahead - Friday, July 21 - 路透新闻

{{20170720T193915.281+0000}}CORRECTED-What to Watch in the Day Ahead - Friday, July 21(Corrects Schlumberger item to say the company is expected to report a quarterly profit, not a smaller profit)

General Electric is expected to post a rise in profit and sales for the second quarter, but investors are focused on the company's ability to generate cash after a first-quarter cash performance that came in below expectations. Investors also are looking for cost cutting as the maker of power plants, locomotives, jet engines and other industrial equipment seeks to lift profit to $2 a share in 2018. This is the last earnings report under CEO Jeff Immelt, who turns over the top job to GE veteran John Flannery on Aug. 1. Flannery plans to conduct a speedy review of GE's portfolio, and the results are due to be announced in the second half.

Aero parts maker Honeywell International Inc is expected to report higher second-quarter profit, partly due to a rise in sales in its commercial aviation after-sales business, which provides repair and overhaul activities and spares for aircraft. Honeywell's commercial aviation after-sales business, part of its aerospace unit, is benefiting from robust air travel in the United States due to improving economic growth. The company said in May it would decide by fall this year whether to separate its aerospace business, a move hedge fund Third Point LLC wants the U.S. industrial conglomerate to pursue. Investors will look for any developments regarding the spinoff of the unit and comments on full-year financial forecast.

Schlumberger Ltd, the No. 1 oilfield service provider, is expected to report profit in the second quarter compared with a loss a year earlier driven by cost-control measures and uptick in drilling activity. Schlumberger's results sets the tone for oil companies' earning season and investors will be looking out for comments about the industry.

Kansas City Southern, which gets nearly half of its revenue from Mexico, is expected to report higher second-quarter profit and revenue, partly due to improved carload volumes of coal. Investors will look for comments on full-year financial forecast, and how President Donald Trump's policies might impact trade with Mexico.

Canadian oil and gas producer Encana Corp releases second-quarter earnings and holds a conference call for investors. The company has been streamlining its portfolio and last month agreed to sell its Piceance natural gas assets in the United States. Investors will be looking for any indications of further asset sales and details on the company's strategy and outlook as oil lingers below $50 a barrel.

Canada's Husky Energy Inc releases its second-quarter results and holds a conference call. Like its oil sands peers, Husky is grappling with lower-than-expected benchmark oil prices and investors will be looking out for changes to its 2017 capital spending plans.

Canada's annual inflation rate is expected to slide further away from the central bank's target to 1.0 percent in June, compared with 1.3 percent in May, while the common core measure is seen remaining subdued at 1.3 percent. The Bank of Canada, which hiked interest rates last week for the first time in nearly seven years, has said it expects tame inflation to be temporary but economists will watch the report to try to gauge the timing of the central bank's next rate increase. (0830/1230) Canadian retail sales are expected to have increased by just 0.2 percent in May, compared with a rise of 0.8 percent in April but that is still likely enough to maintain analysts' expectations that the economy had strong momentum in the second quarter. Retail sales, excluding automobiles, are likely to remain flat for May. (0830/1230)

Brazil is expected to show a current account surplus of $1.33 billion in June after it posted a surplus of $2.90 billion in May. The country is expected to attract $2.80 billion in foreign direct investment in June. (0930/1330) Mexico's statistics agency will release unemployment data, which is expected to show that the seasonally adjusted jobless rate remained unchanged at 3.50 percent in June from the previous month.

GUIDE TO EU MERGER PROCESS

DEADLINES:

The European Commission has 25 working days after a deal is filed for a first-stage review. It may extend that by 10 working days to 35 working days, to consider either a company's proposed remedies or an EU member state's request to handle the case.

Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90 additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working days.

SIMPLIFIED:

Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved.

CORRECTED-What to Watch in the Day Ahead - Friday, July 21 - 路透新闻

{{20170720T193915.281+0000}}CORRECTED-What to Watch in the Day Ahead - Friday, July 21(Corrects Schlumberger item to say the company is expected to report a quarterly profit, not a smaller profit)

General Electric is expected to post a rise in profit and sales for the second quarter, but investors are focused on the company's ability to generate cash after a first-quarter cash performance that came in below expectations. Investors also are looking for cost cutting as the maker of power plants, locomotives, jet engines and other industrial equipment seeks to lift profit to $2 a share in 2018. This is the last earnings report under CEO Jeff Immelt, who turns over the top job to GE veteran John Flannery on Aug. 1. Flannery plans to conduct a speedy review of GE's portfolio, and the results are due to be announced in the second half.

Aero parts maker Honeywell International Inc is expected to report higher second-quarter profit, partly due to a rise in sales in its commercial aviation after-sales business, which provides repair and overhaul activities and spares for aircraft. Honeywell's commercial aviation after-sales business, part of its aerospace unit, is benefiting from robust air travel in the United States due to improving economic growth. The company said in May it would decide by fall this year whether to separate its aerospace business, a move hedge fund Third Point LLC wants the U.S. industrial conglomerate to pursue. Investors will look for any developments regarding the spinoff of the unit and comments on full-year financial forecast.

Schlumberger Ltd, the No. 1 oilfield service provider, is expected to report profit in the second quarter compared with a loss a year earlier driven by cost-control measures and uptick in drilling activity. Schlumberger's results sets the tone for oil companies' earning season and investors will be looking out for comments about the industry.

Kansas City Southern, which gets nearly half of its revenue from Mexico, is expected to report higher second-quarter profit and revenue, partly due to improved carload volumes of coal. Investors will look for comments on full-year financial forecast, and how President Donald Trump's policies might impact trade with Mexico.

Canadian oil and gas producer Encana Corp releases second-quarter earnings and holds a conference call for investors. The company has been streamlining its portfolio and last month agreed to sell its Piceance natural gas assets in the United States. Investors will be looking for any indications of further asset sales and details on the company's strategy and outlook as oil lingers below $50 a barrel.

Canada's Husky Energy Inc releases its second-quarter results and holds a conference call. Like its oil sands peers, Husky is grappling with lower-than-expected benchmark oil prices and investors will be looking out for changes to its 2017 capital spending plans.

Canada's annual inflation rate is expected to slide further away from the central bank's target to 1.0 percent in June, compared with 1.3 percent in May, while the common core measure is seen remaining subdued at 1.3 percent. The Bank of Canada, which hiked interest rates last week for the first time in nearly seven years, has said it expects tame inflation to be temporary but economists will watch the report to try to gauge the timing of the central bank's next rate increase. (0830/1230) Canadian retail sales are expected to have increased by just 0.2 percent in May, compared with a rise of 0.8 percent in April but that is still likely enough to maintain analysts' expectations that the economy had strong momentum in the second quarter. Retail sales, excluding automobiles, are likely to remain flat for May. (0830/1230)

Brazil is expected to show a current account surplus of $1.33 billion in June after it posted a surplus of $2.90 billion in May. The country is expected to attract $2.80 billion in foreign direct investment in June. (0930/1330) Mexico's statistics agency will release unemployment data, which is expected to show that the seasonally adjusted jobless rate remained unchanged at 3.50 percent in June from the previous month.

UPDATE 1-Argentina's YPF eyes sale of electricity subsidiary stake to GE -media - Reuters News

{{20170714T153028.809+0000}}UPDATE 1-Argentina's YPF eyes sale of electricity subsidiary stake to GE -media(Adds details of YPF and GE activities in Argentina, background on YPF Energia Electrica subsidiary, including initial valuation)

BUENOS AIRES, July 14 (Reuters) - Argentina's state-run oil company, YPF SA , is in talks with General Electric Co to sell a 49 percent stake in its electricity generation subsidiary to the U.S. industrial conglomerate, local newspaper Clarin reported.

A YPF spokesman and a GE spokeswoman declined to comment on Friday. The two companies are partnering on several electricity projects in Argentina, Latin America's No. 3 economy, including plants in the province of Tucuman and near the Vaca Muerta shale field.

Last week, the two companies announced that they had secured $220 million in project financing from Citigroup and Credit Suisse , among others, for two jointly owned thermal power projects. [nFWN1JW0HH]

The value of the potential deal was unclear, and YPF does not publicize the value of the subsidiary, YPF Energia Electrica.

YPF launched the subsidiary in 2013 after acquiring assets from Argentina-based oil and gas company Pluspetrol, which spun off its electric generation business. At the time, the value of the spun-off assets amounted to $485 million, according to a YPF filing.

BREAKINGVIEWS-BlackRock opens new investment passivity front - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20170713T193537.346+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-BlackRock opens new investment passivity front(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Tom Buerkle

NEW YORK, July 13 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Larry Fink is opening a new front in the passive investment war on fund management. His firm, BlackRock , will sell exchange-traded funds using its own customized fixed-income indexes - and slash fees. It's a formula the money manager with $5.4 trillion of assets has used in equities to eat stock pickers' lunch. For an industry with little growth, the casualties of this latest assault may be widespread.

Low cost and ample liquidity have made ETFs wildly popular for everyone from retail investors to hedge funds. Most of the action has been in equities, though. They represent nearly 80 percent of the U.S. industry's $3 trillion of assets, compared with just under 18 percent for fixed income.

The reasons are structural. ETFs track everything from broad indexes like the S&P 500 to so-called smart beta products that follow specific sectors or style factors such as low volatility.

By contrast, the bond market is heavily fragmented. Companies like Apple and General Electric have dozens of bond issues outstanding but typically only one common share. There are a relative handful of widely followed bond indexes, like the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate, a broad gauge of investment-grade issues. BlackRock's iShares subsidiary uses that index for its largest bond ETF.

Now the firm is offering two new bond ETFs that track its own customized indexes: one focusing on investment-grade bonds paying higher than average yields and another on high-yield bonds with low default risk. BlackRock is betting products like these will shake up bond investing just as they have equities. For extra measure, it's slashing fees on its existing mortgage-backed securities ETF by two-thirds, hoping to benefit when the Federal Reserve begins to sell down its massive holdings later this year.

Fresh innovation by the world's largest manager, with a $71 billion market value, is more bad news for rivals. Assets under management rose 6 percent in the United States last year to some $33 trillion, but that was all market appreciation, according to Boston Consulting Group. Net new flows were slightly negative. The lack of growth and competition from passive vehicles has squeezed industry revenue margins by nearly a quarter over the past decade, to less than $27 for every $10,000 of assets.

Fidelity Investments, which has been hit hard by the indexing trend, said earlier this week it was firing several hundred employees. There will be more active victims before the passive onslaught runs its course.

CONTEXT NEWS

- BlackRock on July 13 said it was launching four new bond exchange-traded funds and cut fees on another in a bid to attract investors. The company's ETF subsidiary, iShares, said two of the new products - a high-yield bond ETF and an investment-grade bond fund - will track new indexes created by BlackRock. Until now the company's ETFs have tracked indexes created by third-party providers.

- The firm is also cutting the fee on its iShares MBS ETF, which tracks an index of mortgage-backed securities, to $9 a year for every $10,000 invested, from $27.

- "We have aspirations to be ubiquitous in every securities market," Martin Small, U.S. head of iShares, told Reuters.

INTERVIEW-Unsustainable oil services demand to hit U.S. shale boom -Halliburton - 路透新闻

{{20170711T121333.325+0000}}INTERVIEW-Unsustainable oil services demand to hit U.S. shale boom -HalliburtonBy Karolin Schaps

ISTANBUL, July 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. shale drilling boom is likely to ease next year as demand on the industry's service sector is unsustainable, Halliburton's business development head said on Tuesday.

The number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States rose to 763 last week, the highest in more than two years, showing that despite oil trading below $50 a barrel, shale oil explorers are still ramping up activity. [nL1N1JX19E]

Halliburton's Mark Richard, senior vice president for global business development and marketing, sees that count rising above 1,000 by the end of the year, but not beyond that.

"I think it might level off then. If our customers put too much out there, it's costing too much and putting too much demand on service companies to provide equipment and people," he told Reuters at an industry event in Istanbul.

Oil services companies cut back dramatically when demand for their products fell oil prices started falling in 2014 and it has taken them longer to readjust their output.

Richard said he sees 800-900 rigs as a more sustainable level in the medium term.

The increase in shale activity has been a boon for companies like Halliburton which supply equipment to the sector and Richard said he had been able to raise prices in the U.S. because of rising demand, but declined to give details.

However, appetite for oil and gas equipment is still weak outside of the Americas, Richard said.

"We've hit the bottom in the first half of this year. Our customers are getting excited about things but we don't yet see a lot of activity increasing."

Richard denied Halliburton was under additional pressure following the acquisition of rival Baker Hughes, which it failed to buy last year after regulatory opposition, by GE Oil & Gas last week. [nL1N1JU0N3]

GE-Baker Hughes will leapfrog Halliburton to become the world's second-biggest oil services company after Schlumberger .

"We're number 1 or 2 in every product line we work in today. That hasn't changed because GE bought Baker," he said

EXCLUSIVE-Pakistan sees bigger LNG profile; imports to surge by 2022 - 路透新闻

{{20170710T132321.946+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Pakistan sees bigger LNG profile; imports to surge by 2022* LNG imports could top 30 mln tonnes by 2022 - Abbasi

* Pakistan could be among top-5 importers globally

* Consortium to decide in Sept on $700 mln LNG terminal

* Pakistan in talks on govt-to-govt LNG supply deals

By Drazen Jorgic

ISLAMABAD, July 10 (Reuters) - Pakistan says it could become one of the world's top-five buyers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), with Petroleum Minister Shahid Abbasi predicting imports could jump more than fivefold as private companies build new LNG terminals.

Outlining Pakistan's ambitious plans - which, if fully implemented, could shake up the global LNG market - Abbasi told Reuters that imports could top 30 million tonnes by 2022, up from just 4.5 million tonnes currently.

Cheaper than fuel oil and cleaner burning than coal, LNG suits emerging economies seeking to bridge electricity shortfalls and support growth on tight budgets.

"Within five years, I don't see any reason why we should not be beyond 30 million tonnes (in annual LNG imports). We will be one of the top five markets in the world," Abbasi said.

That kind of jump would represent one of the fastest growth stories in the energy industry, comparable to what China has done in many commodities - but there are doubts whether Pakistan can achieve its ambitions, given the complexity and cost of expansion projects.

"It's always possible, but seems very difficult as they will need much more (regasification) capacity and downstream pipeline capacity," said Trevor Sikorski at Energy Aspects, a London-based industry market researcher. "There are infrastructural issues and financial issues."

"Still, it is one of the key LNG growth markets, and its demand will help tighten up the market that has threatened to lurch into over supply."

Abbasi said no one took Pakistan seriously after a decade of botched attempts to bring LNG to the country, but this has changed with the construction of new LNG terminals and gas plants. He said foreign suppliers are now arriving in Pakistan - where energy shortages have prompted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to promise he'll end the country's frequent blackouts.

"Before, we used to go out to talk to LNG suppliers. Now they're coming to us," Abbasi said.

"(LNG) is really what has saved the whole energy system. It has been a huge success in Pakistan and it will continue," he said after Sharif on Friday inaugurated a new Chinese-built LNG power plant that uses General Electric turbines.

GETTING CONNECTED

Pakistan built its first LNG terminal in 2015 and, after some delays, a second terminal is due to come online in October, doubling annual import capacity to about 9 million tonnes.

A consortium of Exxon Mobil , Total , Mitsubishi <8058.T>, Qatar Petroleum and Norway's Hoegh is expected to decide by September whether to build a third LNG terminal for about $700 million, Abbasi said.

Pakistan has dropped plans to finance up to two more terminals, as private companies have said they would finance these themselves and use Pakistan's existing gas network to sell directly to consumers.

"That's been the real success and that's where the growth will come from," Abbasi said, adding that about 10 million homes are linked to gas connections in Pakistan - a nation of around 200 million.

"In the last four years, we would have added two million additional connections. We are really ramping that up."

If Pakistan achieves its ambitious development goals, it could significantly erode market oversupply, which has helped pull down Asian LNG spot prices by more than 70 percent since 2014 to around $5 per million British thermal units (mmBtu).

Abbasi said Pakistan is in talks with Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Oman about government-to-government deals for up to three monthly LNG cargoes for its second terminal, which can import 600 million cubic feet of gas per day, equal to six cargoes a month.

"We have a basic idea of what the market is. So if we are able to better those prices through negotiated procurement, we will go with that, otherwise we might float some more tenders," Abbasi said.

Tenders for two of the terminal's six cargoes have already been won by trading house Gunvor and Italy's Eni , which have signed 5-year and 15-year deals, respectively. The contracts are worth about $5 billion over their lifetime. [nL8N1I43LO]

Qatar supplies most of the gas for Pakistan's first LNG terminal.

Abbasi said Pakistan is considering inviting private investors to build small-scale gas power plants to add another 3,000-4,000 megawatts to the network, on top of the three new LNG plants that will contribute 3,600 MW.

U.S. drillers add oil rigs, pace remains slow -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20170707T171035.245+0000}}U.S. drillers add oil rigs, pace remains slow -Baker HughesJuly 7 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms added oil rigs for a
24th week in the past 25 as the year-long drilling recovery
continues but the pace of additions has slowed in recent months
as crude prices declined despite OPEC-led efforts to end a
global supply glut.

Drillers added seven oil rigs in the week to July 7,
bringing the total count up to 763, the most since April 2015,
Baker Hughes energy services company  said in its
closely followed report on Friday.

That compares with 351 active oil rigs during the same week
a year ago. Drillers have added rigs in 54 of the past 58 weeks
since the start of June 2016.

The pace of those additions, however, has slowed over the
past few months with the decline in crude prices with the total
added over the past four weeks holding at six the lowest since
January.

U.S. crude futures  were trading around $44 per
barrel on Friday, putting the contract on track to fall for a
sixth week in the past seven, on data showing U.S. output
continues to rise, frustrating efforts by OPEC and other
producers to curb global oversupply. [O/R]

After agreeing in December to cut production by around 1.8
million barrels per day (bpd) for six months from January-June
2017, OPEC and other producers in late May agreed to extend
those cuts for another nine months through the end of March
2018. [nL8N1IR1C5]

U.S. oil production  rose 1 percent to 9.3
million bpd last week, correcting a drop in the previous week
that was due to one-off maintenance work and hurricane
shutdowns. [nZXN032300]

Analysts said U.S. shale companies would continue to drill
for more oil so long as crude prices are expected to rise in
future months.

Futures for the balance of 2017  were trading at
about $44.50 a barrel, while calendar 2018  was
fetching over $46 a barrel.

Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S.
investment bank Piper Jaffray, forecast the total oil and gas
rig count would average 887 in 2017, 1,108 in 2018 and 1,219 in
2019. Most wells produce both oil and gas.

That compares with an average of 824 so far in 2017, 509 in
2016 and 978 in 2015. If correct, Simmons' 2019 forecast would
be the most since 2014 when there were 1,862 active rigs. The
rig count peaked in 2012 at 1,919, according to Baker Hughes.

UPDATE 2-EU charges Merck KGaA, GE, Canon over merger rules - 路透新闻

{{20170706T152723.370+0000}}UPDATE 2-EU charges Merck KGaA, GE, Canon over merger rules(Adds detail about GE case)

By Foo Yun Chee

BRUSSELS, July 6 (Reuters) - General Electric , German drugmaker Merck KGaA , and Japan's Canon <7751.T> risk hefty fines after EU antitrust regulators accused them of providing misleading information during separate merger deals.

The European Commission said on Thursday that it had sent three separate charge sheets known as statements of objections to General Electric, Merck KGaA and Canon after investigations showed breaches of the bloc's merger rules.

While the charges will not affect the EU approvals of the deals, they could lead to fines of up to 1 percent of global revenue for Merck KGaA and General Electric, and up to 10 percent for Canon.

GE was charged with providing misleading research and development information related to its takeover of Danish rotor blade maker LM Wind this year which secured the EU green light in March.

GE's research involved an offshore turbine that generates more than 10 megawatts, larger than the 6-megawatt offshore version that GE currently sells and that it acquired in its purchase of power assets from Alstom.

The research was deemed relevant to both GE's purchase of LM Wind and Siemen's purchase of wind turbine maker Gamesa. The commission and GE are discussing the objections and potential fine, a process expected to last until September or October, according to people familiar with the case.

GE spokesman Jim Healy declined to comment on details of the information GE did not put in its initial application, but said the company "responded forthrightly" to the EU's concern and that GE is "having constructive cooperation" with the commission. "We expect that to continue."

Merck KGaA was accused of failing to provide information about an innovation project for chemicals during the merger review of its Sigma-Aldrich takeover approved in June 2015. As a result Honeywell International Inc acquired the technology only after a year-long delay.

The EU competition enforcer said Canon jumped the gun via a two-step warehousing move to acquire Toshiba Medical Systems Corp prior to securing regulatory approval. The deal was approved in September 2016.

"Companies have to give us full and accurate information, so we can take the right decisions. These decisions require a forward looking assessment," European Competition Commissioner Margaret Vestige told a news conference.

"That includes an assessment of the impact on innovation, an increasingly important part of the economy. And it should be the companies themselves telling us about their future strategies."

GE and Merck KGaA said they acted in good faith while Canon said it would respond in due course.

"There was no intent to mislead. When informed of the ECB's concerns, we acted quickly and openly to resolve the issue," GE said in a statement.

Vestige said the companies have until Aug. 30 and Sept. 1 to respond to the charges.

Facebook Inc was hit with a 110-million-euro ($125 million) fine in May for providing misleading information during the EU review of its messaging service WhatsApp buy in 2014.

($1 = 0.8787 euros)

Faced with possible EU fine, GE says acted in good faith  - 路透新闻

{{20170706T095304.847+0000}}Faced with possible EU fine, GE says acted in good faith BRUSSELS, July 6 (Reuters) - General Electric said on Thursday that it had acted in good faith to meet EU disclosure requirements, after the European Commission accused the company of providing misleading information during a merger deal.

"We believe we acted in good faith to meet the EC disclosure requirements and there was no intent to mislead," GE said in a statement.

The European Commission said it had sent three separate charge sheets, known as statements of objections, to Merck and Sigma-Aldrich, General Electric and Canon. [L8N1JX1UI]

While the charges will not affect the EU approvals of the deals, they could lead to fines up to 1 percent of global revenue for GE.

EU charges Merck KGaA, GE, Canon of misleading merger info - 路透新闻

{{20170706T093248.344+0000}}EU charges Merck KGaA, GE, Canon of misleading merger infoBRUSSELS, July 6 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators accused German drugmaker Merck KGaA , General Electric and Japan's Canon <7751.T> of providing misleading information during their merger deals, as regulators stepped up their crackdown on such practices.

The European Commission said it had sent three separate charge sheets known as statements of objections to Merck and Sigma-Aldrich, General Electric and Canon.

While the charges will not affect the EU approvals of the deals, they could lead to fines up to 1 percent of global revenue for Merck KGaA and General Electric, and up to 10 percent for Canon.

Merck KGaA was accused of failing to provide information about an innovation project for chemicals during the merger review of its Sigma-Aldrich takeover which was approved in June 2015.

GE was charged with providing misleading research and development information related to its takeover of LM Wind earlier this year.

The EU competition enforcer said Canon jumped the gun via a complex move and acquired Toshiba Medical Systems Corp prior to securing regulatory approval. The deal was approved in September 2016.

RPT-GE closes Baker Hughes deal, becomes No. 2 oilfield service provider - 路透新闻

{{20170703T144917.492+0000}}RPT-GE closes Baker Hughes deal, becomes No. 2 oilfield service provider(Repeats with no changes)

HOUSTON, July 3 (Reuters) - General Electric Co on Monday completed its buyout of Baker Hughes Inc , merging it with its own oil and gas equipment and services operations to create the world's second-largest oilfield service provider by revenue.

The new company, to be called "Baker Hughes, a GE company," will begin trading on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock ticker "BHGE."[nL4N1D13FG]

With headquarters in London and Houston, the combined company will have roughly $23 billion in annual revenue and offer oilfield gear including blowout preventers, pumps, drilling, chemicals, other products and services for oil producers in 120 countries.

For Baker Hughes, the deal helps it grow in size and become an even-more important player in the industry after antitrust concerns scuttled a tie-up last year with rival Halliburton Co . The GE deal vaults the merged business past Halliburton to rival only Schlumberger NV for dominance in the global oilfield service market.

For GE, the deal will help it focus more on the oil and gas sector, especially in North America, while shielding the parent company's earnings from the energy industry's boom and bust cycles. All of GE's oil and gas-related businesses will be folded into the new company, which will be 62.5 percent owned by GE. Baker shareholders will own the rest and receive a one-time, $17.50 dividend.

The deal, when announced last autumn, was predicated on a recovery in the oil price to $60 per barrel by 2019, an increase that now seems less likely with a glut of crude still circling the globe and keeping prices below $50.

Still, executives at the new company said the combination should help customers better perform if prices stay lower.

"The crystal ball for all of us is cloudy," said Lorenzo Simonelli, the company's chief executive, who will relocate to Houston from London.

"But we know energy requirements are still going to increase, globally. The fundamentals are there for energy."

Analysts and investors generally praised the deal as data analytics and other high-technology operations grow in demand among oil producers.[nL1N1J61GW]

"The GE-Baker deal will likely move the sector towards embracing Big Data in production optimization," said Jonathan Garrett of industry consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

The new company will have roughly 70,000 employees and be led by Simonelli and 14 senior executives. Only five of those executives will be legacy Baker Hughes employees, with most from GE.

The company will have access to GE's research and development facilities and be able to access GE's Predix software and analytics, Simonelli said.
