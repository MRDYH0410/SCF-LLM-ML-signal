CORRECTED-German project looks to home photovoltaic systems to help grid - 路透新闻

{{20170502T070047.496+0000}}CORRECTED-German project looks to home photovoltaic systems to help grid(Corrects to read solar battery maker, paragraph 1)

* Grid, panel firms in tie-up

* Virtually-linked solar batteries able to store, pool power

* IBM to deliver blockchain technology

* Could cut bills, solve problem of surplus wind power

FRANKFURT, May 2 (Reuters) - Grid operator Tennet and solar battery maker Sonnen GmbH have launched a pilot project that will tap home photovoltaic (PV) systems to help iron out imbalances on Germany's power network.

TenneT and Sonnen's e-Services subsidiary aim to sign up 6,000 household PV producers equipped with storage batteries by the end of May.

The project will be supported by blockchain technology from IBM , which works as an inexpensive transaction-processing system for tracking and recording encrypted information. [nL5N1GG2JT]

It holds potential to link up small energy "prosumers" and make them independent of centralised power providers.

"A home storage unit for solar power on its own is less valuable than one that can be used collectively," said Philipp Schroeder, director of sales and marketing at Bavaria-based Sonnen. [nL5N1FF2U9]

"We will be able to create a big virtual power line. That is revolutionary."

The two partners aim to initially pool 24 megawatts (MW) of power capacity for TenneT to use as a buffer for variable wind power.

"Balancing" power is so far handled mainly by traditional power plants while surplus wind power is often dealt with by curbing turbine output or throwing output away.

"We want to find out how we can reduce the waste of wind power by storing it in Sonnen batteries that we can access in the North while releasing power from solar energy stored at Sonnen batteries in southern Germany," said Urban Keussen, board chairman of the board at TenneT's German unit.

Germany currently subsidises renewable power producers with billions of euros a year, regardless of demand.

Because network development lags far behind, a lot of power is wasted because the north houses most of Germany's wind turbines whose output cannot reach industrial users in the south.

New transport lines, funded via grid fees charged to consumers, will take years to build. [nL8N18Z1SF]

Schroeder said he saw big potential for solar pv "communities" filling gaps in the meantime.

Germany has 15 million detached houses and 1.7 million photovoltaic units, but only 50,000 home storage units.

Should 10 percent of all households use solar plus storage in 10 years, that would create capacity of some 6 gigawatts of power, he said, equivalent to six nuclear plants.

RPT-Amazon's moves beyond retail get Wall Street thumbs up, for now - 路透新闻

{{20170501T110001.355+0000}}RPT-Amazon's moves beyond retail get Wall Street thumbs up, for now(Repeats story first published on Friday)

By Jeffrey Dastin

SAN FRANCISCO, April 28 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's ventures far beyond online retail, from cloud computing to movie making, are raising questions among corporate strategy experts about its focus.

The Seattle-based company wowed Wall Street again this week with a 23 percent jump in sales, pushing its shares to an all-time high. But there are concerns that if blockbuster growth stops, investors may come to regard the company more like a conglomerate stock - worth less than the sum of its pieces.

"High growth covers a lot of sins," said Harry Kraemer, a partner at private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners and a professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.

"Picture yourself running the company where one minute we're talking about how we're going to operate air cargo, and the next minute we're going to talk about artificial intelligence," he said. "I don't think it's sustainable."

So far, analysts have balked at the idea of calling Amazon a conglomerate because its businesses, although varied, all relate in some way to retail. Warehouses, trucks and planes bring packages to shoppers' doorsteps. Amazon Web Services sells the very cloud-computing services to enterprises that were built to meet the technology needs of Amazon.com.

"It's not like General Electric Co having financial services and making aircraft engines," Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian said.

Some initiatives, though, such as a television studio in Hollywood, seem further afield. Amazon says the video foray has allowed it to stream unique programming to members of its Prime shopping club, thereby increasing sign-ups for a program that encourages people to buy more goods, more often.

The financial success of the investment is difficult to assess. Revenue from Prime membership fees and other media subscriptions rose 49 percent in the first quarter to $1.9 billion, the company reported on Thursday. It does not disclose the costs of content for its Prime Video service, but they were estimated by an analyst to be more than $3 billion in 2016.

Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.

OUT OF FASHION

These days, conglomerates like GE are out of fashion in the corporate world. By a standard method of valuation - comparing a company's share price to its earnings per share - Amazon is worth about 10 times more than storied conglomerates Berkshire Hathaway Inc and United Technologies Corp .

Investors discount conglomerate stocks partly because diverse businesses are tough to manage, and partly because they believe the market allots money across industries better than a company can.

Indeed, a 2012 report by McKinsey & Co consultants found that conglomerates' revenue on average grew by 6.3 percent per year from 2002 to 2010, while "focused" companies grew by 9.2 percent.

Amazon has acknowledged its pursuits point in many directions, but stresses they are for the long-term, not for quick gains.

Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky rattled off a lengthy list of investments from retail in India to drones and artificial intelligence on the company's earnings conference call on Thursday, in an attempt to explain why its operating profit margin had thinned in North America.

"I know I'm drifting a bit from North America, but it's all part of the same theme," he told analysts.

For now at least, Amazon is being treated as a special case in part from the halo effect around its billionaire founder Jeff Bezos, the second-richest person alive. Many view Bezos as an entrepreneurial genius; he's already extended his reach beyond Amazon to start a space exploration company and purchase the Washington Post.

"Bezos gets a longer leash to wander around than the typical CEO," said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. But he was not convinced it was entirely justified.

"You hesitate to bet on this being the singular team that can do something that history has shown - over and over again - is really hard to do," said Gordon.

Referring to Walt Disney Co's CEO, he said: "Leave the movie making to Bob Iger."

Airbus reaches 35 A320neo deliveries for 2017 -sources - 路透新闻

{{20170426T150629.197+0000}}Airbus reaches 35 A320neo deliveries for 2017 -sourcesPARIS, April 26 (Reuters) - Airbus has delivered 35 A320neo aircraft so far this year, industry sources said on Tuesday, bringing to 103 the number of upgraded medium-haul jets placed in service since deliveries began in January last year.

The widely watched deliveries, which as of Monday totalled 9 so far in April, include the first aircraft for Icelandic budget carrier WOW air, which said on Tuesday it had taken the jet, powered by new LEAP engines from CFM International, under a leasing deal with Air Lease Corp .

Airbus aims to deliver some 200 of the A320neo jets, the latest version of Airbus's best-selling jet programme, this year. It is equipped with new fuel-saving engines from either CFM, jointly owned by General Electric and France's Safran , or U.S. rival Pratt & Whitney.

But deliveries have been hampered partly by problems with Pratt & Whitney's new Geared Turbofan engines.

Since A320neo deliveries began in 2016, Airbus has delivered 53 aircraft with Pratt & Whitney engines and 50 powered by CFM.

Pratt & Whitney parent United Technologies on Tuesday reaffirmed plans to deliver 350 to 400 Geared Turbofan engines to planemakers this year. [nL1N1HY0QP]

CFM's shareholders have said they are trimming forecasts for LEAP engine deliveries to Airbus and other planemakers in 2017 to 450-500 units from 500. [nL8N1HX6G7]

Airbus is expected to give an update on its own deliveries to airlines with quarterly earnings on Thursday.

UPDATE 1-Aero services lift Safran Q1 sales, talks with Zodiac continue - 路透新闻

{{20170425T185830.589+0000}}UPDATE 1-Aero services lift Safran Q1 sales, talks with Zodiac continue(Recasts, adds CEO comments, background)

By Cyril Altmeyer and Tim Hepher

PARIS, April 25 (Reuters) - French engine maker Safran reported higher-than-expected first-quarter revenue on Tuesday, buoyed by aerospace services, and told investors it was pushing ahead with plans to increase production of its LEAP civil jet engine.

Safran confirmed its 2017 outlook and said its adjusted revenue rose 5.5 percent to 3.982 billion euros ($4.36 billion).

It also said it continued to hold merger talks with French seats maker Zodiac Aerospace, after outlining an agreed offer in January, but declined to discuss how they were going or how it might go ahead with the two-pronged bid and merger plan.

Zodiac said on April 14 it would delay publication of its half-year results by a week from April 20, saying it had too much on its plate due to the talks. [nL8N1HM1AQ]

Reuters reported this month that Safran is exploring plans to lower its $9 billion bid for Zodiac Aerospace and may simplify its structure amid continued turmoil at the seats maker and pressure from its own shareholders. [nL8N1HM1I7]

British hedge fund TCI renewed criticism of the deal on Tuesday, saying Safran should suspend the talks pending an audit.

Safran Chief Executive Philippe Petitcolin said the company was "not distracted by this or that investor which chooses to express itself publicly".

Despite doubts raised by some investors over its plans to buy Zodiac, Safran shares have risen since the talks began.

Jefferies analyst Sandy Morris said this may be explained by a relatively trouble-free launch so far of the LEAP engine, co-produced with General Electric in the CFM International venture, as well as mishaps affecting rival engine maker Pratt & Whitney.

CFM still faces a major hurdle in executing plans for LEAP engine deliveries this year but there have been few problems so far and the first Boeing 737 MAX is on time, he wrote in a note.

Deliveries of Pratt & Whitney's engines, which compete with LEAP on the Airbus A320neo, have been slowed by various snags.

One expert said as many as 72 Pratt engines have been taken off wing for inspection or repairs since entering service.

As of mid-April, industry sources say Airbus had delivered a total of 100 A320neo aircraft since the fuel-efficient plane entered service in January 2016, including 53 fitted with Pratt & Whitney engines and the rest with CFM's LEAP engines.

CFM's shareholders have said they could deliver 450 to 500 LEAP engines this year instead of 500 stated earlier. [nL3N1HT3QI]

Petitcolin reaffirmed that CFM would be interested in a possible new twin-aisle, mid-market plane being studied by Boeing.

EXCLUSIVE-GE in talks with Irish firm on Chilean wind venture - sources  - 路透新闻

{{20170425T160338.662+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-GE in talks with Irish firm on Chilean wind venture - sources By Gram Slattery

SANTIAGO, April 25 (Reuters) - General Electric Co is in talks with an independent energy producer to make a significant move into wind power in Chile, two people with knowledge of the process told Reuters, as the conglomerate expands its global renewable footprint.

GE is in talks to provide turbines for wind farms to be developed by Ireland's Mainstream Renewable Power throughout Chile, according to the sources, who requested anonymity as the matter is private.

The U.S. company would likely take an equity stake in the projects, which would be financed with a mixture of equity and debt, according to one source.

The sources did not say what percentage of the project would be funded by each party. The wind farms being set up would require a total investment of up to $1.6 billion, Mainstream has said.

Mainstream declined to comment, and GE said it did not comment on rumors or speculation as a matter of company policy.

Renewable energy is booming in Chile, which has a tiny hydrocarbon industry but abundant wind and sun. Last year, European renewables firms, including Mainstream, won big in a large auction to supply Chile with power for two decades, beginning in 2021.[nL1N1AY18D]

There have been setbacks, such as delays in the construction of transmission lines and flagging demand from Chile's copper mines. Many of the auction winners are seeking deep-pocketed partners as they embark on project construction.

A partnership in Chile would mark the second such deal between Mainstream and GE. Last year, the two said they were teaming up for over $2 billion of investments in wind power in Vietnam, where GE would provide technology and a portion of the funding. [nL4N1D825C]

It would also come during a broader wind power push by GE. In October, the company said it will buy LM Wind Power, a maker of rotor blades used in wind turbines, for $1.65 billion.[nL4N1CH3LD]

Mainstream will build seven utility-scale wind farms to provide some 986 megawatts of power at a relatively low price of around $40 per megawatt-hour, according to the terms of the purchase agreement in last year's auction.

The sources did not specify if the GE partnership would apply to all seven wind farms.

The deal would mark the first significant move into Chilean renewables by GE. The company has long provided services to power generators in Chile, and in April 2016, GE bought into traditional energy in the nation by acquiring 75 percent of a gas-fired power plant.

UPDATE 3-Baker Hughes expects N.America revenue to rise in 2nd quarter - 路透新闻

{{20170425T150752.296+0000}}UPDATE 3-Baker Hughes expects N.America revenue to rise in 2nd quarter* Expects continued activity reduction in Gulf of Mexico

* Q1 loss of 24 cents per share vs est. loss of 21 cents

* Shares fall as much as 4.3 percent

(Adds details, comments)

April 25 (Reuters) - Baker Hughes Inc said on Tuesday it expects revenue from North America to rise in the current quarter from the first as oil producers drill more onshore wells, helping the oilfield service provider make up for a fall in demand in the Gulf of Mexico.

Oil producers are spending more on lucrative shale fields to take advantage of oil prices stabilizing at over $50 per barrel, while clamping down on expensive and time-consuming offshore projects.

"Activity growth in the U.S. onshore well construction product lines is forecast to more than offset the seasonal decline in Canada and ongoing activity reductions in the Gulf of Mexico," Chief Financial Officer Kimberly Ross said in a post-earnings call.

Larger rival Halliburton Co said on Monday oil producers were completing nearly as many wells as they were drilling, leading to revenue and margin growth in its completion and production unit. [nL4N1HW3T4]

Market leader Schlumberger said on Friday that it was redeploying service capacity and technical support resources from the Gulf of Mexico to other markets.

Shares of Baker Hughes, which reported a bigger-than-expected loss on Tuesday, fell as much as 4.3 percent to $56.15, before paring losses to trade down marginally.

The company, which is being acquired by General Electric Co , said quarterly revenue fell 15.3 percent to $2.26 billion in the first quarter ended March 31.

Analysts' on average had expected revenue of $2.27 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

In contrast, Schlumberger's first quarter revenue rose 5.7 percent and Halliburton's 1.9 percent.

Baker Hughes is much more exposed than Halliburton to international markets, where activity and pricing for oilfield services has remained persistently low.

About 31 percent of Baker Hughes' total revenue comes from North America, with operations in the Gulf of Mexico account for 15 percent of its revenue from the region.

Net loss attributable to Baker Hughes narrowed to $129 million, or 30 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $981 million, or $2.22 per share, a year earlier. [nBw7hQ3Xya]

According to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, the company lost 24 cents per share, on an adjusted basis. Analysts' on average had estimated a loss of 21 cents.

GE said last week the merger of its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes remained on track to close in mid-2017.

Up to Monday's close, Baker Hughes shares had fallen 9.7 percent this year, compared to a 8.8 percent decline in globally-traded Brent crude prices .

* Engineers identify two-part solution for crucial gear design

* Boeing says no decision taken, discussion of launch premature

* Design decision has direct bearing on battle for jet sales

(Adds Boeing shares, details of operating cost target)

By Tim Hepher

PARIS, April 25 (Reuters) - Boeing is nearing a decision to launch a larger version of its 737 workhorse jet within two months to counter strong sales of the Airbus A321neo, after a breakthrough on the design for one of its parts, industry sources said.

The 737 MAX 10 would narrow the gap between the 178-220 seat 737-9, which first flew this month, and the 185-240 seat A321neo, which dominates the top end of a market for narrowbody jets worth $2 trillion over 20 years. [nL3N1HL2YZ]

Boeing has been studying how to solve a tricky problem with the design of the plane's landing gear, without adding cost or delaying a 2020 target for first deliveries.

The sources said a solution had been found and that Boeing was talking more deliberately to airlines about launching the 737-10 at the Paris Airshow in June. Boeing is said to anticipate a total market of 1,000 of the planes.

"Boeing is actively engaged in discussions with customers about the 737 MAX 10X," a spokesman said. "No decision has been made on the airplane and any discussion on timing of a possible launch would be speculative."

Boeing shares were up slightly in early trading.

Reuters reported last year that the 737-10 marks a tactical response to the A321neo, while Boeing works on strategic plans for a 220-260-seat twin-aisle, mid-market jet. [nL8N18Q0PX]

But it has produced a puzzle so tricky that Boeing has asked for help from its combat jet experts to design a space-saving gear for the 737-10.

A solution is needed because the 737-10 will be longer than the 737-9 to make room for about 12 extra seats. The landing gear must become taller too or the tail could scrape the runway.

Anxious to avoid costly changes to the rest of the plane and stay on schedule, Boeing aims to make the gear longer only when needed, but small enough to fit in the 737's existing wheel bay.

It has not made final decisions but is testing an advanced proposal to allow the 737 to effectively sit back on its heels as it leaves the runway.

This is what aerospace engineers call a "semi-levered" design and is a nod to two bigger jets: the 777 and 787-10.

In a further twist, the gear would lengthen telescopically for the 737-10 to charge down the runway. Afterwards, it would shrink again to retract into the same space.

COMPETITION IMPACT

Drawing-board decisions like these feed directly into the battle for jet sales.

A longer gear allows pilots to use the same take-off angle rather than easing off to avoid striking the runway with the tail of the longer jet. Shallower take-offs need more runway, limiting the number of airports served and restricting sales.

Airbus, which declined comment, will try to persuade potential 737-10 buyers that it is little different from the slow-selling 737-9. It is meanwhile said to be working on its own improvements to the A320 family codenamed A320neo-plus.

Market sources say Boeing is offering 5 percent lower costs per seat than the A321neo for the 737-10. Some experts are more cautious on operating costs, leaving jetmakers to slug it out over two other important drivers: range and performance.

Boeing decided against using a bigger engine to boost those features and is gambling that some airlines will prefer extra seats and fly the 737-10 mainly on short routes.

Although reports have focused on the clash between the A321neo and 737-9/10, industry sources say it's not just the top end of the narrowbody market that drives the new design.

Because most carriers stick to one jet family, they say Boeing seems worried the A321neo's success could prompt fleet decisions that weaken the smaller 737 MAX 8. The 737-10 would thus be an extra rampart to defend Boeing's biggest cash cow.

"It's a defensive move. Boeing wants to prevent the A321neo being a Trojan Horse in its own fleet," one strategist said.

EXCLUSIVE-Boeing near decision to launch 737-10 jet -sources - 路透新闻

* Engineers test two-part solution for crucial gear design

* Boeing says no decision taken, discussion of timing premature

* Design decision has direct bearing on battle for jet sales

(Adds comments on sales impact, strategy behind new variant)

By Tim Hepher

PARIS, April 25 (Reuters) - Boeing is nearing a decision to launch a larger version of its 737 workhorse jet within two months to counter strong sales of the Airbus A321neo, after a breakthrough on the design for one of its parts, industry sources said.

The 737 MAX 10 would narrow the gap between the 178-220 seat 737-9, which first flew this month, and the 185-240 seat A321neo, which dominates the top end of a market for narrowbody jets worth $2 trillion over 20 years. [nL3N1HL2YZ]

Boeing has been studying how to solve a tricky problem with the design of the plane's landing gear, without adding cost or delaying a 2020 target for first deliveries.

The sources said a two-part technical solution is being tested and that Boeing is negotiating with airlines with the aim of launching the 737-10 at the Paris Airshow in June. Boeing is said to anticipate a total market of 1,000 of the planes.

"Boeing is actively engaged in discussions with customers about the 737 MAX 10X," a spokesman said.

"No decision has been made on the airplane and any discussion on timing of a possible launch would be speculative."

Reuters reported last year that the 737-10 marks a tactical response to the A321neo, while Boeing works on strategic plans for a 220-260-seat twin-aisle, mid-market jet. [nL8N18Q0PX]

But it has produced a puzzle so tricky that Boeing has asked for help from its combat jet experts to design a space-saving gear for the 737-10.

A solution is needed because the 737-10 will be longer than the 737-9 to make room for about 12 extra seats. The landing gear must become taller too or the tail could scrape the runway.

Anxious to avoid costly changes to the rest of the plane and stay on schedule, Boeing aims to make the gear longer only when needed, but small enough to fit in the 737's existing wheel bay.

It has not made final decisions but is testing an advanced proposal to allow the 737 to effectively sit back on its heels as it leaves the runway.

This is what aerospace engineers call a "semi-levered" design and is a nod to two bigger jets: the 777 and 787-10.

In a further twist, the gear would lengthen telescopically for the 737-10 to charge down the runway. Afterwards, it would shrink again to retract into the same space.

COMPETITION IMPACT

Drawing-board decisions like these feed directly into the battle for jet sales.

A longer gear allows pilots to use the same take-off angle rather than easing off to avoid striking the runway with the tail of the longer jet. Shallower take-offs need more runway, limiting the number of airports served and restricting sales.

Airbus, which declined comment, is likely to try to persuade potential 737-10 buyers that it is little different from the slow-selling 737-9. Sources say it is meanwhile working on its own improvements to the A320 family codenamed A320neo-plus.

Experts say more capacity could put costs per seat of the 737-10 in the same ballpark as the A321neo, leaving jetmakers to slug it out over range and performance.

Boeing decided against using a bigger engine to boost those two features. It is gambling that some airlines will prefer extra seats and fly the 737-10 mainly on short routes.

Although reports have focused on the clash between the A321neo and 737-9/10, industry sources say it's not just the top end of the narrowbody market that drives the new design.

Because most carriers stick to one jet family, they say Boeing seems worried the A321neo's success could prompt fleet decisions that weaken the smaller 737 MAX 8, its main cash cow.

"It's a defensive move. Boeing wants to prevent the A321neo being a Trojan Horse in its own fleet," one strategist said.

ANALYSIS-Ready for take-off? China's answer to Boeing now just needs to sell - 路透新闻

{{20170424T230005.758+0000}}ANALYSIS-Ready for take-off? China's answer to Boeing now just needs to sell* COMAC C919 expected to make maiden flight within weeks

* Interest so far mainly from domestic Chinese airlines

* But, in future, C919 may challenge Boeing, Airbus

By Brenda Goh and Tim Hepher

SHANGHAI/PARIS, April 25 (Reuters) - When China unveiled an historic order for its first large commercial jetliner at a national air show in 2010, Western journalists were kept away, and only local media were allowed to witness a major turning point in China's aviation ambitions.

The COMAC C919 jet is expected to stage its maiden flight in the coming weeks, and foreign media and potential buyers will be invited in force - illustrating how Beijing is adjusting to competition for a slice of global jet sales worth $2 trillion over the next 20 years.

But after three years of delays and almost a decade in development, China's answer to the Boeing 737 and its state-owned designers face a daunting phase: selling the jet abroad in a market dominated by Boeing and Airbus .

"They will be trying to compete on price against people who are building aircraft at a much faster pace and with more experience, so there's a risk of getting bled dry," said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst at Virginia-based Teal Group.

Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) has some cards to play: its plane has Western engines and avionics coupled with a new design; it's rolling out a pilot training programme, expanding international staff and has strong, behind-the-scenes backing from Beijing, industry executives say.

And though still unproven, COMAC could be the single biggest threat over the coming decades to the dominance of Boeing and Airbus, both in China's own huge aviation market and, longer-term, overseas. The C919 is the first step to this.

Beijing's backing for the single-aisle plane gives COMAC a springboard in the world's fastest-growing domestic market, even though the company acknowledges much bigger hurdles abroad.

"You can't compare us to Boeing or Airbus, they're in a different strategic stage... We took half a century to solve the first strategic issue (of plane development), it will also take many years to solve the second (market) problem," said Jeff Cheng, a spokesman for COMAC. "After the first flight, we have to focus and research on how to improve the plane's and COMAC's market competitiveness."

Eric Chen, president of Airbus Commercial Aircraft China, welcomed the competition from COMAC, and a China-based spokesman for Boeing congratulated the company on developing the C919.

GLOBAL SUPPORT NETWORK

The C919 has chalked up 570 firm orders and commitments from 23 customers, mainly Chinese state-backed airlines and leasing companies, but says it is not able to give a breakdown.

In comparison, the latest version of the Boeing 737 had more than 3,000 firm orders before it flew last January.

Those types of numbers from the two big global planemakers come after decades of trimming costs and honing marketing pitches. The two have global support networks able to respond whenever a jet breaks down just about anywhere, and the number of jets flying makes it easier for airlines to raise loans to buy them.

While Chinese financiers have muscled into the global aviation arena, COMAC has a relatively low-key presence at international air shows and has said the C919 will initially be aimed at the domestic market. But there are signs it's adopting a more outward-facing approach.

While operating manuals for COMAC's smaller ARJ21 regional jet, which took its first flight in 2007, were written in Mandarin, the C919's will be in English to support sales.

COMAC's sales and support networks - it has at least 50 people in its sales and marketing departments, says Cheng - are, however, a fraction of those at Boeing and Airbus.

Still, COMAC's home advantage is significant as Chinese airlines are likely to drive airplane demand over the next two decades, buying nearly 7,000 planes - mostly from Boeing and Airbus.

"Their sales person is the government," said a Chinese airline executive, who didn't want to be named for risk of damaging business relationships. "As long as the government tells the state airlines to purchase planes, that will happen."

Airline executives say the first flight is when COMAC can realistically start discussing deposits and firming up customers, even if the plane still faces years of testing.

"We haven't placed a deposit; at the moment it's intentions," said Che Shanglun, chairman of Xiamen Airlines, a subsidiary of China Southern Airlines <600029.SS><1055.HK>, which has committed to buying up to 50 of the 158-seat C919s.

"We signed for 50, but we actually want to buy 30. We have to see if they're able to produce it... They (COMAC) are very enthusiastic, they meet us every month and send us updates."

HOW SAFE IS IT?

Executives at two Chinese airlines which have not placed orders for the aircraft said they wanted to see the C919's safety record, as well as the creation of a global support team.

The safety certification of the new plane - which state media says will have a catalogue price tag of around $50 million, less than half that of a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 - could be among the biggest issues for the C919 internationally.

Having a plane certified to fly commercially is tough enough even for Western jetmakers as aircraft become more complex and supply chains expand. There is still uncertainty over approvals needed for the C919 to secure a foothold beyond China, with the United States and European Union having the most influence.

Although the EU has agreed to recognise some of the checks carried out by China, it is expected to insist on some of its own tests before issuing a safety certificate and is trying to understand where discrepancies between the two systems lie.

"We are just at the start of the process," said Patrick Ky, executive director of the European Aviation Safety Agency.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Without Western approvals, China would only be able to sell to countries that accept its certification standards. Zimbabwe, Bolivia and Tajikistan have previously bought Chinese planes.

Without Western certification, "sales of the aircraft in developed economies and many developing economies will be difficult to impossible," said Bradley Perrett, a veteran China watcher at Aviation Week.

The C919's only real foreign buyer so far is leasing firm GE Capital Aviation Services, whose parent General Electric co-built the plane's engine with France's Safran .

"Only once our plane enters the market and is tested can we see what gaps it has," Cheng said.

UPDATE 1-China plans maiden flight of C919 jetliner around May 5 - sources - 路透新闻

{{20170424T201420.850+0000}}UPDATE 1-China plans maiden flight of C919 jetliner around May 5 - sources(Adds details)

PARIS/SHANGHAI, April 24 (Reuters) - China plans to stage the maiden flight of its C919 passenger jet on or around May 5, two people familiar with the project said.

Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC) has completed ground-testing and is preparing the aircraft for its much-delayed debut flight, which could provide an historic boost to China's efforts to compete with global aircraft makers.

The C919's maiden flight has been delayed at least twice since 2014 due to production issues.

China first gave the world a glimpse of the 158-seat plane in November 2015 at a roll-out ceremony in Shanghai.

The aircraft is a symbol of China's ambitions to break into a duopoly enjoyed by Western giants Airbus and Boeing . Russia is developing a similar jet.

China Eastern Airlines is the launch customer for the plane, which is powered by engines from French-U.S. supplier CFM International, jointly owned by General Electric and Safran.

In another sign of China's growing presence in aviation, its safety certification authority will host foreign regulators and suppliers at a conference organised jointly with European safety authorities in Shanghai this week.

A third source said that COMAC had initially aimed to fly the C919 to coincide with the first such Chinese-European safety event but that the date had slipped into the first week of May.

By Alwyn Scott

NEW YORK, April 24 (Reuters) - GE Power, a division of General Electric Co , has signed a services deal with Algerian utility Sonelgaz SPE valued at more than $3 billion, the largest services agreement ever for GE Power and one that creates hundreds of jobs in Algeria, GE said on Monday.

Under the 20-year contract with the subsidiary of Sonelgaz, GE will train more than 1,000 workers in Algeria and create about 300 jobs through its Algerian suppliers and its own operations there, Steve Bolze, chief executive officer of GE Power, said in an interview.

The agreement builds on GE's growing footprint in Algeria, where it has had a presence for four decades. GE Power, based in Schenectady, New York, signed a $2.7 billion deal with Sonelgaz SPE in 2013 to supply large gas turbines and related technology to nine power plants in the country.

In 2014, GE signed a $400 million agreement to build an industrial complex to produce gas and steam turbines under a joint venture with Sonelgaz called General Electric Algeria Turbines. The complex is due to come on line next year, instead of 2017 as originally planned, Bolze said. It is due to deliver its first turbine in 2019.

GE was able to expand the latest deal after its acquisition of Alstom's power and grid businesses in 2015. "The service agreement, and digital, will cover the total plant, everything from the gas turbines to the rest of the equipment," Bolze said.

The agreement calls for GE to provide long-term maintenance and operations services for 10 power plants in Algeria.

GE also will install gas technology upgrades that increase the plants' power output by 420 megawatts and will deploy its industrial internet software applications using its Predix operating system, GE Power's second-largest such agreement, it said. The agreement is expected to save Sonelgaz $2 billion in gas costs over 20 years, GE said.

The agreement also positions GE for work with Sonelgaz on maintenance and operations services in other parts of Africa.

GE will use its ALGESCO joint venture with Sonelgaz to repair turbines and set up a repair center. GE will also use Sonelgaz affiliate MEI to make replacement parts for GE turbines, GE said.

NEW YORK, April 24 (Reuters) - GE Power, a division of General Electric Co , has signed a services deal with a subsidiary of Algerian utility Sonelgaz valued at more than $3 billion, the largest such agreement ever for GE Power, GE said on Monday.

Under the 20-year contract with Sonelgaz SPE, GE will provide long-term maintenance and operations services for 10 power plants in Algeria, which produce 11 gigawatts of power, about 70 percent of Algeria's electricity, GE said.

The agreement is expected to save Sonelgaz $2 billion in gas costs over 20 years, GE said.

GE will install gas technology upgrades that increase the plants' power output by 420 megawatts and will deploy its industrial internet software applications using its Predix operating system, GE Power's second-largest such agreement, it said.

GE was able to expand the deal after its acquisition of Alstom's power and grid businesses in 2015. "The service agreement, and digital, will cover the total plant, everything from the gas turbines to the rest of the equipment," Steve Bolze, chief executive officer of GE Power, said in an interview.

The agreement builds on GE's growing footprint in Algeria, where it has had a presence for four decades. GE Power, based in Schenectady, New York, signed a $2.7 billion deal with Sonelgaz SPE in 2013 to supply large gas turbines and related technology to nine power plants in the country.

In 2014, GE signed a $400 million agreement to build an industrial complex to produce gas and steam turbines under a joint venture with Sonelgaz called General Electric Algeria Turbines. The complex is due to come on line next year, instead of 2017 as originally planned, Bolze said. It is due to deliver its first turbine in 2019.

The agreement also includes specialized training for 1,000 field technicians, and positions GE for possible work with Sonelgaz on maintenance and operations services in other parts of Africa.

The company will use its existing ALGESCO joint venture with Sonelgaz to repair turbines and set up a repair center. GE will also use Sonelgaz affiliate MEI to make replacement parts for GE turbines, GE said.

GUIDE TO EU MERGER PROCESS

DEADLINES:

The European Commission has 25 working days after a deal is filed for a first-stage review. It may extend that by 10 working days to 35 working days, to consider either a company's proposed remedies or an EU member state's request to handle the case.

Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90 additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working days.

SIMPLIFIED:

Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved.

GE beefs up additive manufacturing, scouts for acquisitions - 路透新闻

{{20170424T110736.075+0000}}GE beefs up additive manufacturing, scouts for acquisitionsHANOVER, Germany, April 24 (Reuters) - General Electric is beefing up its additive manufacturing business with an investment of more than 100 million euros ($109 million) in Germany and continues to be alert for acquisition opportunities, the head of the business said.

The maker of jet engines, power plants and other industrial equipment, General Electric last year bought a majority in Swedish 3D printer maker Arcam and privately held German 3D printing firm Concept Laser at a total cost of about $1.3 billion. [nL8N1CX2DK]

Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, saves money on material costs and time from design to manufacturing by printing objects in layers directly from a computer design instead of cutting them out of blocks of material.

With last year's acquisitions, GE owns two of the five principal 3D printing technologies - powder and electron-beam. "Our goal is to get into all of the these," GE Additive chief Mohammad Ehteshami told reporters on Monday.

Asked whether this could be achieved through organic growth alone, he said: "We are always studying organic and inorganic possibilities... Strategically, there are inorganic plays we would not be smart not to do."

GE already 3D prints several aircraft parts and aims to turn the additive manufacturing business, currently still a part of GE aviation, into a $1 billion external sales business by 2020.

"I have a belief that you'll be able to print the whole jet engine," Ehteshami told reporters at the Hannover Messe industrial trade fair.

He said the group had invested around $1.5 billion in 3D printing technology over the past decade, not including last year's acquisitions.

GE announced an investment of 100 million euros into the newly acquired Concept Laser site in Lichtenfels, Bavaria, where the number of employees should rise to 300 by the end of this year from 200.

It also said it would open a new additive manufacturing customer training and support centre in Munich, planned to be the first of several worldwide aimed at gaining greater exposure for the technology, at a cost of 15 million euros. ($1 = 0.9203 euros)

GE Power division nears $3 bln services deal in Algeria -source - 路透新闻

UPDATE 4-GE shares fall on cash, business worries though profit beats - 路透新闻

{{20170421T175930.371+0000}}UPDATE 4-GE shares fall on cash, business worries though profit beats(Adds details from interviews with CFO, analyst)

By Alwyn Scott

NEW YORK, April 21 (Reuters) - General Electric Co reported quarterly sales and adjusted earnings results that beat analysts estimates on Friday, but its shares fell on concerns about some of its industrial businesses and its cash outflow.

The maker of jet engines, power plants and other industrial equipment also reported a negative $1.6 billion in cash flow from industrial operating activities compared with a negative $600 million it expected for the quarter due to a $1.3 billion increase in working capital and the timing of bills to customers.

Investors have been watching cash flow as an indicator of GE's operating performance, and GE said it still expects to hit its cash target of $12 billion to $14 billion for the full year.

Shares were down 2.3 percent at $29.57 in afternoon trading, making it the second-biggest decliner on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

"There was immediate disappointment that cash came in low," said Deane Dray, analyst at RBC Capital markets. Analysts asked numerous questions about it on the conference call and "it gave investors a reason not to feel good about the quarter."

The company also raised concern by giving itself wiggle room to deliver fewer LEAP aircraft engines this year, a key risk for the company. It said the range for the year was 450 to 500 engines, instead of nearly 500 it stated earlier.

"It is notable that GE is taking a more cautious slant by backing away from a firm target of "500," Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard said.

But GE Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein said in an interview there was no change in the LEAP forecast.

"We're not changing our view on our ability to deliver the LEAP engine this year for Boeing and Airbus," Bornstein said.

GE shipped 81 engines in the first quarter and expects to ship 100 in the second quarter, he said, adding: "There's no delays to customers whatsoever."

GE beat analysts estimates for adjusted earnings and revenue, even though revenue fell 1 percent to $27.66 billion, due to lower sales in its oil-and-gas and lighting businesses. Analysts expected $26.26 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Adjusted earnings of 21 cents a share were unchanged from a year ago and beat analyst estimates of 17 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

GE said industrial organic revenue, which is from continuing businesses, grew 7 percent in the quarter, a strong showing according to analysts. Industrial operating profit margins rose by 1.3 percent points, also more than analysts expected, and ahead of the 1 percentage point forecast for the year.

Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt noted a 10 percent rise in quarterly orders and said the world economy was "an attractive environment for GE."

"We see global growth accelerating, while the U.S. continues to improve," Immelt said on the conference call, adding that growth in China, Southeast Asia, Latin America and Africa this year were all "stronger than last year."

Separately, European engineering groups ABB Ltd and Schneider Electric SE are competing for GE's solutions division, which could fetch as much as $3 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. [nL1N1HT0V8]

ABB, Schneider Electric bid for General Electric unit -sources - 路透新闻

{{20170421T164556.467+0000}}ABB, Schneider Electric bid for General Electric unit -sourcesBy Greg Roumeliotis

April 21 (Reuters) - European engineering groups ABB Ltd and Schneider Electric SE are competing for General Electric Co's industrial solutions division, which could fetch as much as $3 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.

The divestiture would represent a key step by GE to focus on its core businesses and improve its operational performance, amid pressure from Nelson Peltz's activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management.

ABB and Schneider Electric are through to the second round of bidding for GE's industrial solutions business, a provider of primarily electrical equipment, the sources said this week. Schneider Electric is looking for a partner to break up the business should its bid prevail, in order to address any antitrust concerns, the sources added.

Private equity firms, including KKR & Co LP , Clayton Dubilier & Rice LLC, Warburg Pincus LLC and Onex Corp , are also in the running, according to the sources.

The sources asked not to be identified because details of the sale process are confidential. Schneider Electric declined to comment, while GE, ABB, KKR, Clayton Dubilier & Rice, Warburg Pincus and Onex did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

GE reported quarterly sales and adjusted earnings results on Friday that beat analysts estimates, but its shares fell on concerns about some of its industrial businesses. [nL3N1HT3QI]

The maker of jet engines, power plants and other industrial equipment also reported a negative $1.6 billion in cash flow from industrial operating activities compared with a negative $600 million it expected for the quarter due to a $1.3 billion increase in working capital and the timing of bills to customers.

Last month, GE agreed to sell its industrial water treatment business to French waste and water group Suez SA and Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec for 3.2 billion euros ($3.4 billion). [nL5N1GL5WQ]

UPDATE 2-U.S. and Indonesia seek to cut trade and investment barriers - 路透新闻

{{20170421T053527.123+0000}}UPDATE 2-U.S. and Indonesia seek to cut trade and investment barriers* Indonesia on Trump's trade review list; US firms in firing line

* Pence cites barriers in IP, regulations, local content

* Pence witnesses signing of $10 bln in agreements with US firms

* VP says US working to combat terrorism with Indonesia

* Trump to visit Southeast Asia in November for summits

(Wraps up visit, Pence leaves for Australia, edits throughout)

By Roberta Rampton and Eveline Danubrata

JAKARTA, April 21 (Reuters) - Indonesia and the United States agreed on Friday to find ways to reduce barriers to U.S. companies operating in Southeast Asia's largest economy, visiting U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Jakarta's investment chief said.

The Trump administration has put Indonesia on a list of 16 countries whose trade surpluses with the United States will be put under review. A series of disputes between Indonesia and American firms has also ruffled ties.

"We will work with President Jokowi to reduce barriers to trade and investments and to create a truly level playing field where all our businesses have equal opportunity and market access," Pence said. Jokowi is the nickname of Indonesia's President Joko Widodo.

"The president and I spoke about that very candidly and very respectfully," Pence told a roundtable discussion with business executives in Jakarta before flying to Australia on the last leg of his 10-day Asia-Pacific tour.

Indonesia's investments barriers include a lack of intellectual property protection, insufficient transparency with regulations and requiring local content for manufactured goods sold in the Indonesian market, Pence said.

Indonesia's Investment Coordinating Board chief Tom Lembong said Widodo agreed "we still have too many regulations, too many barriers to trade, and these are bad for local and international industries".

"I'm optimistic because President Jokowi and President Trump are both lifelong business people, and I think they are very focused on the practical issues that hinder business and investment," Lembong told Reuters. "I feel that the Trump administration and the Jokowi administration are on the same wavelength."

Lembong said Indonesia needs both investment and imports from the United States, "especially productivity-enhancing products and services. You need imports to boost exports."

$10 BILLION AGREEMENTS

Neither side disclosed any discussions about the disputes Indonesia has had with American companies of late.

Over the past six months, Indonesia has wrestled with mining giant Freeport McMoRan , demanding the company divest 51 percent of its shares in its Papua-based gold and copper mine, and has demanded that Google Inc. settle unpaid taxes and fines of more than $400 million. Jakarta also scrubbed JP Morgan from its list of primary bond dealers after what was deemed a negative research report.

Pence did, however, witness the signing of more than $10 billion in memoranda of understanding with U.S. companies in Indonesia on Friday.

Among the 11 agreements were ones by Exxon Mobil to sell liquefied natural gas to Pertamina, Lockheed Martin to provide upgrades to the Indonesian Air Force's F-16s, and General Electric to develop electrical infrastructure in Indonesia.

"We think there are opportunities to clear open the way for American companies to participate more greatly in Indonesia," Pence said, adding the agreements would "draw our nations closer together and benefit both our people."

COUNTER-TERRORISM COOPERATION

Pence said in opening remarks to the roundtable that an attack in central Paris is the latest reminder terrorism can strike anywhere at anytime, and the United States would not relent in its efforts to end terrorism.

"The people of Indonesia can be confident in the wake of this latest attack: We will not relent in our effort to end terrorism and the threat it presents to both of our peoples," Pence said.

A French policeman was shot dead and two others were wounded in central Paris on Thursday night in an attack carried out days before presidential elections and quickly claimed by the Islamic State militant group.

Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority nation, has itself been hit by a series of deadly attacks over the past 15 years, led by militants affiliated with al Qaeda and more recently by Islamic State.

Pence said Washington would continue working with Indonesia to combat terrorism. On Thursday, Pence toured the Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta, Southeast Asia's largest, and said Indonesia's moderate form of Islam should serve as an example to other nations.

Indonesia has expressed concern about the Trump administration's proposal to bar entry to citizens of some predominantly Muslim nations. That plan, however, remains stalled in courts.

Pence on Thursday announced Trump would visit Southeast Asia in November for an annual series of regional summits. They include the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Vietnam and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in the Philippines.

Industrial conglomerate General Electric Co is scheduled to post results for the first quarter. Investors are looking for the company to cut costs and lift profits to hit the targets it set out in March after discussions with activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management.

Schlumberger Ltd, the world's No.1 oilfield services provider, is expected to post a lower first-quarter profit, hurt by the cost of reactivating idled rigs and equipment. However, revenue is expected to rise as improved drilling activity in North America helped Schlumberger roll back discounts offered during the downturn in oil prices. Investors will be looking for comments on the recovery in international and offshore markets.

World finance leaders will gather for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington, where the case against protectionist trade policies is likely to be a major theme. The IMF in particular has sounded warnings against U.S. President Donald Trump's plans to shrink U.S. trade deficits with potential measures to restrict imports, arguing in its latest economic forecasts that protectionist policies would crimp global growth that is starting to gain traction.

Honeywell International Inc, a diversified manufacturer that makes aircraft parts, catalysts and absorbents used for petroleum refining, is expected to report lower revenue for the first quarter, hurt by weakness in its aerospace business. Sales in the business have been hurt in the past year due to a slowing business jet market. However, Honeywell has forecast its full year organic sales growth rate would improve for the first time in three years, partly helped by the stabilizing oil and gas market. Investors will look for an update on 2017 financial forecast.

Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari, the lone dissenter at last month's Fed policy meeting and one of the most dovish members of the US central bank, participates in a question-and-answer session as part of the Hamline University Community Economic Development Symposium. With the Fed's communications blackout beginning on Saturday, Kashkari's comments will be among the last from Fed policymakers ahead of their meeting in May. (0930/1330)

On the economic front, data is expected to show March existing home sales expanded slightly to 5.6 million, from 5.48 million in February. Markit's PMI flash data for April is expected to show a slightly higher reading.

Canada's annual inflation rate is likely to have slipped to 1.8 percent in March from 2 percent in February, data from Statistics Canada is expected to show. (0830/1230)

Interpublic Group of Companies Inc is expected to report its fourth consecutive rise in quarterly revenue, helped this time by U.S. companies allocating larger budgets for ad spending in the first quarter.

Aviation electronics maker Rockwell Collins Inc is expected to report strong revenue for the second quarter, helped by its $6.4 billion acquisition of aircraft interior maker B/E Aerospace Inc. Investors will watch for an update on full year financial forecast.

Mexico's national statistics agency will release unemployment data, which is expected to show the jobless rate dropped to 3.30 percent in March, from 3.40 percent the previous month. (0900/ 1300)

RPT-Saudi Arabia pushes ahead with renewable drive to diversify energy mix - 路透新闻

{{20170418T070002.765+0000}}RPT-Saudi Arabia pushes ahead with renewable drive to diversify energy mix(Repeats April 17 story with no changes)

By Rania El Gamal, Reem Shamseddine and Katie Paul

RIYADH, April 17 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia aims to produce 10 percent of its power from renewable sources in the next six years as it pushes ahead with a multi-billion-dollar plan to diversify its energy mix and free up more crude oil for export.

The drive by the world's top oil exporter will see the kingdom developing 30 solar and wind projects by 2023 to boost its electricity generation and reduce crude oil burning.

Saudi Arabia is targeting 9.5 gigawatt (GW) of renewable energy by 2023. The renewables initiative involves investment estimated between $30 billion and $50 billion.

Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih kicked off the massive renewable programme in Riyadh on Monday by announcing the beginning of the bidding process for a 300 megawatt (MW) solar power project, which is expected to come online by 2018-2019.

"The energy mix to produce electricity will change, today the kingdom uses large quantities of oil liquids, including crude, fuel oil and diesel," Falih said.

"So the percentage of renewable energy by 2023 (will be) 10 percent of total installed capacity in the kingdom."

Under an economic reform programme launched last year, known as Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is seeking to use non-oil means to generate much of its additional future energy needs to avoid running down oil resources and diversify its economy.

ENERGY REFORM PUSH

The kingdom is restructuring its energy sector as part of Vision 2030 and a focus on renewable projects is a pillar of this transformation as it would help develop the private sector and create thousands of jobs.

"Since the restructuring of the energy sector ... one of our key priorities is to engage with the private sector," Falih said, adding he was confident the programme would be delivered.

Saudi Arabia has short-listed 27 companies for its solar power project and 24 firms for its wind project, the energy ministry said last week. [nL8N1HI3KK]

France's EDF Energies Nouvelles , Japanese companies Marubeni Corp <8002.T> and Mitsui & Co <8031.T> and Saudi Acwa Power are among the firms which have qualified to bid for the 300 MW solar PV project in Sakaka, the al-Jouf Province in the north of the kingdom.

Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar), GE , Marubeni Corporation, Mitsui & Co., JGC Corp <1963.T>, SNC Lavalin Arabia and Iberdrola Renovables Energia are among those qualified to bid for the 400 MW wind farm project in Midyan in the northwest.

The kingdom also plans to launch a second bidding round for 400 MW of wind power at a project in Domat al-Jandal in al-Jouf Province by the fourth quarter of this year, which will be followed by 620 MW of solar power, Turki Shehri, head of the renewable energy project development office at the energy ministry told reporters on Monday.

"This will come in stages. It (wind power project) will come in the fourth quarter of this year with Domat al-Jandal, and then the 620 MW (solar) will come immediately after that in phases," he said.

The projects will be tendered on a build, operate and own basis, meaning the companies which win the projects will retain ownership for 20 years for the solar plants and 25 years for the wind, Shehri said.

State oil giant Saudi Aramco would be interested in investing in the second bidding round for renewable projects as it aims to play a major role in the sector, Abdulaziz al-Judaimi, senior vice president for downstream at Aramco said.

Aramco, which is preparing to list up to 5 percent of its shares by next year, has created a department for renewables within the company to develop wind and solar projects.

The kingdom has a long-term goal of increasing the use of gas for domestic power generation, thus reducing oil burning at home and freeing up more crude for export.

This could help increase Aramco's valuation as it generates more revenue from exports than selling oil at lower domestic prices - Saudi Arabia is the world's fifth-biggest oil consumer despite being only the 20th biggest economy.

The OPEC heavyweight burned an average of 700,000 bpd of oil for electricity to keep the population cool in the hottest months from May to August.

The expansion into renewables will help the kingdom to save 18 million barrels of oil equivalent being consumed for electricity generation by 2020, Shehri said.

UPDATE 2-U.S. and Indonesia seek to cut trade and investment barriers - 路透新闻

{{20170421T053527.123+0000}}UPDATE 2-U.S. and Indonesia seek to cut trade and investment barriers* Indonesia on Trump's trade review list; US firms in firing line

* Pence cites barriers in IP, regulations, local content

* Pence witnesses signing of $10 bln in agreements with US firms

* VP says US working to combat terrorism with Indonesia

* Trump to visit Southeast Asia in November for summits

(Wraps up visit, Pence leaves for Australia, edits throughout)

By Roberta Rampton and Eveline Danubrata

JAKARTA, April 21 (Reuters) - Indonesia and the United States agreed on Friday to find ways to reduce barriers to U.S. companies operating in Southeast Asia's largest economy, visiting U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Jakarta's investment chief said.

The Trump administration has put Indonesia on a list of 16 countries whose trade surpluses with the United States will be put under review. A series of disputes between Indonesia and American firms has also ruffled ties.

"We will work with President Jokowi to reduce barriers to trade and investments and to create a truly level playing field where all our businesses have equal opportunity and market access," Pence said. Jokowi is the nickname of Indonesia's President Joko Widodo.

"The president and I spoke about that very candidly and very respectfully," Pence told a roundtable discussion with business executives in Jakarta before flying to Australia on the last leg of his 10-day Asia-Pacific tour.

Indonesia's investments barriers include a lack of intellectual property protection, insufficient transparency with regulations and requiring local content for manufactured goods sold in the Indonesian market, Pence said.

Indonesia's Investment Coordinating Board chief Tom Lembong said Widodo agreed "we still have too many regulations, too many barriers to trade, and these are bad for local and international industries".

"I'm optimistic because President Jokowi and President Trump are both lifelong business people, and I think they are very focused on the practical issues that hinder business and investment," Lembong told Reuters. "I feel that the Trump administration and the Jokowi administration are on the same wavelength."

Lembong said Indonesia needs both investment and imports from the United States, "especially productivity-enhancing products and services. You need imports to boost exports."

$10 BILLION AGREEMENTS

Neither side disclosed any discussions about the disputes Indonesia has had with American companies of late.

Over the past six months, Indonesia has wrestled with mining giant Freeport McMoRan , demanding the company divest 51 percent of its shares in its Papua-based gold and copper mine, and has demanded that Google Inc. settle unpaid taxes and fines of more than $400 million. Jakarta also scrubbed JP Morgan from its list of primary bond dealers after what was deemed a negative research report.

Pence did, however, witness the signing of more than $10 billion in memoranda of understanding with U.S. companies in Indonesia on Friday.

Among the 11 agreements were ones by Exxon Mobil to sell liquefied natural gas to Pertamina, Lockheed Martin to provide upgrades to the Indonesian Air Force's F-16s, and General Electric to develop electrical infrastructure in Indonesia.

"We think there are opportunities to clear open the way for American companies to participate more greatly in Indonesia," Pence said, adding the agreements would "draw our nations closer together and benefit both our people."

COUNTER-TERRORISM COOPERATION

Pence said in opening remarks to the roundtable that an attack in central Paris is the latest reminder terrorism can strike anywhere at anytime, and the United States would not relent in its efforts to end terrorism.

"The people of Indonesia can be confident in the wake of this latest attack: We will not relent in our effort to end terrorism and the threat it presents to both of our peoples," Pence said.

A French policeman was shot dead and two others were wounded in central Paris on Thursday night in an attack carried out days before presidential elections and quickly claimed by the Islamic State militant group.

Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority nation, has itself been hit by a series of deadly attacks over the past 15 years, led by militants affiliated with al Qaeda and more recently by Islamic State.

Pence said Washington would continue working with Indonesia to combat terrorism. On Thursday, Pence toured the Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta, Southeast Asia's largest, and said Indonesia's moderate form of Islam should serve as an example to other nations.

Indonesia has expressed concern about the Trump administration's proposal to bar entry to citizens of some predominantly Muslim nations. That plan, however, remains stalled in courts.

Pence on Thursday announced Trump would visit Southeast Asia in November for an annual series of regional summits. They include the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Vietnam and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit in the Philippines.

What to Watch in the Day Ahead - Friday, April 21 - 路透新闻

Industrial conglomerate General Electric Co is scheduled to post results for the first quarter. Investors are looking for the company to cut costs and lift profits to hit the targets it set out in March after discussions with activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management.

Schlumberger Ltd, the world's No.1 oilfield services provider, is expected to post a lower first-quarter profit, hurt by the cost of reactivating idled rigs and equipment. However, revenue is expected to rise as improved drilling activity in North America helped Schlumberger roll back discounts offered during the downturn in oil prices. Investors will be looking for comments on the recovery in international and offshore markets.

World finance leaders will gather for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Washington, where the case against protectionist trade policies is likely to be a major theme. The IMF in particular has sounded warnings against U.S. President Donald Trump's plans to shrink U.S. trade deficits with potential measures to restrict imports, arguing in its latest economic forecasts that protectionist policies would crimp global growth that is starting to gain traction.

Honeywell International Inc, a diversified manufacturer that makes aircraft parts, catalysts and absorbents used for petroleum refining, is expected to report lower revenue for the first quarter, hurt by weakness in its aerospace business. Sales in the business have been hurt in the past year due to a slowing business jet market. However, Honeywell has forecast its full year organic sales growth rate would improve for the first time in three years, partly helped by the stabilizing oil and gas market. Investors will look for an update on 2017 financial forecast.

Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari, the lone dissenter at last month's Fed policy meeting and one of the most dovish members of the US central bank, participates in a question-and-answer session as part of the Hamline University Community Economic Development Symposium. With the Fed's communications blackout beginning on Saturday, Kashkari's comments will be among the last from Fed policymakers ahead of their meeting in May. (0930/1330)

On the economic front, data is expected to show March existing home sales expanded slightly to 5.6 million, from 5.48 million in February. Markit's PMI flash data for April is expected to show a slightly higher reading.

Canada's annual inflation rate is likely to have slipped to 1.8 percent in March from 2 percent in February, data from Statistics Canada is expected to show. (0830/1230)

Interpublic Group of Companies Inc is expected to report its fourth consecutive rise in quarterly revenue, helped this time by U.S. companies allocating larger budgets for ad spending in the first quarter.

Aviation electronics maker Rockwell Collins Inc is expected to report strong revenue for the second quarter, helped by its $6.4 billion acquisition of aircraft interior maker B/E Aerospace Inc. Investors will watch for an update on full year financial forecast.

Mexico's national statistics agency will release unemployment data, which is expected to show the jobless rate dropped to 3.30 percent in March, from 3.40 percent the previous month. (0900/ 1300)

RPT-Saudi Arabia pushes ahead with renewable drive to diversify energy mix - 路透新闻

{{20170418T070002.765+0000}}RPT-Saudi Arabia pushes ahead with renewable drive to diversify energy mix(Repeats April 17 story with no changes)

By Rania El Gamal, Reem Shamseddine and Katie Paul

RIYADH, April 17 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia aims to produce 10 percent of its power from renewable sources in the next six years as it pushes ahead with a multi-billion-dollar plan to diversify its energy mix and free up more crude oil for export.

The drive by the world's top oil exporter will see the kingdom developing 30 solar and wind projects by 2023 to boost its electricity generation and reduce crude oil burning.

Saudi Arabia is targeting 9.5 gigawatt (GW) of renewable energy by 2023. The renewables initiative involves investment estimated between $30 billion and $50 billion.

Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih kicked off the massive renewable programme in Riyadh on Monday by announcing the beginning of the bidding process for a 300 megawatt (MW) solar power project, which is expected to come online by 2018-2019.

"The energy mix to produce electricity will change, today the kingdom uses large quantities of oil liquids, including crude, fuel oil and diesel," Falih said.

"So the percentage of renewable energy by 2023 (will be) 10 percent of total installed capacity in the kingdom."

Under an economic reform programme launched last year, known as Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is seeking to use non-oil means to generate much of its additional future energy needs to avoid running down oil resources and diversify its economy.

ENERGY REFORM PUSH

The kingdom is restructuring its energy sector as part of Vision 2030 and a focus on renewable projects is a pillar of this transformation as it would help develop the private sector and create thousands of jobs.

"Since the restructuring of the energy sector ... one of our key priorities is to engage with the private sector," Falih said, adding he was confident the programme would be delivered.

Saudi Arabia has short-listed 27 companies for its solar power project and 24 firms for its wind project, the energy ministry said last week. [nL8N1HI3KK]

France's EDF Energies Nouvelles , Japanese companies Marubeni Corp <8002.T> and Mitsui & Co <8031.T> and Saudi Acwa Power are among the firms which have qualified to bid for the 300 MW solar PV project in Sakaka, the al-Jouf Province in the north of the kingdom.

Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar), GE , Marubeni Corporation, Mitsui & Co., JGC Corp <1963.T>, SNC Lavalin Arabia and Iberdrola Renovables Energia are among those qualified to bid for the 400 MW wind farm project in Midyan in the northwest.

The kingdom also plans to launch a second bidding round for 400 MW of wind power at a project in Domat al-Jandal in al-Jouf Province by the fourth quarter of this year, which will be followed by 620 MW of solar power, Turki Shehri, head of the renewable energy project development office at the energy ministry told reporters on Monday.

"This will come in stages. It (wind power project) will come in the fourth quarter of this year with Domat al-Jandal, and then the 620 MW (solar) will come immediately after that in phases," he said.

The projects will be tendered on a build, operate and own basis, meaning the companies which win the projects will retain ownership for 20 years for the solar plants and 25 years for the wind, Shehri said.

State oil giant Saudi Aramco would be interested in investing in the second bidding round for renewable projects as it aims to play a major role in the sector, Abdulaziz al-Judaimi, senior vice president for downstream at Aramco said.

Aramco, which is preparing to list up to 5 percent of its shares by next year, has created a department for renewables within the company to develop wind and solar projects.

The kingdom has a long-term goal of increasing the use of gas for domestic power generation, thus reducing oil burning at home and freeing up more crude for export.

This could help increase Aramco's valuation as it generates more revenue from exports than selling oil at lower domestic prices - Saudi Arabia is the world's fifth-biggest oil consumer despite being only the 20th biggest economy.

The OPEC heavyweight burned an average of 700,000 bpd of oil for electricity to keep the population cool in the hottest months from May to August.

The expansion into renewables will help the kingdom to save 18 million barrels of oil equivalent being consumed for electricity generation by 2020, Shehri said.

UPDATE 3-Trump's message to bankers: Wall Street reform rules may be eliminated - 路透新闻

{{20170411T222356.180+0000}}UPDATE 3-Trump's message to bankers: Wall Street reform rules may be eliminated(Adds details about Jeb Hensarling's plans to reintroduce a new draft of legislation to overhaul Dodd-Frank)

By Jeff Mason and Sarah N. Lynch

WASHINGTON, April 11 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump told a group of chief executives on Tuesday that his administration was revamping the Wall Street reform law known as Dodd-Frank and might eliminate the rules and replace them with "something else."

At the beginning of his administration, Trump ordered reviews of the major banking rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, and last week he said officials were planning a "major haircut" for them.

"For the bankers in the room, they'll be very happy because we're really doing a major streamlining and, perhaps, elimination, and replacing it with something else," Trump said on Tuesday.

"That will be the minimum. But we're doing a major elimination of the horrendous Dodd-Frank regulations, keeping some obviously, but getting rid of many," he said.

The White House is not unilaterally able to upend Dodd-Frank's rules, almost all of which are implemented by independent regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve.

A sweeping change to the law would require congressional action, though in some cases regulators may also have wiggle room to make changes through a formal rule-making process.

In February, Trump issued an executive order requiring Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to consult with U.S. regulators and submit a report outlining a proposal for possible regulatory and legislative changes that would help fuel economic growth and promote American business interests.

That report, due to be released in June, will likely serve as a blueprint for possible changes down the road.

Congressional action on a Wall Street bill is not expected in the near term, as Congress focuses primarily on healthcare and tax reform.

On Tuesday, House of Representatives Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling announced that he was planning to introduce a new draft by month's end of sweeping legislation known as the "Financial CHOICE Act" that would give Dodd-Frank a major overhaul.

The new draft of the bill would largely defang the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's supervisory powers and make the director removable at will.

It would also revamp bank stress-testing rules and loosen securities regulations to help companies raise cash.

The bill is likely to face an uphill battle in the Senate, where Democrats are expected to be resistant and a 60-vote threshold is needed to pass legislation.

Participants in Tuesday's meeting included Rich Lesser, chief executive of Boston Consulting Group; Doug McMillon, chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores Inc ; Indra Nooyi, chief executive of PepsiCo ; Jim McNerney, former chief executive of Boeing Co ; Ginni Rometty, chief executive of IBM ; and Jack Welch, former chairman of General Electric Co .

The business leaders are part of Trump's "Strategy and Policy Forum" that last met with him in February.

Trump also reiterated his criticism of the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico.

"NAFTA is a disaster. It's been a disaster from the day it was devised. And we're going to have some very pleasant surprises for you on NAFTA, that I can tell you," he said.

INTERVIEW-U.S. EXIM chief says White House split clouds trade bank's future  - 路透新闻

{{20170407T201910.188+0000}}INTERVIEW-U.S. EXIM chief says White House split clouds trade bank's future By David Lawder

WASHINGTON, April 7 (Reuters) - An internal White House conflict over the future of the U.S. Export-Import Bank is keeping the government trade lender hobbled in the face of China's massive state export finance offensive, EXIM's acting chairman said.

Charles "CJ" Hall told Reuters in an interview late on Thursday that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross supports restoring the bank's full lending powers as part of President Donald Trump's push to boost U.S. exports and manufacturing jobs.

He said there also were statements from several lawmakers that Trump himself supports EXIM's mission, [nL2N1HE1LC] but the same conservative Republican "ideologues" who tried to close the bank in 2015 are standing in the way of nominating new board members.

"There is a debate in the administration between differing views on EXIM Bank. I would characterize that debate in its simplest form as between pragmatists and ideologues," Hall said.

Conservative Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have fought for years to revoke EXIM's charter, charging that it provides unnecessary "corporate welfare" to giant corporations such as Boeing Co , General Electric Co and Caterpillar Inc .

Its charter was allowed to expire in 2015, but was restored five months later after a bitter fight in Congress. But with only two of five board seats filled and Obama nominees blocked last year, its loans and guarantees are capped at $10 million, preventing it from financing large exports such as commercial aircraft and power turbines.

Hall, an Obama administration appointee who was asked to stay on for six months as Trump took office in January, was unusually candid about the split for an executive agency chief.

"Secretary Ross is one of the pragmatists" who supports restoring EXIM's full powers, Hall said.

"In terms of identifying the others, I would say it's more the Heritage Foundation point of view. And we know there are a lot of people from the Heritage Foundation who are salted around the Executive Office of the President, both in the White House and the Office of Management and Budget."

Dan Holler, a spokesman for the foundation's political arm, Heritage Action for America, said that EXIM too often helps foreign competitors, citing Mexico's state oil company Pemex, which benefited from $7 billion in EXIM financing for U.S. exports between 2007 and 2013.

"Unless Secretary Ross can demonstrate the bank actually creates jobs in America, there is really no argument for moving forward," Holler said.

Hall said the bank fits into Trump's trade "sweet-spot" to boost U.S. exports and compete more effectively with China.

In 2015, China's three export credit agencies provided $576 billion in total financing and guarantees, while a curtailed EXIM did only $10.6 billion. Hall noted that in 2014 and 2015, the Chinese agencies provided more financing than EXIM has in its entire 83-year history.

UPDATE 2-Boeing forms venture group, invests in two tech startups - 路透新闻

{{20170405T212107.684+0000}}UPDATE 2-Boeing forms venture group, invests in two tech startups(Adds detail, comment from Boeing HorizonX executive)

By Alwyn Scott

SEATTLE, April 5 (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Wednesday it had launched a venture capital arm and invested in two tech startups, a fresh sign of the importance big companies see in keeping up with rapidly evolving technology for designing and making products.

Boeing's new division, known as HorizonX, invested in Upskill, a Washington, D.C.-based software company that uses Google Glass-type eye wear to help assembly workers with complex tasks such as creating wiring bundles for Boeing jetliners.

It also invested in Zunum Aero, a Seattle-area company that is working on electric-hybrid aircraft aimed at bringing down the cost of flying to regional airports. Zunum also received funding from JetBlue Technology Ventures, a unit of the New York-based JetBlue Airways Corp .

Boeing and JetBlue are not alone in taking stakes in promising technology companies. General Electric Co's venture arm invested in an earlier Upskill funding round, and Airbus has had a venture fund since 2014.

Boeing is not aiming to profit from the ventures directly but instead to access technology used in autonomous vehicles, machine learning, additive manufacturing and wearable devices, said Steve Nordlund, a Boeing vice president who heads HorizonX.

"These are all starting to converge and have the potential to fundamentally change how we operate inside and outside of companies," he said.

Upskill's software platform for example, brings data typically stored in books into workers' tools. The system can be used in manufacturing, field service and shipping and warehouse logistics, and the company's revenue growth is in triple digits annually, Chief Executive Officer Brian Ballard told Reuters.

"Imagine working on a car and not having to flip through the paper manual," Ballard said. Typical systems pay back in a few months. Upskill has been working with Boeing for two years and has moved beyond pilot tests into production.

Boeing declined to specify investment amounts, "but this initiative represents a multi-year commitment by Boeing to spend tens of millions of dollars a year to advance innovation and to supplement our research and development efforts," spokesman Chaz Bickers said.

Nordlund was formerly vice president of strategy for Boeing's defense, space and security business and was involved in launching drone-maker Insitu Inc, which Boeing acquired in 2008. He also has worked in sales at IBM and was chief information officer at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.

INTERVIEW-U.S. EXIM chief says White House split clouds trade bank's future  - 路透新闻

{{20170407T201910.188+0000}}INTERVIEW-U.S. EXIM chief says White House split clouds trade bank's future By David Lawder

WASHINGTON, April 7 (Reuters) - An internal White House conflict over the future of the U.S. Export-Import Bank is keeping the government trade lender hobbled in the face of China's massive state export finance offensive, EXIM's acting chairman said.

Charles "CJ" Hall told Reuters in an interview late on Thursday that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross supports restoring the bank's full lending powers as part of President Donald Trump's push to boost U.S. exports and manufacturing jobs.

He said there also were statements from several lawmakers that Trump himself supports EXIM's mission, [nL2N1HE1LC] but the same conservative Republican "ideologues" who tried to close the bank in 2015 are standing in the way of nominating new board members.

"There is a debate in the administration between differing views on EXIM Bank. I would characterize that debate in its simplest form as between pragmatists and ideologues," Hall said.

Conservative Republicans, including House Speaker Paul Ryan, have fought for years to revoke EXIM's charter, charging that it provides unnecessary "corporate welfare" to giant corporations such as Boeing Co , General Electric Co and Caterpillar Inc .

Its charter was allowed to expire in 2015, but was restored five months later after a bitter fight in Congress. But with only two of five board seats filled and Obama nominees blocked last year, its loans and guarantees are capped at $10 million, preventing it from financing large exports such as commercial aircraft and power turbines.

Hall, an Obama administration appointee who was asked to stay on for six months as Trump took office in January, was unusually candid about the split for an executive agency chief.

"Secretary Ross is one of the pragmatists" who supports restoring EXIM's full powers, Hall said.

"In terms of identifying the others, I would say it's more the Heritage Foundation point of view. And we know there are a lot of people from the Heritage Foundation who are salted around the Executive Office of the President, both in the White House and the Office of Management and Budget."

Dan Holler, a spokesman for the foundation's political arm, Heritage Action for America, said that EXIM too often helps foreign competitors, citing Mexico's state oil company Pemex, which benefited from $7 billion in EXIM financing for U.S. exports between 2007 and 2013.

"Unless Secretary Ross can demonstrate the bank actually creates jobs in America, there is really no argument for moving forward," Holler said.

Hall said the bank fits into Trump's trade "sweet-spot" to boost U.S. exports and compete more effectively with China.

In 2015, China's three export credit agencies provided $576 billion in total financing and guarantees, while a curtailed EXIM did only $10.6 billion. Hall noted that in 2014 and 2015, the Chinese agencies provided more financing than EXIM has in its entire 83-year history.

UPDATE 2-Boeing forms venture group, invests in two tech startups - 路透新闻

{{20170405T212107.684+0000}}UPDATE 2-Boeing forms venture group, invests in two tech startups(Adds detail, comment from Boeing HorizonX executive)

By Alwyn Scott

SEATTLE, April 5 (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Wednesday it had launched a venture capital arm and invested in two tech startups, a fresh sign of the importance big companies see in keeping up with rapidly evolving technology for designing and making products.

Boeing's new division, known as HorizonX, invested in Upskill, a Washington, D.C.-based software company that uses Google Glass-type eye wear to help assembly workers with complex tasks such as creating wiring bundles for Boeing jetliners.

It also invested in Zunum Aero, a Seattle-area company that is working on electric-hybrid aircraft aimed at bringing down the cost of flying to regional airports. Zunum also received funding from JetBlue Technology Ventures, a unit of the New York-based JetBlue Airways Corp .

Boeing and JetBlue are not alone in taking stakes in promising technology companies. General Electric Co's venture arm invested in an earlier Upskill funding round, and Airbus has had a venture fund since 2014.

Boeing is not aiming to profit from the ventures directly but instead to access technology used in autonomous vehicles, machine learning, additive manufacturing and wearable devices, said Steve Nordlund, a Boeing vice president who heads HorizonX.

"These are all starting to converge and have the potential to fundamentally change how we operate inside and outside of companies," he said.

Upskill's software platform for example, brings data typically stored in books into workers' tools. The system can be used in manufacturing, field service and shipping and warehouse logistics, and the company's revenue growth is in triple digits annually, Chief Executive Officer Brian Ballard told Reuters.

"Imagine working on a car and not having to flip through the paper manual," Ballard said. Typical systems pay back in a few months. Upskill has been working with Boeing for two years and has moved beyond pilot tests into production.

Boeing declined to specify investment amounts, "but this initiative represents a multi-year commitment by Boeing to spend tens of millions of dollars a year to advance innovation and to supplement our research and development efforts," spokesman Chaz Bickers said.

Nordlund was formerly vice president of strategy for Boeing's defense, space and security business and was involved in launching drone-maker Insitu Inc, which Boeing acquired in 2008. He also has worked in sales at IBM and was chief information officer at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Empire-building sets HNA on a risky trajectory - 路透新闻

{{20170403T032200.217+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Empire-building sets HNA on a risky trajectory(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Quentin Webb

HONG KONG, April 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - HNA Group's empire-building puts it on a risky trajectory. The Chinese travel outfit has spent tens of billions of dollars abroad on everything from land and hotels to high finance. These are just opening gambits as HNA seeks to amass trillions of dollars in assets.

In just a couple of years, bold M&A has launched HNA onto the world stage. Investments in aircraft leasing, cargo handling, airline catering, Hilton hotels, and computer wholesaling come to $30 billion. In recent weeks it has built a $1.1 billion stake in Deutsche Bank , put down $2.2 billion for marquee New York offices, and bought into Old Mutual's U.S. fund-management arm . Reuters says it is now in talks about buying the publisher of Forbes, the U.S. business magazine famous for tallying the world's wealthy, and German shipping financier HSH Nordbank.

The overseas forays follow an incredible run at home. HNA started by operating a regional carrier on the beach resort island of Hainan with just one Boeing 737 to its name, according to a 2014 profile. Co-founder Chen Feng, who shares the title of chairman with company veteran Wang Jian, espouses a management ethos blending Buddhism and ancient Chinese philosophy. Under Chen and his colleagues, HNA now runs more than a dozen airlines, a similar number of airports, thousands of shops and hotels, and much else besides.

Graphic: HNA does M&A: http://reut.rs/2orfhOA

Today it boasts a trillion yuan ($145 billion) in assets and over 400,000 staff. The HNA Group is itself private, partly owned by a charitable foundation. But there are at least a dozen listed units, mostly in China and Hong Kong, including the $8 billion Hainan Airlines <600221.SS>. In short, HNA exemplifies the ambition of today's China Inc. So far that has paid off fabulously – at least for bankers and those with assets to sell.

STILL IN FASHION

HNA's appetite is more impressive than its financials. The unlisted parent is indebted and not terribly profitable: at end-2015, total debt was 10.7 times EBITDA, or roughly 273 billion yuan. Debt made up 70.4 percent of total capital, although that ratio has fallen 4.1 percentage points over the previous four years. HNA made a slim 3.6 percent return on equity, Breakingviews calculates. However, these accounts offer just a snapshot into a complex, fast-growing business - and one that probably prioritises future growth over current returns.

There is some logic in expanding across transport, tourism and aviation. Diversifying out of airlines, a famously value-destructive industry, makes sense. So does reducing overall exposure to China's economy and currency; given question marks about both, it is rational for Chinese firms to borrow cheaply and buy foreign assets.

But HNA's thesis that business lines that move people, things, and money around should naturally fit together doesn't seem convincing. Understanding Chinese travellers does not help when it comes to valuing a Western investment bank or a hedge-fund platform, nor are there obvious concrete benefits from shared ownership.

In the end, this looks like old-school empire-building. While Western outfits like General Electric have tightened up considerably, giant conglomerates never went out of fashion in China. Bosses often want companies to be as big as possible, rather than maximising profit and efficiency.

That would help explain why HNA is spending so freely. For example, it paid Blackstone 15 percent more than the market price for a stake in Hilton and won a series of property auctions in Hong Kong, a famously expensive market. A 2015 Harvard Business School case study says HNA is targeting $5 to $6 trillion of assets by 2025 - more than double the $2.5 trillion of assets held today by JPMorgan , America's biggest bank, and at least eight times the $621 billion of assets at Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway . It is hard to see HNA going so far, so fast, while staying disciplined.

COMMUNIST CREDENTIALS

Does HNA have other, hidden motives for its buying spree? Probably not. Like any big Chinese outfit, HNA is not entirely separate from party or state. Chen attends high-powered Communist Party gatherings. State banks are big supporters. And HNA matters hugely to its local government in Hainan.

But that does not mean HNA is doing Beijing's bidding. Unlike other areas where China is expanding, from movies to nuclear power, little of what HNA does looks strategically significant. Even the attempt to buy SkyBridge, the hedge-fund firm run by Donald Trump supporter Anthony Scaramucci, seems more naive than malign in retrospect, given the inevitable resulting controversy.

The better question is whether HNA is heading for trouble, and what would happen if it blew up. There is no suggestion that HNA today is in anything other than fine financial health. A hands-off approach to acquisitions should in theory mean it gets the benefit of skilled local management.

But history is littered with M&A machines that over-paid and over-reached: from ITT, the 1960s uber-conglomerate, to dotcom-darling WorldCom and drug industry consolidator Valeant. The wider an empire's territory, the harder it is to govern. The more debt deployed, the greater the financial risk.

Beijing hates a mess. It seems doubtful the government would allow a collapse of a big Chinese company, at least if it could avoid it. Officials would do their best to avoid contagion, job losses and national embarrassment.

But there are limits. Were things ever to go wrong, it would be naive to assume foreign lenders would be made whole, even if the operating business carried on. The 1999 collapse of Guangdong International Trust & Investment Corp made clear Beijing would let overseas investors take losses, contrary to expectations. The GITIC default involved less than $5 billion in debt. Were a globe-spanning business twice as big as JPMorgan to run into difficulties, the fallout could make GITIC's woes look triflingly small.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Companies backed by China's HNA Group have spent tens of billions of dollars on overseas mergers and acquisitions in the last two years. The biggest deal was the $10.1 billion purchase of an aircraft-leasing business from CIT. Other major deals include the $6.5 billion purchase of 25 percent of Hilton Worldwide; the $6.3 billion takeover of U.S. computer wholesaler Ingram Micro; and the $2.8 billion acquisition of cargo-handling firm Swissport International.

- In real estate, a unit of HNA agreed to buy 245 Park Avenue in Manhattan for $2.2 billion, Reuters reported on March 21, citing a source familiar with the transaction. It has also spent HK$27.2 billion ($3.5 billion) since November buying four plots of land in Hong Kong's Kai Tak area, where it plans to build a "world-class integrated residential complex".

- In finance, HNA has amassed a 4.76 percent stake in Deutsche Bank in two stages since February. The stake was worth about $1.1 billion as of March 31's close, Eikon data shows. On March 26, it agreed to buy 24.95 percent of Old Mutual's U.S. subsidiary, Old Mutual Asset Management, in a two-part deal worth $446 million.

- HNA is in talks to buy a controlling stake in the owner of the publisher of Forbes magazine, in a deal worth at least $400 million, Reuters reported on March 28, citing two sources with knowledge of the matter. Hong Kong-based Integrated Whale Media Investments, which holds 95 percent of Forbes Media, is also in talks with another Chinese entity, and is scouting for more potential buyers, Reuters added.
