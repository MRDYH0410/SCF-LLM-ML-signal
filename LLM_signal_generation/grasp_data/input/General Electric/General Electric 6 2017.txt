S.Korea's SK Group signs MOU with GE to jointly develop U.S. shale gas - 路透新闻

{{20170629T021231.483+0000}}S.Korea's SK Group signs MOU with GE to jointly develop U.S. shale gas* Seeks to expand business in U.S. shale gas sector

* Plans to invest about $1.6 bln in U.S. over the next five years

* KOGAS signs MOU with Exxon Mobil, Energy Transfer for LNG projects

SEOUL, June 29 (Reuters) - South Korean energy conglomerate SK Group signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with General Electric on Thursday to jointly develop U.S. shale gas fields in a bid to expand in the U.S. shale gas sector.

The partnership with GE will help SK Group bring in U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) to South Korea as well as onsell it to other countries amid growing U.S. LNG exports, SK Group said in a statement.

The deal was signed a day ahead of a planned summit meeting between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington.

SK Group said it planned to invest 1.8 trillion won ($1.6 billion) in the United States over the next five years and would seek up to 5 trillion won worth of potential investment opportunities.

The investment would also help the United States export about 2 trillion won of U.S.-origin LNG per year and narrow a trade gap between the two countries, the company said in the statement.

Also on Thursday, Korea Gas Corp <036460.KS>, the world's second-biggest LNG buyer, said it signed an MOU with U.S. companies including Exxon Mobil and Energy Transfer for cooperation in U.S. LNG projects.

KOGAS is set to receive its first LNG cargo under a 20-year deal with U.S. exporter Cheniere Energy in early July. [nL3N1JK2TP]

In January this year, SK E&S, SK Group's power and gas arm, imported South Korea's first spot cargo of U.S. shale gas from Cheniere Energy Inc. SK E&S is also set to bring in 2.2 million tonnes a year of U.S. LNG from 2019 through 2039.[nL4N1FA2TG]

JPMorgan Chase to centralize energy controls for 4,500 branches - Reuters News

{{20170628T040002.785+0000}}JPMorgan Chase to centralize energy controls for 4,500 branchesNEW YORK, June 28 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co is shifting control of heating, air-conditioning and lighting in 4,500 of its branches to an operations center hosted in the internet cloud.

Sol Gindi, chief administrative officer for JPMorgan's consumer bank, said the company is making the change so that bank branch managers and loan officers can do their jobs instead of adjusting thermostats and keeping track of replacing light bulbs before they burn out.

The move is expected to reduce energy consumption in the branches by 15 percent, Gindi told Reuters on Tuesday.

"To operate in the most efficient way, we have to be centralized and automated," he said.

The energy and lighting management will be done by General Electric Co using sensors in branches across the United States and linked by the internet to computers. The work also includes managing water for irrigation of landscapes, as well as a pilot installation of solar panels at California branches.

GE last year got the job of replacing old light bulbs in Chase branches with more energy efficient LED bulbs.

Chase has another 700 branches that are not included in the plan for various reasons, including locations in buildings that are leased or not suited to the new controls.

The actions could save roughly $20 million a year - tiny compared with JPMorgan's $58 billion of company-wide expenses. More valuable, Gindi said, is supporting branch employees in their jobs and keeping customers comfortable.

"If we do the right thing there, our revenue is going to grow," he said.

AIRSHOW-New Boeing bosses target more wins after Paris plane launch - 路透新闻

{{20170626T150310.358+0000}}AIRSHOW-New Boeing bosses target more wins after Paris plane launch* Boeing beat Airbus at air show after launching new jet

* Assertive style contrasts with flatter Airbus tone

* New 737 version seen partly designed to defend 737 MAX 8

* "We are playing offence," new Boeing sales chief says

By Tim Hepher

PARIS, June 26 (Reuters) - Boeing's new commercial management has signalled a determination to win back market share with a combative new style, swapping traits with an unusually sombre Airbus after winning the Paris Airshow with a slick launch for its new 737 MAX 10 jet.

A carefully packaged week of announcements created momentum that Boeing has struggled to display in recent years after being outmanoeuvred for sales of single-aisle planes since the pair decided to upgrade their best-selling models early this decade.

Boeing has seen its market share fall from 50 percent to around 42 percent for the latest models, partly because the Airbus A320 family's design allowed it to use a larger version of the latest generation of engines, which helps in some cases.

It was the first show in their respective roles for ex-General Electric executive Kevin McAllister, the first outsider hired to run Boeing's commercial division, and Ihssane Mounir, recently made sales chief after fighting Airbus in North Asia.

Its outcome reflects a "more aggressive marketing strategy" at the U.S. company, Jefferies analyst Howard Rubel wrote in a note.

Boeing got 361 orders and commitments for the 737 MAX 10 from 16 customers, including 147 incremental ones. Reuters had reported it would win close to 150 incremental orders.

"It's a fightback. It goes back to (McAllister's predecessor) Ray Conner's recent talk about winning markets," said Nick Cunningham, analyst at UK-based Agency Partners.

"The battle showed itself in price and is now beginning to show itself in products."

Boeing's energy contrasted with a flatter tone than usual from Airbus, even though it too won more orders than expected.

It suggests Boeing will be looking to maintain last week's momentum as it tries to poach Airbus customers without the previous disadvantage of an uneven portfolio dependent mainly on the smaller MAX 8, industry sources said.

That could result in bruising battles as Boeing's fired-up new management targets Airbus customers while working on a separate new mid-sized aircraft project for next decade.

Airbus denied it had lost any momentum.

Its executives painted the 737 MAX 10 as something forced on Boeing to defend a weak market share, and highlighted the more than 200 conversions to 737 MAX 10s from existing Boeing orders. Some questioned whether all buyers would stick with the model.

"It was a good PR exercise. I am not so sure if there was as much quality or substance to they deals they did at the air show," said Kiran Rao, recently designated as successor to Airbus sales chief John Leahy, who retires this year.

Analyst Scott Hamilton of Leeham News played down Airbus's objection about conversions, saying switching up in size is standard and noting the important backing of United Airlines for the new Boeing model.

Still, industry sources said Boeing's decision to launch the 737 MAX 10, seating up to 230 people, was a twin defensive move.

Most attention focused on Boeing's need to fix a gap in seats at the top end of its single-aisle portfolio against the A321neo, which Airbus says can seat up to 240 people.

PROTECTING 737 MAX 8

But Boeing had a second reason to launch the 737 MAX 10.

Industry sources say it had grown increasingly worried about losing sales of its main cash cow, the MAX 8, through the back door because of interlocking relationships between models.

Alarm bells began ringing at the same air show two years ago when Korean Air <003490.KS> split a $6.9 billion order for narrow-body jets between the A321neo and Boeing 737 MAX 8.

The success of the A321neo created the threat that Boeing customers who needed a high proportion of the larger category in their fleets could pick the A321neo, and then take the 150-seat A320neo by default to avoid the inefficiency of two types.

Airbus says the A321neo size will make up half the single- aisle market, worth $3 trillion over 20 years.

Boeing says it will be closer to 25 percent.

But even at Boeing's lower estimate, the success of the A321neo handed Airbus a powerful lever to make inroads into the rest of Boeing's fleet and damage its biggest-selling product.

"It was a threat. Boeing needed to defend the 737 MAX 8," a senior aircraft leasing company executive said.

The grab for market share, which began under soon-to-retire Boeing vice chairman Ray Conner, who handed the commercial unit to McAllister in November, still leaves Boeing trailing Airbus.

"It improves the 737's competitive position but does not resolve it entirely," Cunningham said.

Mounir rejected a suggestion that Boeing had approached the air show in the spirit of 'attack is the best form of defence'.

"We are playing offence; this was offence," he told Reuters.

UPDATE 9-Police consider manslaughter charges over London blaze as thousands evacuated - 路透新闻

{{20170624T010954.122+0000}}UPDATE 9-Police consider manslaughter charges over London blaze as thousands evacuated* Tower cladding failed safety tests - police

* London council moves thousands on new fire fears

* Blaze started in Hotpoint fridge freezer

* Whirlpool shares suffer $500 mln hit

* Police fear death toll could rise above 79

(Updates number of people affected, adds political reaction)

By Michael Holden and Jamillah Knowles

LONDON, June 24 (Reuters) - British investigators said on Friday they would consider manslaughter charges over the London tower block fire that killed at least 79 people, as thousands of apartment-dwellers a few miles away were told to leave their homes due to fire risk.

The outside cladding engulfed in June 14's deadly blaze has since been shown to fail all safety tests, police said. They have already seized material from a number of undisclosed organisations.

Fire safety checks are now taking place on public buildings across Britain. Late on Friday, one municipal authority in north London began to evacuate nearly 4,000 people from five tower blocks after firefighters said it was unsafe for them to stay.

Detective Superintendent Fiona McCormack said experts had now concluded that the earlier fire, the mostly deadly blaze in London since World War Two, had started in a fridge freezer.

The blaze has provoked anger and heaped pressure on Prime Minister Theresa May, who is fighting for her political survival after her party lost its parliamentary majority in a snap election at a time when Britain is beginning divorce talks with the European Union. [nL8N1JK1RQ]

The speed at which the fire engulfed the 24-storey Grenfell Tower raised questions about the external cladding on the block.

Asked if the insulation and aluminium tiles used were acceptable for such buildings, McCormack told reporters: "No they're not."

"All I can say at the moment is they don't pass any of the safety tests. So that will form part of what is a manslaughter investigation."

As well as possible manslaughter, police will consider health and safety offences and breaches of other building regulations. McCormack said all companies involved in the building and refurbishment of the building would be reviewed.

Britain also ordered an immediate technical examination of the Hotpoint fridge model FF175BP, which had not been subject to any recall to establish whether further action should be taken, but said there was no need for owners to switch off their appliances.

Whirlpool's shared closed down 3.3 percent on Friday, wiping almost $500 million off the company's value.

Whirlpool owns the Hotpoint brand in the Europe and Asia Pacific regions. In the United States, the Hotpoint brand now belongs to Haier, following the Chinese group's purchase of General Electric Co's appliance business.

"We are working with the authorities to obtain access to the appliance so that we can assist with the ongoing investigations," said Whirlpool, the world's largest maker of home appliances.

"Words cannot express our sorrow at this terrible tragedy," Whirlpool said in a statement.

The company said 64,000 such fridge freezers were made by Indesit between 2006 and 2009 when the model was discontinued, some years before Whirlpool acquired Indesit.

FOCUS OF ANGER

The fire has acted as a focal point for anger at local authority funding cuts and, if more buildings are deemed unsafe, the government faces the task of rehousing people within existing social housing facilities which are stretched.

The government said it was urgently conducting tests on some 600 high-rise buildings in England which have exterior cladding, often added to insulate them or improve the external appearance of ageing blocks. Some councils have begun removing the panels.

May, who faced criticism for slow public reaction to the fire, said on Twitter that her thoughts were with the 800 households being evacuated from a group of tower blocks in north London on Friday evening.

Residents complained of first hearing about the evacuation from the media and getting very short notice to leave from city officials going door to door.

"It was farcical communication. You don't get everyone to leave this quickly," 21-year-old Daniel Tackaberry told Reuters outside a nearby sports centre where the local council had laid out air beds for people for whom they could not find hotels.

Broadcaster Sky News showed one resident, Abdul, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, who said he had been told there was no hotel for him and he had to stay on an air bed.

The council's leader, Georgia Gould, said in a statement outside the council's offices that it would take up to four weeks to repair the blocks that were evacuated and later added in a radio interview that nearly 4,000 residents were affected.

Ed Miliband, the former leader of the opposition Labour Party, said on Twitter that May should have convened a central government emergency committee to assist the local council.

Grenfell Tower, in west London, had undergone an 8.7 million pound ($11 million) refurbishment that was completed in 2016, but residents of the more than 120 apartments had complained about its fire safety.

McCormack said the police investigation would look at the entire facade of the building, how the building was constructed and the refurbishment work. She said it would examine all aspects of the cladding: the aluminium tiles, the insulation behind it, how it was fitted to building and the installation.

In addition to the criminal investigation, police and firefighters were continuing painstaking efforts to locate the victims. So far only nine people have been formally identified and police said the remains of some might never be found, the blaze having been so fierce.

Some residents believe the official number of the dead or missing presumed dead was lower than the true figure. McCormack acknowledged they might not know everyone who was in the building as some people might fear coming forward because they were in the country illegally.

She said the government had given assurances they were not interested in anyone's immigration status.

"I remain really concerned though that we do not have a complete picture," she said. "I fear that there are more."

CORRECTED-GE wins first major east European deal from Alstom portfolio - 路透新闻

{{20170623T141810.762+0000}}CORRECTED-GE wins first major east European deal from Alstom portfolio(Corrects headline, paragraph 1 to clarify it is first major deal in the region, not globally)

FRANKFURT, June 23 (Reuters) - General Electric has won a large contract to supply gas power equipment for a new 430 megawatt Romanian power plant, the first major deal in the region to result from its $10.6 billion 2015 acquisition of Alstom's power business.

GE will supply all the core technology for the 268 million- euro ($299 million) combined-cycle plant being built in Iernut by Duro Felguera and Romelectro for state gas producer Romgaz .

Before the Alstom acquisition, GE would have simply supplied the gas turbines and walked away. With Alstom, it acquired steam technology as well as the ability to supply all the peripheral equipment needed to build a complete power plant.

GE told Reuters on Friday the plant would generate enough power to supply 1 million Romanian households, making it southeast Europe's biggest gas project in five years.

GE will supply four 6F gas turbines, two steam turbines and four heat-recovery steam generators for the plant, where building will start later this year and which is scheduled to be completed in 2019, replacing an existing plant at the same site.

U.S.-based GE has been present in Romania since 1984. ($1 = 0.8950 euros)

RPT-Big Oil turns to big data to save big money on drilling - 路透新闻

{{20170623T110001.634+0000}}RPT-Big Oil turns to big data to save big money on drilling(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text)

By Swetha Gopinath and Liz Hampton

June 23 (Reuters) - In today's U.S. shale fields, tiny sensors attached to production gear harvest data on everything from pumping pressure to the heat and rotational speed of drill bits boring into the rocky earth.

The sensors are leading Big Oil's mining of so-called big data, with some firms envisioning billions of dollars in savings over time by avoiding outages, managing supplies and identifying safety hazards.

The industry has long used sophisticated technologies to find oil and gas. But only recently have oil firms pooled data from across the company for wider operating efficiencies - one of many cost-cutting efforts spurred by the two-year downturn in crude oil prices.

ConocoPhillips says that sensors scattered across its well fields helped it halve the time it once took to drill new wells in Eagle Ford shale basin of South Texas.

By comparing data from hundreds of sensors, its program automatically adjusts the weight placed on a drill bit and its speed, accelerating the extraction of oil, said Matt Fox, ConocoPhillips' executive vice president for strategy, exploration and technology.

It is just one application, but if applied to the more than 3,000 wells ConocoPhillips hopes to drill in the Texas basin, those small sensors could lead to "billions and billions of dollars" in savings, Fox said in an interview.

"We started using data analytics in our Eagle Ford business," he said. "And everywhere we look there are applications for this."

The cost and complexity of such systems vary widely. Oil giants such as ConocoPhillips buy a mix of off-the-shelf and custom programs, along with data repositories. The Houston-based producer's employees use Tibco Software Inc's Spotfire data visualization package to analyze information from well sites.

Tibco declined to discuss its pricing.

Services firms including Schlumberger NV and General Electric Co oil and gas unit sell sensor-equipped gear, data repositories and software to improve producers' decision-making.

Back when oil traded at more than $100 a barrel - before the price crash in 2014 - data analysis was an "afterthought" for most oil firms, said Binu Mathew, who oversees digital products at GE Oil & Gas.

Now - with prices at about $43 a barrel after recovering from a low of about $26 in early 2016 - "the efficiency aspect is far, far more important," Mathew said.

FINDING HIDDEN VALUE

A survey by Ernst & Young last year examined 75 large oil and gas companies and found that 68 percent of them had invested more than $100 million each in data analytics during the past two years. Nearly three quarters of those firms planned to allocate between 6 and 10 percent of their capital budgets to digital technology, the survey found.

Effectively mining large data sets could lead to supplanting workers with artificial intelligence and machine learning systems, according to firms selling and buying data-driven technology.

Simple sensors already increase safety and savings by eliminating the need to send workers to rigs or production facilities to gather data. Automating drilling decisions can produce more consistent results by cutting out human errors, said Duane Cuku, vice president of sales for rig technology at Precision Drilling Corp .

"The driller is now able to focus his attention on the well - and the performance and safety of his crews - as opposed to the manual manipulation of controls," Cuku said.

Occidental Petroleum Corp also uses an analytical tool to find the best design for hydraulic fracturing wells. A new version of the software analyzes data on well completions and geology to recommend whether injecting steam or water would produce more oil.

Abhishek Gaurav, a petroleum engineer for closely-held Texas Standard Oil, said he uses big-data analytics to help his company choose which properties to explore.

Using Spotfire, the same program utilized by Conoco, Standard applies a combination of data science and petroleum engineering to rank asking prices for land based on a variety of completion, production and geological variables - such as the amount of sand that likely would be required to complete a well in a given formation.

The technique, Gaurav said, has reduced the time needed for evaluating land parcels from weeks to hours - and resulted in better decisions.

"We found value in properties when many other teams did not," he said.

RECRUITING IN CALIFORNIA

Some of the information craved by oil firms isn't so easy to gather or analyze.

Surveys and maps that companies use to acquire acreage for drilling, for instance, are often not digitized. Older company data on wells may be unstructured or spread among suppliers using different storage formats, making integration and analysis a challenge.

General Electric and its oil-and-gas unit are moving aggressively into the business of digitizing industrial equipment for other firms, and have invested in large data processing centers for energy clients.

GE sees huge potential for market growth: A company study estimated that only 3 percent to 5 percent of oil and gas equipment is connected digitally, and less than one percent of the data collected gets used for decision-making, the study found.

Getting the industry more fully connected will take time.

"There is a huge amount of data prep, data sanitization and data extraction needed for big data to be totally disruptive," said Kate Richard, chief executive at private equity investor Warwick Energy.

She projects a major payoff from the technology is still five or ten years away.

Oklahoma City-based Warwick - which manages interests in thousands of wells across Oklahoma and Texas - is preparing for that payoff by hiring people from tech hubs in California, Richard said.

"They all have computer programming and data science backgrounds," she said.

Trump meets wireless, drone executives on new technologies - 路透新闻

{{20170622T180653.107+0000}}Trump meets wireless, drone executives on new technologiesBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, June 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump offered support for emerging technologies including unmanned aerial vehicles and next-generation wireless networks in a meeting on Thursday with the chiefs of AT&T Inc and General Electric Co and other business leaders.

The White House brought together venture capitalists and executives from the telecommunications and drone, or unmanned aerial system, industries to discuss how the government can speed technologies to market.

The meeting, which lasted more than three hours including breakout sessions, is part of Trump's effort to tap industry experts on how to boost U.S. competitiveness in various fields and create jobs.

On Monday, Trump met with the heads of 18 U.S. technology companies including Apple Inc , Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp , seeking their help to make the government's computing systems more efficient. [nL1N1JG12V]

He will meet with energy industry leaders next week.

"We want them to create new companies and lots of jobs," Trump told the executives on Thursday. "We're going to give you the competitive advantage that you need."

In attendance were chief executives of several drone companies including Kespry Inc, AirMap, Airspace Inc, Measure UAS Inc, Trumbull Unmanned, and PrecisionHawk Inc.

Drone makers argued that the administration should move faster to approve broader commercial use of drones and noted that the Transportation Department does not require automakers to win pre-approval of self-driving vehicle technologies.

Senior executives at Xcel Energy Inc , Verizon Communications Inc and CenturyLink Inc also took part. Venture capital firms included Revolution LLC, headed by AOL co-founder Steve Case, 500 Startups, Cayuga Ventures, Epic Ventures and Lightspeed Ventures.

Obama administration rules opened the skies to low-level small drones for education, research and routine commercial use. The Trump administration is considering whether to expand drone use for deliveries beyond the view of an operator. Security issues would need to be addressed.

The Federal Aviation Administration in March estimated that by 2021 the fleet of small hobbyist drones will more than triple and commercial drones will grow tenfold to about 442,000.

Last year, regulators cleared the way for next-generation 5G wireless networks, with expected speeds at least 10 times and maybe 100 times faster than today's 4G networks. Testing is under way and deployment is expected around 2020 but infrastructure hurdles remain.

Wireless signals need to be much faster and more responsive to allow advanced technologies such as virtual surgery or remote control of machinery. 5G networks could help to wirelessly connect devices such as thermostats or washing machines.

White House aims to speed U.S. drone, wireless technologies - 路透新闻

{{20170622T010001.351+0000}}White House aims to speed U.S. drone, wireless technologiesBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, June 21 (Reuters) - The White House is bringing together drone makers, wireless companies and venture capitalists on Thursday to look at ways government can help speed new technologies to the marketplace.

President Donald Trump will meet with the chief executives of General Electric Co , Honeywell International Inc and AT&T Inc AT&T Inc , major drone industry firms and venture capitalists in the latest effort by the White House to focus on innovative technologies as a way of spurring job growth.

Michael Kratsios, the White House's deputy chief technology officer, told reporters the goal of the sessions is to find ways the United States "can maintain its leadership creating and fostering entirely new technologies that will drive our economic growth." The chief executives of several unmanned aerial system, or drone, companies including Kespry Inc, AirMap, Airspace Inc, Measure UAS Inc, Trumbull Unmanned, and PrecisionHawk Inc are attending the White House sessions.

Senior executives at Xcel Energy Inc , Verizon Communications Inc and CenturyLink Inc are also taking part as are venture capital firms including AOL co-founder Steve Case who heads Revolution LLC, 500 Startups, Cayuga Ventures, Epic Ventures and Lightspeed Ventures.

The administration wants to promote the development and commercialization of emerging technologies and speed the development of unmanned aerial vehicles or drones and 5G wireless technology, Kratsios said.

The Obama administration implemented rules that opened the skies to low-level small drones for education, research and routine commercial use. The Trump administration is considering whether to expand drone use for purposes such as deliveries where aircraft would fly beyond the sight of an operator. Security issues would need to be resolved.

The FAA in March estimated that by 2021 the fleet of small hobbyist drones will more than triple and the commercial drone fleet will increase tenfold to about 442,000.

Last year, the FCC cleared the way for 5G, a lightning-fast next generation of wireless services. Testing is under way and deployment is expected around 2020.

New 5G networks are expected to provide speeds at least 10 times and maybe 100 times faster than today's 4G networks. The next generation of wireless signals needs to be much faster and far more responsive to allow advanced technologies such as virtual surgery or controlling machines remotely, regulators say.

The networks could help wirelessly connect devices such as thermostats or washing machines to facilitate the internet of things.

AIRSHOW-Lockheed upbeat on foreign sales prospects of CH-53K helicopter - 路透新闻

{{20170621T143219.879+0000}}AIRSHOW-Lockheed upbeat on foreign sales prospects of CH-53K helicopterBy Andrea Shalal

PARIS, June 21 (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp sees strong export prospects for the CH-53K heavy-lift helicopter it is building for the U.S. Marine Corps, it said on Wednesday, citing interest from Germany and Israel and potentially Japan in coming years.

Dan Schultz, president of Lockheed's Sikorsky helicopter unit, said the CH-53K King Stallion was performing better than expected in testing and had been approved by the Pentagon for full-rate production ahead of schedule. The Marines expect to declare the CH-53K ready for combat use in 2019.

"Everybody needs heavier-lift helicopters," Schultz, who flew earlier model CH-53 helicopters while serving in the Marines, told reporters at the Paris Airshow.

Schultz declined to estimate how many additional CH-53K helicopters could be sold beyond the 200 aircraft to be bought by the Marines, but industry sources say another 100 aircraft could be sold to U.S. allies and potentially the U.S. Navy.

The German defence ministry is expected later this month or early next to take the first step in an acquisition process for a new heavy-lift helicopter that will pit the CH-53K against Boeing Co's CH-47 Chinook, a twin-engine helicopter that has been in production for decades. It would then release formal requirements next year and award a contract a year later.

Schultz said the CH-53K was a new design that could carry inside an entire pallet or Humvee, a big advantage over earlier models, and 12,200 kg (27,000 lbs) externally - more than triple the external load carrying capacity of the predecessor CH-53E.

He said the cost was currently around $88 million a copy, but Lockheed and the Navy were implementing steps to further lower costs. Foreign orders could also help drive down costs by increasing economic order quantities.

Experts say the cost of the Chinook would be far lower to buy, but it would take more flights to accomplish the same mission, given its lower carrying capacity.

Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Morel, the government's chief test pilot for the aircraft, said pilots and maintainers were consulted heavily before Sikorsky began designing the helicopter, resulting in an aircraft that was much easier to fly and service than other helicopters.

He said the Navy, which oversees Marine Corps aviation, was studying if it could save money and time by eliminating some test points no longer needed given the helicopter's strong performance.

Germany's competition for around 40 aircraft is the first on the horizon, and both Lockheed and Boeing are trying to forge ties with German firms that could provide components for the helicopters, and work on maintenance in coming years.

Israel has asked for pricing and availability for 20 aircraft, but could potentially order more, Schultz said.

In coming years, Japan could also look at orders since it now operates an earlier CH-53 model, Schultz added.

Gene Cunningham, vice president of global sales for Boeing's defence unit, said the CH-47 was a strong contender for the German competition, saying it helped meet Germany's desire for a low-risk, affordable solution.

Other NATO allies include Britain, the Netherlands, Spain and Italy also operate Chinooks, so a decision to buy the CH-47 would make it easier for the German military to operate together with other militaries, Cunningham said in an interview.

"That seems to be a big factor as well with the German government," Cunningham said. "The high availability rate of the aircraft would assure the mission readiness of Germany as a partner."

BREAKINGVIEWS-Trump's CEOs do more listening than influencing - 路透新闻

{{20170621T114054.403+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Trump's CEOs do more listening than influencing(Refiles June 20 item to correct spelling of "border" at end of third paragraph. The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Gina Chon

WASHINGTON, June 21 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Donald Trump's CEOs are getting more listening practice than influence. The U.S. president loves to hobnob with corporate chiefs, but his meetings have been largely a one-way street. Executives can claim some impact on China policy but not yet on immigration, and they got stiffed on climate. The White House forums are still useful.

U.S. leaders have long tapped CEOs for advice, but the self-styled CEO president has taken it to a new level. Trump attends each gathering for on-camera remarks and relishes chumming around with the likes of JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon, former GE chief Jeff Immelt and Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman. At a meeting of tech executives on Monday, Trump jovially claimed that since his election the stock market's capitalization had grown as much as the $3.5 trillion in value represented in the room.

On issues where they agree, such as regulatory reform, there is a symbiotic relationship. The energy and financial sectors have applauded his push to overhaul rules overseeing their industries. The corporate world also supports tax reform. CEOs are urging the administration to not get bogged down by the details, such as a border adjustment tax.

But on issues where they aren't already on the same page, Trump has gone his own way. The Paris climate accord was a stark example. Despite impassioned pleas by IBM's Ginni Rometty and others, Trump announced in June he was pulling out of the deal. Most CEOs stayed on his councils even though many criticized the Paris move.

On immigration, Apple's Tim Cook on Monday pressed Trump on visas for highly skilled foreign workers. The president said he supports comprehensive immigration reform, but he also told corporate chiefs in April: "We are going to be very, very careful on the environment." The long-term fate of children of illegal immigrants in the Dreamers program, which is still under review, will be another test of CEO influence.

They have made some progress in tempering the White House's views on a few issues, including on China. The administration has yet to follow through on imposing high tariffs on Beijing and declined to name it a currency manipulator.

The CEO forums are still worth the time, given the insights gained into the administration's thinking. The White House views on tax reform, infrastructure spending and other issues help company chiefs and their clients prepare for them. It's a major reason to keep riding on the one-way street.

CONTEXT NEWS

- U.S. President Donald Trump met with executives in the technology sector on June 19 to discuss modernizing the government and reducing waste. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella were among the attendees. Several of the executives pressed Trump on the country's need for more highly skilled immigrants. The president ordered a review of visas for such foreign employees to curtail abuse and see if they are hurting American workers.

- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was invited to the meeting but didn't attend due to a scheduling conflict, his company said. Tesla CEO Elon Musk dropped out of the technology council after Trump said on June 1 he was pulling the United States out of the Paris climate accord. Disney CEO Bob Iger quit another White House business advisory council because of the president's Paris decision.

RPT-INSIGHT-Innovators toil to revive Canada oil sands as majors exit - 路透新闻

{{20170620T110104.725+0000}}RPT-INSIGHT-Innovators toil to revive Canada oil sands as majors exit(Repeats without change)

By Nia Williams and Ernest Scheyder

CALGARY, Alberta/HOUSTON, June 19 (Reuters) - In the boreal forests and on the remote prairies of Alberta, a handful of firms are running pilot projects they hope will end a two-decade drought in innovation and stem the exodus of top global energy firms from Canada's oil sands.

They are searching for a breakthrough that will cut the cost of pumping the tar-like oil from the country's vast underground bitumen reservoirs and better compete with the booming shale industry in the United States.

If they fail, a bigger chunk of the world's third-largest oil reserves will stay in the ground. Canada's oil sands sector has become one of the biggest victims of the global oil price crash that began in 2014 when top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia flooded the market with cheap crude to drive out high cost competitors.

This year alone, oil majors have sold over $22.5 billion of assets in Canada's energy industry, and been lured south to invest in the higher returns of U.S. shale.

Joseph Kuhach is among the entrepreneurs in Canada hoping they can turn the tide. He runs a small Calgary-based firm, Nsolv, that is testing the use of solvents to liquefy the bitumen buried in the sands and make it flow as oil.

Kuhach says using solvents can cut 20 to 40 percent from the cost of producing the oil. The technique currently used is to use steam to heat the sands underground to extract the oil.

It's a hard sell, he said, to Canadian producers struggling with low oil prices. They are reluctant to invest in a multi-million dollar technology that is unproven on a commercial scale, he said.

"The comment I hear so often when I am talking to companies is, 'We want to be the very first in line to be second'," said Kuhach. "It's easier to go after incremental improvements that they can back away from with no great cost and no great risk."

Nsolv is winding down a three-year pilot project with Canada's second-largest energy producer Suncor Energy at its Dover oil sands lease in northern Alberta. Suncor is evaluating the results, the firm's spokeswoman Erin Rees said.

Fourth-largest producer Imperial Oil , controlled by ExxonMobil Corp , is also developing solvent technology and has had an ongoing C$100-million pilot project since 2013, the company said.

The caution of oil sands producers stems in part from the unique challenges of operating here, where projects take years to build and require billions of dollars in upfront capital.

The development of the technique using steam two decades ago made Canada's sands the new frontier for the oil industry, and majors were among the firms that flocked to buy in.

Since then, innovation has stalled. That failure, energy-industry entrepreneurs and venture capitalists told Reuters, is rooted in a risk-averse culture that has left oil sands years behind U.S. shale.

The exodus of international oil firms such as Royal Dutch Shell and Statoil ASA from oil sands has made innovation tougher because there are fewer potential customers who might adopt new technology, said Joe Gasca, chairman of Fractal Systems Inc. His firm processes bitumen into higher-quality crude at the wellhead.

Fractal is running a 1,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) test plant in eastern Alberta for third-largest producer Cenovus Energy , which has yet to make a decision on whether to proceed commercially.

DATING AND MARRIAGE

The shale sector moved fast to innovate and cut costs to survive the oil price crash. In 2014, producing oil from most shale fields cost more than the average $60 a barrel needed for a new Canadian oil sands project to make money. Now, there are some shale patches that can make a profit at $15 a barrel. [nL1N1DU2DQ]

It takes months of pumping steam into underground reservoirs before bitumen starts to flow from the oil sands. That makes engineers reluctant to experiment with the delicate balance of heat and pressure.

Shale, by contrast, provides comparatively fertile ground for innovation. The initial investment is a fraction of what the cost of an oil sands project. Relatively easy access encourages competition as the many firms involved look for an edge. Wells can be drilled quickly. The stakes are lower and the scale is smaller if experiments fail.

Drilling longer wells and being better able to pinpoint where in those wells to fracture the rock, among other techniques, have supercharged U.S. shale output in the past two years. That has boosted firms including Noble Energy and Devon Energy and drawn billions of dollars in new private equity investment.[nL1N1HF0L2]

Canadian producers have fewer projects to experiment with and are unwilling to risk their massive upfront investments, said Steve Fisher, chief executive of Calgary-based startup Veerum.

"Shale is like going on a date, the oil sands is like getting married," he said. "The risk for capital is high in the oil sands, you have massive assets that need to complete on time and operate for 40 years to make money."

Veerum's technology cuts capital costs by tracking how accurately a new project sticks to design specifications during construction, reducing the need for costly fixes later.

The company is supported by GE's Zone Startups Calgary, an incubator for new firms in the energy capital of Canada.

Another hurdle to innovation is the lack of sales and marketing expertise in the city's oil industry to carry ideas through to commercial execution, said Marty Reed, chief executive of clean-tech fund Evok Innovations.

"At $100 a barrel it didn't take a sales and marketing genius to sell the product," Reed said. "But if you are a new company trying to get Suncor to adopt a new widget those skills are crucial."

Evok was launched last year with a C$100 million investment from Cenovus and Suncor over 10 years to accelerate development of technologies to cut oil sands costs and emissions.

'INCREMENTAL GAINS'

Since oil prices began falling in 2014, the long-term forecast for oil sands output in 2030 has fallen to 3.7 million bpd, down from 5.2 million bpd, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Current output is around 2.4 million bpd.

Expansion will mostly come from adding units at existing projects, given new projects are unprofitable at current international oil prices of around $45 a barrel.

Canadian oil sands producers recognize that innovation is crucial for their survival, and some firms are spending more.

The country's top energy producer Canadian Natural Resources Ltd allocated C$549 million ($406.97 million) or 14 percent of its 2016 C$3.8 billion capital budget on research and development (R&D), up 4 percent from C$527 million in 2015, when capital spending was higher.

"It's mostly about incremental gains, but we do have some big stuff that could change things," Canadian Natural President Steve Laut told reporters last month, declining to elaborate.

Suncor and Imperial both held R&D spending steady from the previous year while reducing overall capital budgets. Suncor spent C$150 million, or 3 percent of its budget in 2016 on what it calls "step-change technologies", while Imperial spent C$195 million, roughly 17 percent of its budget, company filings showed.

The firms all said they were working on ways to reduce costs and environmental impact. Producers also said new technology is often developed in the field during normal operations and does not necessarily show up in R&D budgets.

A number of producers, including Cenovus and Suncor are looking at ways to add solvents to steam in their commercial operations.

Unlike the solvent-only technique being pitched by Nsolv, this would allow firms to adapt existing thermal plants rather than build new ones, Kuhach said.

Even if pilot steam-and-solvent projects are successful, it would take another three to five years for the technology to spread across the industry, said Dan Wicklum, chief executive of the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance.

Vancouver-based Chrysalix Venture Capital has become more cautious about new oil sands investments since the oil majors pulled out, Chief Executive Wal van Lierop said, but is investing in technologies that may prove valuable to the sector.

"I am really hoping we can get breakthrough technologies, but I don't see them yet," he said.

"Mediocracy will not help. It will be go big or go home."

UPDATE 2-Quebec fund CEO: $2 bln investment in new GE aircraft unit may grow - 路透新闻

{{20170619T215507.888+0000}}UPDATE 2-Quebec fund CEO: $2 bln investment in new GE aircraft unit may grow(Recasts; adds comments from interview, analyst, industry source)

By Allison Lampert

MONTREAL, June 19 (Reuters) - Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec's [CDPDA.UL] chief executive said on Monday the Canadian fund's $2 billion investment with GE Capital Aviation in a new aircraft leasing entity could increase over time.

Canada's second largest pension fund is putting up 90 percent of the equity, along with the debt for the entity, which will be operated by the commercial aircraft financing and leasing business of General Electric Co

"This platform, at $2 billion today, has the potential over time to be meaningfully larger than $2 billion," Caisse Chief Executive Michael Sabia said in a phone interview.

The new entity will focus on the market for high-tech, fuel-efficient narrow-body aircraft, he said. GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS), which is putting up the remaining 10 percent in equity, is one of the world largest aircraft-leasing companies.

"One of the reasons that this transaction has come together is that GE is looking for capital-efficient ways for them to grow their business," Sabia said. "We're providing capital to help them grow and they're providing operating capability to make sure these assets are well-managed."

Sabia said the entity, to be called Einn Volant Aircraft Leasing (EVAL), was looking at fuel-efficient, narrow-body or single-aisle planes, because those planes "move most quickly and most easily among the airlines of the world."

That market includes Airbus's A320neo and Boeing Co's 737 MAX, along with Canadian plane-and-train-maker Bombardier Inc's CSeries.

He added that the Caisse's 30 percent stake in Bombardier's rail division was "completely separate" from the pension fund's $2 billion investment over four years with GE.

One aviation financing industry watcher said it is unlikely that GE Capital Aviation would be interested in the 110- to 130-seat CSeries, since it uses the engine of GE rival Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies .

Sabia, however, said any decision about the financing of a specific aircraft would be a function of airline demand.

"The focus of this platform is working with airlines," Sabia said. "Our openness to financing specific aircraft has everything to do with what the airlines buy."

A Bombardier spokesman could not be reached for comment.

Shares of Bombardier closed up nearly 5 percent on Monday in Toronto trading. Qatar Airways CEO Akbar Al Baker earlier in the day said he was considering the CSeries for a possible new carrier in India.

The CSeries has not secured a new firm order in about a year.

AIRSHOW-Qatar Airways firms up order for 20 737 jets, further options dependent on Italy, India - 路透新闻

{{20170619T145030.011+0000}}AIRSHOW-Qatar Airways firms up order for 20 737 jets, further options dependent on Italy, IndiaPARIS, June 19 (Reuters) - Qatar Airways has firmed up an order for 20 Boeing 737 MAX jets and is awaiting the outcome of possible expansion in Italy and India before deciding whether to exercise further options, the carrier's CEO said on Monday.

Qatar Airways signed a letter of intent for up to 60 narrowbody 737 MAX 8 jets, worth $6.9 billion at list prices, last year.

"We have another 40 options and purchase rights, which we could exercise depending on the way forward with both Meridiana and our Indian carrier," Akbar Al Baker told journalists at the Paris Airshow on Monday.

Qatar Airways has been in talks over a stake in Italian carrier Meridiana and is planning to set up a domestic airline in India.

Al Baker also said the CSeries jet by Bombardier could fit for the domestic Indian carrier.

"Instead of ATRs or Q400s, I could use the CSeries on short-runway destinations in India," he said.

He added Qatar Airways was not interested in larger variants of the 737 MAX because it was ordering A321neo jets.

The carrier has been in talks with Airbus to change an order for A320neos for the larger A321neo variant after problems with the engines made by Pratt & Whitney.

Al Baker said he was close to finalising negotiations with Airbus to switch to the rival Leap engine made by CFM, a joint venture of General Electric and Safran .

AIRSHOW-GECAS orders 100 Airbus A320neo aircraft - 路透新闻

{{20170619T094230.995+0000}}AIRSHOW-GECAS orders 100 Airbus A320neo aircraftPARIS, June 19 (Reuters) - Lessor GECAS has placed an order for 100 Airbus A320neo aircraft, selecting CFM engines, due to be delivered from 2020 to 2024, the companies said on Monday at the Paris Airshow.

The order comes after Boeing unveiled plans for a new version of its rival narrowbody jet on Monday, the 737 MAX 10.

Airbus sales chief John Leahy said he did not view the new Boeing model as a rival to the A321.

"We think the 737 MAX-10 is a competitor to the (MAX)9 and that's why a lot of people are converting," he said.

Airbus CEO Fabrice Bregier added the manufacturer was in talks with several potential customer over a planned upgrade for its A380 superjumbo, dubbed the A380plus.

The new wingtips, unveiled on Sunday, would only be put into production if Airbus received "a large order", he said.

AIRSHOW-GE says planemakers calling for more CFM engines - 路透新闻

{{20170619T073539.417+0000}}AIRSHOW-GE says planemakers calling for more CFM enginesPARIS, June 19 (Reuters) - Major planemakers are asking CFM International to provide an extra 800 engines between 2018 and 2020, spread between the current CFM56 model and the recently introduced LEAP model, the head of GE Aviation said on Monday.

CFM produces engines exclusively for the Boeing 737 MAX family and competes with Pratt & Whitney to provide engines for the Airbus A320neo. It is co-owned by GE Aviation and France's Safran .

Speaking at the Paris Airshow, GE Aviation Chief Executive David Joyce declined to give a breakdown, but said CFM would quicken output of the LEAP engine to keep up with demand.

"That means we slow down the reduction of CFM, come down that slope more slowly, at the same time as we come up the LEAP ramp-up faster," Joyce told reporters.

CFM is sticking with plans to produce 1,400 CFM56 and 500 LEAP engines this year, he said.

Next year it will produce 1,200 LEAP engines, in 2019 it will produce 1,900 and in 2020 it will produce 2,100 engines.

"So it is game on and we feel we are ready," he added.

Safran last year said that CFM aimed to reach an annual production rate of 2,000 engines by 2020.

INSIGHT-Innovators toil to revive Canada oil sands as majors exit - 路透新闻

{{20170619T050033.414+0000}}INSIGHT-Innovators toil to revive Canada oil sands as majors exit(Refiles)

By Nia Williams and Ernest Scheyder

CALGARY, Alberta/HOUSTON, June 19 (Reuters) - In the boreal forests and on the remote prairies of Alberta, a handful of firms are running pilot projects they hope will end a two-decade drought in innovation and stem the exodus of top global energy firms from Canada's oil sands.

They are searching for a breakthrough that will cut the cost of pumping the tar-like oil from the country's vast underground bitumen reservoirs and better compete with the booming shale industry in the United States.

If they fail, a bigger chunk of the world's third-largest oil reserves will stay in the ground. Canada's oil sands sector has become one of the biggest victims of the global oil price crash that began in 2014 when top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia flooded the market with cheap crude to drive out high cost competitors.

This year alone, oil majors have sold over $22.5 billion of assets in Canada's energy industry, and been lured south to invest in the higher returns of U.S. shale.

Joseph Kuhach is among the entrepreneurs in Canada hoping they can turn the tide. He runs a small Calgary-based firm, Nsolv, that is testing the use of solvents to liquefy the bitumen buried in the sands and make it flow as oil.

Kuhach says using solvents can cut 20 to 40 percent from the cost of producing the oil. The technique currently used is to use steam to heat the sands underground to extract the oil.

It's a hard sell, he said, to Canadian producers struggling with low oil prices. They are reluctant to invest in a multi-million dollar technology that is unproven on a commercial scale, he said.

"The comment I hear so often when I am talking to companies is, 'We want to be the very first in line to be second'," said Kuhach. "It's easier to go after incremental improvements that they can back away from with no great cost and no great risk."

Nsolv is winding down a three-year pilot project with Canada's second-largest energy producer Suncor Energy at its Dover oil sands lease in northern Alberta. Suncor is evaluating the results, the firm's spokeswoman Erin Rees said.

Fourth-largest producer Imperial Oil , controlled by ExxonMobil Corp , is also developing solvent technology and has had an ongoing C$100-million pilot project since 2013, the company said.

The caution of oil sands producers stems in part from the unique challenges of operating here, where projects take years to build and require billions of dollars in upfront capital.

The development of the technique using steam two decades ago made Canada's sands the new frontier for the oil industry, and majors were among the firms that flocked to buy in.

Since then, innovation has stalled. That failure, energy-industry entrepreneurs and venture capitalists told Reuters, is rooted in a risk-averse culture that has left oil sands years behind U.S. shale.

The exodus of international oil firms such as Royal Dutch Shell and Statoil ASA from oil sands has made innovation tougher because there are fewer potential customers who might adopt new technology, said Joe Gasca, chairman of Fractal Systems Inc. His firm processes bitumen into higher-quality crude at the wellhead.

Fractal is running a 1,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) test plant in eastern Alberta for third-largest producer Cenovus Energy , which has yet to make a decision on whether to proceed commercially.

DATING AND MARRIAGE

The shale sector moved fast to innovate and cut costs to survive the oil price crash. In 2014, producing oil from most shale fields cost more than the average $60 a barrel needed for a new Canadian oil sands project to make money. Now, there are some shale patches that can make a profit at $15 a barrel. [nL1N1DU2DQ]

It takes months of pumping steam into underground reservoirs before bitumen starts to flow from the oil sands. That makes engineers reluctant to experiment with the delicate balance of heat and pressure.

Shale, by contrast, provides comparatively fertile ground for innovation. The initial investment is a fraction of what the cost of an oil sands project. Relatively easy access encourages competition as the many firms involved look for an edge. Wells can be drilled quickly. The stakes are lower and the scale is smaller if experiments fail.

Drilling longer wells and being better able to pinpoint where in those wells to fracture the rock, among other techniques, have supercharged U.S. shale output in the past two years. That has boosted firms including Noble Energy and Devon Energy and drawn billions of dollars in new private equity investment.[nL1N1HF0L2]

Canadian producers have fewer projects to experiment with and are unwilling to risk their massive upfront investments, said Steve Fisher, chief executive of Calgary-based startup Veerum.

"Shale is like going on a date, the oil sands is like getting married," he said. "The risk for capital is high in the oil sands, you have massive assets that need to complete on time and operate for 40 years to make money."

Veerum's technology cuts capital costs by tracking how accurately a new project sticks to design specifications during construction, reducing the need for costly fixes later.

The company is supported by GE's Zone Startups Calgary, an incubator for new firms in the energy capital of Canada.

Another hurdle to innovation is the lack of sales and marketing expertise in the city's oil industry to carry ideas through to commercial execution, said Marty Reed, chief executive of clean-tech fund Evok Innovations.

"At $100 a barrel it didn't take a sales and marketing genius to sell the product," Reed said. "But if you are a new company trying to get Suncor to adopt a new widget those skills are crucial."

Evok was launched last year with a C$100 million investment from Cenovus and Suncor over 10 years to accelerate development of technologies to cut oil sands costs and emissions.

'INCREMENTAL GAINS'

Since oil prices began falling in 2014, the long-term forecast for oil sands output in 2030 has fallen to 3.7 million bpd, down from 5.2 million bpd, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Current output is around 2.4 million bpd.

Expansion will mostly come from adding units at existing projects, given new projects are unprofitable at current international oil prices of around $45 a barrel.

Canadian oil sands producers recognize that innovation is crucial for their survival, and some firms are spending more.

The country's top energy producer Canadian Natural Resources Ltd allocated C$549 million ($406.97 million) or 14 percent of its 2016 C$3.8 billion capital budget on research and development (R&D), up 4 percent from C$527 million in 2015, when capital spending was higher.

"It's mostly about incremental gains, but we do have some big stuff that could change things," Canadian Natural President Steve Laut told reporters last month, declining to elaborate.

Suncor and Imperial both held R&D spending steady from the previous year while reducing overall capital budgets. Suncor spent C$150 million, or 3 percent of its budget in 2016 on what it calls "step-change technologies", while Imperial spent C$195 million, roughly 17 percent of its budget, company filings showed.

The firms all said they were working on ways to reduce costs and environmental impact. Producers also said new technology is often developed in the field during normal operations and does not necessarily show up in R&D budgets.

A number of producers, including Cenovus and Suncor are looking at ways to add solvents to steam in their commercial operations.

Unlike the solvent-only technique being pitched by Nsolv, this would allow firms to adapt existing thermal plants rather than build new ones, Kuhach said.

Even if pilot steam-and-solvent projects are successful, it would take another three to five years for the technology to spread across the industry, said Dan Wicklum, chief executive of the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance.

Vancouver-based Chrysalix Venture Capital has become more cautious about new oil sands investments since the oil majors pulled out, Chief Executive Wal van Lierop said, but is investing in technologies that may prove valuable to the sector.

"I am really hoping we can get breakthrough technologies, but I don't see them yet," he said.

"Mediocracy will not help. It will be go big or go home."

UPDATE 1-CFM says confident of reaching 500 LEAP deliveries in 2017 - 路透新闻

{{20170617T183046.606+0000}}UPDATE 1-CFM says confident of reaching 500 LEAP deliveries in 2017(Adds comments on future engine design)

PARIS, June 17 (Reuters) - CFM International said on Saturday it was confident of meeting a target of 500 deliveries of LEAP engines by the end of the year despite a recent quality flaw with a component.

Boeing earlier this year briefly suspended 737 MAX test flights while CFM, co-owned by Safran and General Electric , conducted checks after a problem was found in a turbine disc.

Safran and GE have both recently talked of 450-500 engine deliveries but CFM officials told a briefing ahead of the Paris Airshow that they remained committed to the target of 500 and that their level of confidence had not changed.

They said the engine, developed for Boeing and Airbus medium-haul planes, was proving to have higher utilisation rates than a rival model from Pratt & Whitney .

Each one percent in improved utilisation has the same benefit for airline finances as a five percent fuel saving, they said.

CFM also said it expects to have clearance for 180-minute extended operations by the end of June for the Boeing and Airbus versions of its LEAP engine.

That means planes will be able to fly up to three hours away from the nearest airport at any one time, allowing airlines to serve long over-water routes like Hawaii to the U.S. West Coast.

NON-COMMITTAL ON DESIGN

CFM, like rival engine makers Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce , is meanwhile poring over proposals for a new mid-market jetliner from Boeing, seating around 220-270 people.

Many in the industry expect Boeing to opt for an engine with a gear to increase the efficiency of its fan, which produces most of the thrust, especially on take-off.

Pratt & Whitney has introduced such a design to re-enter the civil market after mainly focusing on the U.S. military in recent years. Its Geared Turbofan is now in use on some Airbus and Bombardier jets.

The head of Pratt & Whitney last month warned Rolls-Royce that the use of a gear in its planned Ultrafan engine project could cause a patent dispute, according to Flightglobal.

CFM officials declined on Saturday to be drawn on whether they would offer a similar design for Boeing's new jet, but did not rule out using a gear that one described as generic technology.

"We are not ruling out any architecture. We have no religion on the gear," Executive Vice President Francois Bastin said.

Egypt signs $575 million agreement with GE for 100 locomotives - 路透新闻

{{20170617T160325.822+0000}}Egypt signs $575 million agreement with GE for 100 locomotivesCAIRO, June 17 (Reuters) - Egypt signed a $575 million agreement with General Electric Co on Saturday for GE to provide 100 new multi-use locomotives, 15 years of technical support and spare parts, and maintenance and upgrades of 81 trains, the government said.

Transport Minister Hisham Arafat said in a government statement the first shipment of 25 locomotives would arrive in 2018 as part of a plan to have 25 million tonnes of goods transported via railway by 2022.

The agreement also includes GE carrying out maintenance and upgrades on 81 trains the Egyptian National Railways bought in 2008, and training Egyptian engineers.

GUIDE TO EU MERGER PROCESS

DEADLINES:

The European Commission has 25 working days after a deal is filed for a first-stage review. It may extend that by 10 working days to 35 working days, to consider either a company's proposed remedies or an EU member state's request to handle the case.

Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90 additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working days.

SIMPLIFIED:

Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved.

AIRSHOW-CFM ready to equip possible Boeing mid-market jet - 路透新闻

{{20170616T162808.551+0000}}AIRSHOW-CFM ready to equip possible Boeing mid-market jetPARIS, June 16 (Reuters) - Safran and its U.S. partner General Electric are would be willing to provide engines should Boeing go ahead with a new middle of market jet, the head of Safran's aircraft engine business said on Friday.

"If the programme is launched, we are ready and we have the resources to do it," Olivier Andries said at the Paris Air Forum on Friday, adding Safran would do so within the CFM joint venture with GE .

Andries said it was up to Boeing whether to double-source - to offer a choice of engines to airlines for the plane.

"We would be more comfortable playing in a single source position because of the volumes," Andries said, adding it would allow CFM to make a more aggressive proposal in terms of pricing.

He also said that the CFM Leap engine flies on average an extra hour per day compared to the competing Pratt & Whitney engine and therefore offered airlines more revenue.

The comments prepare the ground for what could be a battle over reliability as well as fuel performance in any future engine competition for the middle of the market plane.

AIRSHOW-Rolls-Royce exec says would weigh up China opportunities - 路透新闻

{{20170616T135311.650+0000}}AIRSHOW-Rolls-Royce exec says would weigh up China opportunitiesPARIS, June 16 (Reuters) - Britain's Rolls-Royce would consider entering the market to provide engines for Chinese aircraft makers if the opportunity arises, an executive at the aerospace engineer said on Friday.

China completed the maiden flight of its home-grown C919 passenger jet last month, entering a battle with Boeing and Airbus .

"We will consider going into the Chinese market when the opportunity arises. That opportunity has not happened yet," Eric Schulz, president of civil aerospace at Rolls-Royce, said at an aerospace conference in Paris.

The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), relies on overseas technology from firms including General Electric , France's Safran , Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp subsidiary UTC Aerospace Systems.

Safran shareholders approve plan to buy Zodiac Aerospace - 路透新闻

{{20170615T164938.293+0000}}Safran shareholders approve plan to buy Zodiac AerospacePARIS, June 15 (Reuters) - Shareholders in Safran on Thursday backed resolutions that will free the French aero engine maker to pursue an agreed takeover of parts maker Zodiac .

The planned merger would create the world's third-largest aerospace supplier after U.S companies United Technologies and General Electric .

Thursday's Safran shareholder vote was a key demand of UK hedge fund TCI, which had waged an intense campaign to block the deal, or at least reshape it.

In May, Zodiac accepted a 15 percent cut in Safran's $9 billion offer after Zodiac profit warnings. [nL8N1IQ1QA]

Safran's original $9 billion offer was weakened by conflicting movements in share prices and a deteriorating industrial performance at Zodiac, though on Wednesday Zodiac eased concerns by reiterating financial targets. [nL8N1JB6JR]

Shareholders in Safran had been asked to vote in favour of two mechanisms that will enable the company to issue new preference shares that would then be convertible in ordinary shares after three years.

Safran says it is confident of resolving Zodiac's industrial problems after visiting its plants, including a British factory blamed for the latest profit downgrade in April.

Safran is offering 25 euros per Zodiac share in cash, down from 29.47 euros previously, or an alternative of preferred shares up to a total of 31.4 percent of the $7.7 billion deal.

Zodiac Aerospace shares closed up 0.9 percent at 23.92 euros. Safran eased 0.2 percent to 77.86 euros.

INSIGHT-Innovators toil to revive Canada oil sands as majors exit - 路透新闻

{{20170619T050033.414+0000}}INSIGHT-Innovators toil to revive Canada oil sands as majors exit(Refiles)

By Nia Williams and Ernest Scheyder

CALGARY, Alberta/HOUSTON, June 19 (Reuters) - In the boreal forests and on the remote prairies of Alberta, a handful of firms are running pilot projects they hope will end a two-decade drought in innovation and stem the exodus of top global energy firms from Canada's oil sands.

They are searching for a breakthrough that will cut the cost of pumping the tar-like oil from the country's vast underground bitumen reservoirs and better compete with the booming shale industry in the United States.

If they fail, a bigger chunk of the world's third-largest oil reserves will stay in the ground. Canada's oil sands sector has become one of the biggest victims of the global oil price crash that began in 2014 when top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia flooded the market with cheap crude to drive out high cost competitors.

This year alone, oil majors have sold over $22.5 billion of assets in Canada's energy industry, and been lured south to invest in the higher returns of U.S. shale.

Joseph Kuhach is among the entrepreneurs in Canada hoping they can turn the tide. He runs a small Calgary-based firm, Nsolv, that is testing the use of solvents to liquefy the bitumen buried in the sands and make it flow as oil.

Kuhach says using solvents can cut 20 to 40 percent from the cost of producing the oil. The technique currently used is to use steam to heat the sands underground to extract the oil.

It's a hard sell, he said, to Canadian producers struggling with low oil prices. They are reluctant to invest in a multi-million dollar technology that is unproven on a commercial scale, he said.

"The comment I hear so often when I am talking to companies is, 'We want to be the very first in line to be second'," said Kuhach. "It's easier to go after incremental improvements that they can back away from with no great cost and no great risk."

Nsolv is winding down a three-year pilot project with Canada's second-largest energy producer Suncor Energy at its Dover oil sands lease in northern Alberta. Suncor is evaluating the results, the firm's spokeswoman Erin Rees said.

Fourth-largest producer Imperial Oil , controlled by ExxonMobil Corp , is also developing solvent technology and has had an ongoing C$100-million pilot project since 2013, the company said.

The caution of oil sands producers stems in part from the unique challenges of operating here, where projects take years to build and require billions of dollars in upfront capital.

The development of the technique using steam two decades ago made Canada's sands the new frontier for the oil industry, and majors were among the firms that flocked to buy in.

Since then, innovation has stalled. That failure, energy-industry entrepreneurs and venture capitalists told Reuters, is rooted in a risk-averse culture that has left oil sands years behind U.S. shale.

The exodus of international oil firms such as Royal Dutch Shell and Statoil ASA from oil sands has made innovation tougher because there are fewer potential customers who might adopt new technology, said Joe Gasca, chairman of Fractal Systems Inc. His firm processes bitumen into higher-quality crude at the wellhead.

Fractal is running a 1,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) test plant in eastern Alberta for third-largest producer Cenovus Energy , which has yet to make a decision on whether to proceed commercially.

DATING AND MARRIAGE

The shale sector moved fast to innovate and cut costs to survive the oil price crash. In 2014, producing oil from most shale fields cost more than the average $60 a barrel needed for a new Canadian oil sands project to make money. Now, there are some shale patches that can make a profit at $15 a barrel. [nL1N1DU2DQ]

It takes months of pumping steam into underground reservoirs before bitumen starts to flow from the oil sands. That makes engineers reluctant to experiment with the delicate balance of heat and pressure.

Shale, by contrast, provides comparatively fertile ground for innovation. The initial investment is a fraction of what the cost of an oil sands project. Relatively easy access encourages competition as the many firms involved look for an edge. Wells can be drilled quickly. The stakes are lower and the scale is smaller if experiments fail.

Drilling longer wells and being better able to pinpoint where in those wells to fracture the rock, among other techniques, have supercharged U.S. shale output in the past two years. That has boosted firms including Noble Energy and Devon Energy and drawn billions of dollars in new private equity investment.[nL1N1HF0L2]

Canadian producers have fewer projects to experiment with and are unwilling to risk their massive upfront investments, said Steve Fisher, chief executive of Calgary-based startup Veerum.

"Shale is like going on a date, the oil sands is like getting married," he said. "The risk for capital is high in the oil sands, you have massive assets that need to complete on time and operate for 40 years to make money."

Veerum's technology cuts capital costs by tracking how accurately a new project sticks to design specifications during construction, reducing the need for costly fixes later.

The company is supported by GE's Zone Startups Calgary, an incubator for new firms in the energy capital of Canada.

Another hurdle to innovation is the lack of sales and marketing expertise in the city's oil industry to carry ideas through to commercial execution, said Marty Reed, chief executive of clean-tech fund Evok Innovations.

"At $100 a barrel it didn't take a sales and marketing genius to sell the product," Reed said. "But if you are a new company trying to get Suncor to adopt a new widget those skills are crucial."

Evok was launched last year with a C$100 million investment from Cenovus and Suncor over 10 years to accelerate development of technologies to cut oil sands costs and emissions.

'INCREMENTAL GAINS'

Since oil prices began falling in 2014, the long-term forecast for oil sands output in 2030 has fallen to 3.7 million bpd, down from 5.2 million bpd, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. Current output is around 2.4 million bpd.

Expansion will mostly come from adding units at existing projects, given new projects are unprofitable at current international oil prices of around $45 a barrel.

Canadian oil sands producers recognize that innovation is crucial for their survival, and some firms are spending more.

The country's top energy producer Canadian Natural Resources Ltd allocated C$549 million ($406.97 million) or 14 percent of its 2016 C$3.8 billion capital budget on research and development (R&D), up 4 percent from C$527 million in 2015, when capital spending was higher.

"It's mostly about incremental gains, but we do have some big stuff that could change things," Canadian Natural President Steve Laut told reporters last month, declining to elaborate.

Suncor and Imperial both held R&D spending steady from the previous year while reducing overall capital budgets. Suncor spent C$150 million, or 3 percent of its budget in 2016 on what it calls "step-change technologies", while Imperial spent C$195 million, roughly 17 percent of its budget, company filings showed.

The firms all said they were working on ways to reduce costs and environmental impact. Producers also said new technology is often developed in the field during normal operations and does not necessarily show up in R&D budgets.

A number of producers, including Cenovus and Suncor are looking at ways to add solvents to steam in their commercial operations.

Unlike the solvent-only technique being pitched by Nsolv, this would allow firms to adapt existing thermal plants rather than build new ones, Kuhach said.

Even if pilot steam-and-solvent projects are successful, it would take another three to five years for the technology to spread across the industry, said Dan Wicklum, chief executive of the Canadian Oil Sands Innovation Alliance.

Vancouver-based Chrysalix Venture Capital has become more cautious about new oil sands investments since the oil majors pulled out, Chief Executive Wal van Lierop said, but is investing in technologies that may prove valuable to the sector.

"I am really hoping we can get breakthrough technologies, but I don't see them yet," he said.

"Mediocracy will not help. It will be go big or go home."

UPDATE 1-CFM says confident of reaching 500 LEAP deliveries in 2017 - 路透新闻

{{20170617T183046.606+0000}}UPDATE 1-CFM says confident of reaching 500 LEAP deliveries in 2017(Adds comments on future engine design)

PARIS, June 17 (Reuters) - CFM International said on Saturday it was confident of meeting a target of 500 deliveries of LEAP engines by the end of the year despite a recent quality flaw with a component.

Boeing earlier this year briefly suspended 737 MAX test flights while CFM, co-owned by Safran and General Electric , conducted checks after a problem was found in a turbine disc.

Safran and GE have both recently talked of 450-500 engine deliveries but CFM officials told a briefing ahead of the Paris Airshow that they remained committed to the target of 500 and that their level of confidence had not changed.

They said the engine, developed for Boeing and Airbus medium-haul planes, was proving to have higher utilisation rates than a rival model from Pratt & Whitney .

Each one percent in improved utilisation has the same benefit for airline finances as a five percent fuel saving, they said.

CFM also said it expects to have clearance for 180-minute extended operations by the end of June for the Boeing and Airbus versions of its LEAP engine.

That means planes will be able to fly up to three hours away from the nearest airport at any one time, allowing airlines to serve long over-water routes like Hawaii to the U.S. West Coast.

NON-COMMITTAL ON DESIGN

CFM, like rival engine makers Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce , is meanwhile poring over proposals for a new mid-market jetliner from Boeing, seating around 220-270 people.

Many in the industry expect Boeing to opt for an engine with a gear to increase the efficiency of its fan, which produces most of the thrust, especially on take-off.

Pratt & Whitney has introduced such a design to re-enter the civil market after mainly focusing on the U.S. military in recent years. Its Geared Turbofan is now in use on some Airbus and Bombardier jets.

The head of Pratt & Whitney last month warned Rolls-Royce that the use of a gear in its planned Ultrafan engine project could cause a patent dispute, according to Flightglobal.

CFM officials declined on Saturday to be drawn on whether they would offer a similar design for Boeing's new jet, but did not rule out using a gear that one described as generic technology.

"We are not ruling out any architecture. We have no religion on the gear," Executive Vice President Francois Bastin said.

GUIDE TO EU MERGER PROCESS

DEADLINES:

The European Commission has 25 working days after a deal is filed for a first-stage review. It may extend that by 10 working days to 35 working days, to consider either a company's proposed remedies or an EU member state's request to handle the case.

Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90 additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working days.

SIMPLIFIED:

Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved.

AIRSHOW-CFM ready to equip possible Boeing mid-market jet - 路透新闻

{{20170616T162808.551+0000}}AIRSHOW-CFM ready to equip possible Boeing mid-market jetPARIS, June 16 (Reuters) - Safran and its U.S. partner General Electric are would be willing to provide engines should Boeing go ahead with a new middle of market jet, the head of Safran's aircraft engine business said on Friday.

"If the programme is launched, we are ready and we have the resources to do it," Olivier Andries said at the Paris Air Forum on Friday, adding Safran would do so within the CFM joint venture with GE .

Andries said it was up to Boeing whether to double-source - to offer a choice of engines to airlines for the plane.

"We would be more comfortable playing in a single source position because of the volumes," Andries said, adding it would allow CFM to make a more aggressive proposal in terms of pricing.

He also said that the CFM Leap engine flies on average an extra hour per day compared to the competing Pratt & Whitney engine and therefore offered airlines more revenue.

The comments prepare the ground for what could be a battle over reliability as well as fuel performance in any future engine competition for the middle of the market plane.

AIRSHOW-Rolls-Royce exec says would weigh up China opportunities - 路透新闻

{{20170616T135311.650+0000}}AIRSHOW-Rolls-Royce exec says would weigh up China opportunitiesPARIS, June 16 (Reuters) - Britain's Rolls-Royce would consider entering the market to provide engines for Chinese aircraft makers if the opportunity arises, an executive at the aerospace engineer said on Friday.

China completed the maiden flight of its home-grown C919 passenger jet last month, entering a battle with Boeing and Airbus .

"We will consider going into the Chinese market when the opportunity arises. That opportunity has not happened yet," Eric Schulz, president of civil aerospace at Rolls-Royce, said at an aerospace conference in Paris.

The C919, made by state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC), relies on overseas technology from firms including General Electric , France's Safran , Honeywell International Inc and United Technologies Corp subsidiary UTC Aerospace Systems.

Safran shareholders approve plan to buy Zodiac Aerospace - 路透新闻

{{20170615T164938.293+0000}}Safran shareholders approve plan to buy Zodiac AerospacePARIS, June 15 (Reuters) - Shareholders in Safran on Thursday backed resolutions that will free the French aero engine maker to pursue an agreed takeover of parts maker Zodiac .

The planned merger would create the world's third-largest aerospace supplier after U.S companies United Technologies and General Electric .

Thursday's Safran shareholder vote was a key demand of UK hedge fund TCI, which had waged an intense campaign to block the deal, or at least reshape it.

In May, Zodiac accepted a 15 percent cut in Safran's $9 billion offer after Zodiac profit warnings. [nL8N1IQ1QA]

Safran's original $9 billion offer was weakened by conflicting movements in share prices and a deteriorating industrial performance at Zodiac, though on Wednesday Zodiac eased concerns by reiterating financial targets. [nL8N1JB6JR]

Shareholders in Safran had been asked to vote in favour of two mechanisms that will enable the company to issue new preference shares that would then be convertible in ordinary shares after three years.

Safran says it is confident of resolving Zodiac's industrial problems after visiting its plants, including a British factory blamed for the latest profit downgrade in April.

Safran is offering 25 euros per Zodiac share in cash, down from 29.47 euros previously, or an alternative of preferred shares up to a total of 31.4 percent of the $7.7 billion deal.

Zodiac Aerospace shares closed up 0.9 percent at 23.92 euros. Safran eased 0.2 percent to 77.86 euros.

EXCLUSIVE-GE begins testing drones to inspect refineries, factories -executive - 路透新闻

{{20170613T050001.144+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-GE begins testing drones to inspect refineries, factories -executiveBy Alwyn Scott

SEATTLE, June 13 (Reuters) - General Electric Co has begun testing autonomous drones and robotic "crawlers" to inspect refineries, factories, railroads and other industrial equipment with an eye on capturing a bigger slice of the $40 billion companies around the globe spend annually on inspections.

In trials with customers, aerial drones and robots are able to move around and inside remote or dangerous facilities while photographing corrosion or taking temperature, vibration or gas readings that can be analyzed by computer algorithms and artificial intelligence, Alex Tepper, head of business development at Avitas Systems, a startup GE formed for this business, told Reuters.

GE is expected to announce the new business, which is focused on the oil and gas, transportation and power sectors, as early as Tuesday at a conference in Berlin, Germany.

GE is not the first to combine artificial intelligence with robots to inspect industrial facilities or processes. IBM Corp said it has been working on systems connected to its Watson artificial intelligence capability for about a year and launched some projects March.

Tests IBM have been conducting include coupling cameras to Watson so they can recognize defects in electronic components zipping through assembly lines in China and Taiwan. Other projects involve acoustic sensors, or training Watson-enabled drones to spot frayed power lines on remote electrical towers. IBM and partner ABB Ltd , the Swedish-Swiss conglomerate, are combining visual inspection with ABB robots.

"This is one of the hottest areas within IoT (Internet of Things) manufacturing," said Bret Greenstein, vice president of IBM Watson internet of things. He declined to cite a potential market size.

GE said its Avitas business will combine computer analytics and artificial intelligence with its knowledge of the industrial systems it builds and its existing inspection business.

"We know this equipment very well so we can program the robots, regardless of type, to gather the information we need for an inspection," Tepper said.

Companies spend about $40 billion annually inspecting plants and equipment within the oil and gas, transportation and power generation sectors, Tepper said. He expects robots will not replace humans, but will extend their reach and lower costs.

Automated crawlers and drones also address shifting demographics. Many inspection engineers are nearing retirement, and few young workers are interested in the field, he said.

UPDATE 8-GE's new CEO Flannery to review portfolio with 'no constraint' - 路透新闻

{{20170612T220139.432+0000}}UPDATE 8-GE's new CEO Flannery to review portfolio with 'no constraint'* Flannery to take over as CEO on Aug. 1, chairman on Dec. 31

* Says he will review portfolio without constraint

* Shares have fallen 30 pct during Immelt's tenure

* Stock ends up 3.6 percent on Monday

(Rewrites, adds background on GE, Flannery)

By Alwyn Scott and Arunima Banerjee

June 12 (Reuters) - General Electric Co's incoming chief executive said he will conduct a swift review of the conglomerate's business portfolio with "no constraint," but signaled no major changes as the company sticks with its strategy of selling software-related services across its many divisions.

The maker of jet engines, power plants, medical scanners and railroad locomotives on Monday named veteran insider John Flannery as its next CEO, taking over from longtime leader Jeff Immelt, who reshaped one of corporate America's icons to focus more on technology but failed to deliver profit growth fast enough for some investors.

"I'm going to do a fast but deliberate, methodical review of the whole company," Flannery told Reuters in an interview. "The board has encouraged me to come in and look at it afresh."

In an earlier call with investors, he said the review would have "no constraint."

Immelt, who will step aside Aug. 1, led GE for 16 years, steering it through the financial crisis but leaving it worth a third less than when he took over.

GE's shares closed up 3.6 percent at $28.94 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.

Flannery did not mention any specific plans for GE, but said digital efforts will be at the heart of its strategy.

The company has spent billions of dollars building a digital business that marries electronic sensors and analytic computing to industrial equipment, even though those efforts have not yet boosted GE's bottom line as much investors hoped.

GE will make the results of the review public in the fall, but major changes are not needed, Flannery said. "We're not starting from a weak position at all."

The company will press ahead with its target of cutting overhead costs by $2 billion by 2019 and boosting profits to $2 a share next year.

PRESSURE FOR URGENCY

Flannery, a 55-year-old who joined the company 30 years ago and is now the head of its healthcare unit, will also become chairman after Immelt retires on Dec. 31.

Known previously as a dealmaker at GE, Flannery has been credited with nursing that unit back to improving sales and profits by focusing on organic growth. [nL8N1J94AX]

He takes over from 61-year-old Immelt, who succeeded Jack Welch in 2001 and oversaw the divestment of its massive lending unit GE Capital, TV network NBCUniversal, and famed appliances business, shifting the conglomerate's focus toward technology, healthcare and manufacturing.

Despite investing heavily on developing digital products, from sensors in jet engines to augmented reality software, shareholders have been wary of the company's new direction. [nL1N1I41F9]

Since Immelt became CEO, GE's shares have declined 30 percent, while the S&P 500 index more than doubled. That underperformance had some pressing for more urgency.

Activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management bought a stake in GE in October 2015, the largest single investment the firm had ever made, and now worth about $2 billion. Trian immediately pushed for asset sales and cost cuts. Trian declined comment on the CEO change on Monday.

GE said Immelt's departure was not triggered by outside influences and was the culmination of six years of succession planning. It said its board set the summer of 2017 for Immelt's departure as far back as 2013.

The timing was not surprising given the serial underperformance of the stock and "investor fatigue with management's continued perceived ungainly portfolio actions," said Stifel analyst Robert McCarthy.

During Immelt's tenure, GE bought French peer Alstom's power business. On Monday it got U.S. antitrust approval to merge its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes Inc .

Despite Immelt's efforts to kick-start growth, the oldest surviving member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average has struggled to boost sales significantly in the past few quarters. In particular, the company's cash flow has been a cause for concern.

Flannery, who joined GE Capital in 1987, focused on leveraged buyouts and later led the corporate restructuring group. He has also ran GE's India business, its equity business in Latin America and the GE Capital business for Argentina and Chile. His new salary will be $2 million a year, GE said.

UPDATE 2-GE wins U.S. antitrust approval for Baker Hughes deal - 路透新闻

{{20170612T212206.686+0000}}UPDATE 2-GE wins U.S. antitrust approval for Baker Hughes deal(Adds purchaser of divested assets, market conditions, companies' statement, background)

By Diane Bartz

WASHINGTON, June 12 (Reuters) - General Electric Co won U.S. antitrust approval to merge its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes Inc to form a new publicly traded company, the Justice Department said on Monday.

GE and Baker Hughes announced the deal in October, months after Halliburton's effort to buy Baker Hughes collapsed under pressure from the Justice Department.

Under the agreement, GE will combine Baker Hughes with its oil and gas business, creating a company with $23 billion in annual revenue, the companies said.

GE will pay existing Baker Hughes shareholders $7.4 billion for a special dividend.

Following the approval, shares of Baker Hughes added slightly to gains to close up 1.1 percent at $56.16.

Energy service companies like Baker Hughes have scrambled to recover from a two-year rout in global oil prices, which pushed the value of U.S. crude to around $26 per barrel last year. Services companies were among the hardest hit, laying off thousands of workers and idling equipment.

A deal among major global oil producers last year to cut production has helped stabilize prices at about $50 a barrel, spurring drilling activity. In the United States, drillers have added some 513 rigs since last year, more than doubling the number in operation, according to data from Baker Hughes.

GE is already the world's largest oilfield equipment maker, supplying blowout preventers, pumps and compressors used in exploration and production. It has also invested heavily in large data processing services just as the oil industry eyes its potential to boost oil recovery.

Baker Hughes is seen as one of the world leaders in horizontal drilling, chemicals used to frack and other services key to oil production.

The deal was approved on condition that GE sell its Water & Process Technologies business, the department said. The asset sale was required because GE and Baker Hughes are two of four companies that sell refineries the specialized chemicals they need to remove impurities from hydrocarbons, the department said in a court filing.

GE will sell the assets to French waste and water group Suez for $3.4 billion, the company said in a statement.

Baker Hughes has some 35 percent of the market for refinery process chemicals, while GE has about 20 percent, the department said in a court filing.

"Today's milestone represents significant progress toward creating an oil and gas productivity leader," the companies said in a statement.

The European Union approved the deal in late May.

Flannery wins top GE job after nursing growth at healthcare unit - 路透新闻

{{20170612T161747.498+0000}}Flannery wins top GE job after nursing growth at healthcare unitBy Ben Hirschler

June 12 (Reuters) - When John Flannery was chosen to head GE Healthcare in 2014, his background as chief dealmaker for the industrial conglomerate led to speculation GE might consider spinning off its somewhat sickly health business.

In fact, he has nursed it back to improving sales and profits by focusing primarily on organic growth opportunities, and the business remains core to GE.

Flannery will take over General Electric Co from Jeff Immelt, who is stepping aside after 16 years as head of the conglomerate he helped steer through the financial crisis but which is now worth a third less than when he took over. [nL3N1J93DT]

On Flannery's watch, the healthcare unit - best-known for imaging and diagnostics - has also expanded into life sciences, offering a range of services to pharmaceutical and biotech companies.

GE faces tough competition for its medical imaging machines, which include MRI scanners and ultrasound devices, from rivals including Philips and Siemens , as well as younger Asian upstarts.

But a focus on expansion into new markets has helped lift sales at GE Healthcare to $18.3 billion last year, with organic revenue increasing by 5 percent and margins by 100 basis points.

Flannery has worked hard to move GE into newer areas of healthcare like life sciences, where GE has emerged as a significant player in helping with the production of biological drugs and cell therapies.

Such drugs, given by injection or infusion, are a pivotal driver of innovation in the drugs industry, being used to treat complex diseases from rheumatoid arthritis to cancer.

Flannery told Reuters last year he aimed to "double down on life sciences", given this business's large and high-margin opportunities. [nL8N19Z25J]

One of the more innovative ideas launched by GE recently is the design of prefabricated drug factories for making complex biotech medicines, an idea it is pioneering in both China and Ireland.

GE reckons its "off-the-shelf" modular factories are 25 to 50 percent cheaper than the traditional plants and can be constructed in just 18 months rather than the typical three years. [nL8N1BV13Z]

Some analysts continue to question whether healthcare truly fits with mainstay GE industries like power generation and jet engines, but Flannery's elevation suggests the group is not contemplating ditching healthcare any time soon.

In a sign of continuity, GE said Kieran Murphy, who currently heads life sciences, would lead the wider GE Healthcare division - and the company stated bluntly: "Healthcare is a key GE business now and in the future."

BREAKINGVIEWS-GE's CEO choice pushes the boundaries - 路透新闻

{{20170612T141027.548+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-GE's CEO choice pushes the boundaries(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Rob Cox

NEW YORK, June 12 (Reuters Breakingviews) - General Electric has seen the future: it is both stateless and globalist. With the anointment of John Flannery to succeed Jeffrey Immelt as chief executive, the $255 billion industrial titan appears to be doubling down on a strategy that transcends its American roots. Flannery has spent much of his career engineering growth abroad. He's also no stranger to restructuring.

Despite the worldwide upheaval confronting chieftains of multinational companies, Flannery has been dealt a better hand. Immelt took over a GE addicted to finance, willing to prostitute the stellar credit ratings of its world-class manufacturing and engineering capabilities for a quick buck. Over his tenure, which started ominously on Sept. 11, 2001, Immelt did wean the company off $260 billion of financial assets, but only after the crisis forced his hand. He also divested appliances, plastics and media.

For all this reimagining of GE, which included moving the headquarters to Boston and a plunge into the industrial internet, Immelt has been dogged by a poorly performing stock. GE returned $143 billion in dividends to shareholders under his stewardship, but the shares also have tumbled by some 30 percent.

Although Flannery most recently has been running the company's subscale healthcare division, he has pranced across GE's landscape. His corporate bio begins in evaluating risk for leveraged buyouts. Since then, it has been a global grand tour, running businesses across Asia and in India and Argentina. This is evidence of how GE's growth resides in places where thirst for power, transportation, energy and healthcare – all of which GE's products aim to sate – will be in greater demand, even as Immelt professed last year that protectionist tendencies worldwide means "companies must navigate the world on their own."

The Allman Brothers fan will have the difficult task of reassuring executives running GE's divisions, many of whom probably fancied themselves Immelt's rightful successor, that their future is peachy. Immelt's ascension to replace Jack Welch led to defections. Flannery also will need to reassure shareholders, including Nelson Peltz's Trian, whose arrival probably greased the skids for his appointment.

To satisfy these and other constituents, Flannery may have to mine the more radical elements of Immelt's strategy. A merger and spinoff of the oil and gas division with Baker Hughes , for example, creates a separate and listed enterprise where GE calls the shots. That blueprint could have wider application. As the company embarks on localizing geographically, it also could become more of a federation operationally. In that sense, Immelt's murky legacy may be dependent on Flannery.

By Christoph Steitz and Tom Käckenhoff

MUELHEIM-KAERLICH, Germany, June 12 (Reuters) - As head of the Muelheim-Kaerlich nuclear reactor, Thomas Volmar spends his days plotting how to tear down his workplace. The best way to do that, he says, is to cut out humans.

About 200 nuclear reactors around the world will be shut down over the next quarter century, mostly in Europe, according to the International Energy Agency. That means a lot of work for the half a dozen companies that specialise in the massively complex and dangerous job of dismantling plants.

Those firms – including Areva , Rosatom's Nukem Technologies Engineering Services, and Toshiba's <6502.T> Westinghouse – are increasingly turning away from humans to do this work and instead deploying robots and other new technologies.

That is transforming an industry that until now has mainly relied on electric saws, with the most rapid advances being made in the highly technical area of dismantling a reactor's core – the super-radioactive heart of the plant where the nuclear reactions take place.

The transformation of the sector is an engineering one, but companies are also looking to the new technology to cut time and costs in a competitive sector with slim margins.

Dismantling a nuclear power plant can take decades and cost up to 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), depending on its size and age. The cost of taking apart the plant in Muelheim-Kaerlich will be about 800 million euros, according to sources familiar with the station's economics.

Some inroads have already been made: a programmable robot arm developed by Areva has reduced the time it takes to dismantle some of the most contaminated components of a plant by 20-30 percent compared with conventional cutting techniques.

For Areva and rival Westinghouse, reactor dismantling is unlikely to make an impact on the dire financial straits they are mired in at present as it represents just a small part of their businesses, which are dominated by plant-building.

But it nonetheless represents a rare area of revenue growth; the global market for decommissioning services is expected to nearly double to $8.6 billion by 2021, from $4.8 billion last year, according to research firm MarketsandMarkets. Such growth could prove important for the two companies should they weather their current difficulties.

"We're not talking about the kind of margins Apple is making on its iPhone," said Thomas Eichhorn, head of Areva's German dismantling activities. "But it's a business with a long-term perspective."

When reactors were built in the 1970s, they were designed to keep radiation contained inside at all costs, with little thought given to those who might be tearing them down more than 40 years later.

First, engineers need to remove the spent nuclear fuel rods stored in reactor buildings – but only after they've cooled off. At Muelheim-Kaerlich this took about two years in total. Then peripheral equipment such as turbines need to be removed, a stage Muelheim-Kaerlich has begun and which can take several years.

Finally, the reactor itself needs to be taken apart and the buildings demolished, which takes about a decade. Some of the most highly contaminated components are cocooned in concrete and placed in iron containers that will be buried deep underground at some point.

ROBOTS UNDER WATER

While the more mundane tasks, including bringing down the plants' outer walls, are left to construction groups such as Hochtief , it's the dismantling of the reactor's core where more advanced skills matter – and where the use of technology has advanced most in recent years.

Enter companies such as Areva, Westinghouse, Nukem Technologies, GE Hitachi <6501.T> as well as GNS, owned by Germany's four nuclear plant operators. They have all begun using robots and software to navigate their way into the reactor core, or pressure vessel.

"The most difficult task is the dismantling of the reactor pressure vessel, where the remaining radioactivity is highest," said Volmar, who took charge of the RWE-owned Muelheim-Kaerlich plant two years ago. "We leave this to a specialised expert firm."

The vessel – which can be as high as 13 metres and weigh up to 700 tonnes – is hidden deep inside the containment building that is shaped like a sphere to ensure its 30-centimetre thick steel wall is evenly strained in case of an explosion.

The 2011 Fukushima disaster and the Chernobyl accident of 1986 are imprinted in the world's consciousness as examples of the catastrophic consequences of the leakage of radioactive material.

France's Areva recently won the contract to dismantle the pressure vessel internals at Vattenfall's 806 megawatt (MW) Brunsbuettel nuclear plant in Germany, which includes an option for the Swedish utility's 1,402 MW Kruemmel site. [nBw4r1vBma]

There, the group will for the first time use its new AZURo programmable robot arm. It hopes this will help it outstrip rivals in what is the world's largest dismantling market following Germany's decision to close all its last nuclear plants by 2022, in response to the Fukushima disaster.

AZURo operates under water because the liquid absorbs radiation from the vessel components – reducing the risk of leakage and contamination of the surrounding area. The chamber is flooded before its work begins.

Areva's German unit invests about 5 percent of its annual sales, or about 40 million euros, in research and development, including in-house innovation such as AZURo. By comparison, the world's 1,000 largest corporate R&D spenders, on average, spent 4.2 percent last year, according to PwC.

The robot arm technology helped Areva beat Westinghouse by winning tenders to dismantle pressure vessel internals at EnBW's Philippsburg 2 and Gundremmingen 2 blocks, industry sources familiar with the matter said.

Areva and EnBW both declined to comment. Westinghouse – whose U.S. business filed for bankruptcy in March – did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

TIME AND MONEY

Britain's OC Robotics has built the LaserSnake2, a flexible 4.5-metre snake arm, which can operate in difficult spaces and uses a laser to increase cutting speeds – thus reducing the risk of atmospheric contamination. It was tested at the Sellafield nuclear site in west Cumbria last year.

This followed France's Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA), whose laser-based dismantling technology generates fewer radioactive aerosols – a key problem during cutting – than other technologies.

The complexity of the dismantling process is also giving rise to modelling software that maps out the different levels of radiation on plant parts, making it easier to calculate the most efficient sequence of dismantling – the more contaminated parts are typically dealt with first – and gives clarity over what safety containers will be needed to store various components.

GNS, which is jointly owned by E.ON , RWE, EnBW and Vattenfall, is currently helping to dismantle the German Neckarwestheim 1 and Philippsburg 1 reactors, using its software to plan the demolition.

The company also hopes to supply its software services for the dismantling of PreussenElektra's Isar 1 reactor, which is being tendered, and aims to expand to other European countries. "Two things matter: time and money," said Joerg Viermann, head of sales of waste management activities at GNS.

"The less I have to cut, the sooner I will be done and the less I will spend."

By David Shepardson and Susan Heavey

WASHINGTON, June 2 (Reuters) - Several major U.S. companies, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc , JP Morgan Chase & Co and IBM Corp , on Friday said their CEOs will remain in an influential presidential advisory group despite objecting to President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate accord.

Citing the need to stay engaged with the administration, business leaders said they would remain in their advisory roles to continue working to influence White House policies.

Trump, a Republican, on Thursday said he would pull the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, drawing anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry. [nL1N1IY0MV] [nL1N1IZ1BA]

"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," Musk said in a Twitter post on Thursday. He was a member of the business advisory group, known as the President's Strategic and Policy Forum. He also belonged to Trump's manufacturing jobs council.

Asked about CEOs' criticism of the U.S. withdrawal, White House spokesman Sean Spicer on Friday said some companies that expressed support for remaining in the agreement raised concerns about the emissions reduction targets.

Spicer, speaking to reporters at a daily news conference, added he does not know if Trump will replace Musk and Iger on the business council.

A spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc , the largest U.S. retailer, said on Friday that Chief Executive Doug McMillon will remain on the business council.

McMillon said in a Facebook post late on Thursday he was "disappointed in today's news about the Paris Agreement. We think it's important for countries to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."

IBM CEO Ginni Rometty will remain on the council, the company said on Friday as it reaffirmed its support for the Paris accord.

"IBM believes we can make a constructive contribution by having a direct dialogue with the administration – as we do with governments around the world," a company spokeswoman said.

Cleveland Clinic Chief Executive Toby Cosgrove will also remain on the council, a spokeswoman said.

Another prominent chief executive, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co , criticized Trump's decision. The company acknowledged Friday that he would not step down from Trump's business group.

"I absolutely disagree with the administration on this issue, but we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people's lives and protect our environment," Dimon said in a statement.

PepsiCo Inc Chief Executive Indra Nooyi is expected to remain on the council. The company said in a statement on Friday that while it is "disappointed with the announcement, we hope there is a way for the accord to move forward with the U.S. at the table."

'LET'S GET A BETTER DEAL'

Other chief executives also issued statements criticizing the decision to withdraw from the accord, including the heads of Facebook Inc , Alphabet Inc and Goldman Sachs .

General Electric Co CEO Jeff Immelt, who is on Trump's manufacturing council, said on Thursday he was disappointed in the decision and added: "Industry must now lead and not depend on government."

Immelt will remain on the council, a company spokeswoman said on Friday.

AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka, who is also on Trump's manufacturing council, called the withdrawal "a failure of American leadership." A union spokesman said on Friday that Trumka intends to remain on the council to serve "as a voice for working people." Boeing Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg also will remain on the manufacturing council, the company said.

Trump administration officials pushed back against company criticisms in television interviews on Friday.

National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn dismissed concerns about potential economic fallout from the climate deal withdrawal, such as the potential of other countries slapping tariffs on American manufacturers.

In an interview on CNBC on Friday, Cohn said the move was part of the administration's efforts to boost U.S. economic growth and help companies by increasing demand for U.S. goods, along with other efforts targeting regulations, taxes and infrastructure.

"If we can grow our economy, we're going to consume more and more products," he said. "We're going to need more manufacturing in the United States just to deal with domestic consumption."

The issue could resurface later this month when, according to an administration spokesman, the White House plans to hold a June 19 meeting with technology leaders.

Kellyanne Conway, a White House senior adviser, said on Fox News the deal would have "a statistically insignificant impact on the environment."

"If you really cared about that piece, and you're one of these CEOs crowing today, then you would say 'let's get a better deal,'" she said in the interview on Friday, adding that Trump had said he was open to future negotiations. [nL1N1IZ0VE]

Trump created the business advisory group in December before taking office to assist him in making policy decisions. The council is led by Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of Blackstone Group LP .

Blackrock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Thursday he would continue to serve on Trump's business forum, despite reservations about the White House climate decision because he believes he can add to policy discussions and be a voice for investors.

General Motors Co said Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra also would remain on the presidential advisory panel, while it remained unclear whether Ford Motor Co's new chief executive, James Hackett, would join the group.

In February, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] CEO Travis Kalanick quit the business advisory council amid internal pressure over Trump's immigration policies. [nL1N1FN21P]

RPT-Trump withdrawal from climate deal disappoints many U.S. companies - 路透新闻

{{20170602T110501.633+0000}}RPT-Trump withdrawal from climate deal disappoints many U.S. companies(Repeats story that ran late June 1 with no changes to text)

By Emily Flitter and Valerie Volcovici

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday withdrawing the country from the Paris climate accord would stave off an economic crisis and protect American jobs - but many American companies seemed to disagree.

Criticism of his decision rolled in from blue-chip companies like Facebook Inc , Apple Inc , Ford Motor Co and Microsoft Corp , while the response from fossil fuel groups with the most to gain from a relaxation of U.S. carbon emissions standards was muted.

Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger said they would leave White House advisory councils over Trump's decision. [nL3N1IY5QF]

In an interview on Thursday, the president of the World Coal Association, Benjamin Sporton, told Reuters that he had mixed feelings about Trump's announcement, adding he was eager to see a U.S. policy that actively promotes a place for coal in the global energy mix.

"What we really need to see, if the president wants to re-enter the deal, is that he can change the agreement to recognize the role of all sources of energy, including coal," Sporton said, adding his group had described to administration officials the benefits of remaining in the agreement.

The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's biggest trade group, meanwhile, issued a statement saying it had never taken an official position on the Paris accord.

A number of its members, including Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips , had publicly supported the deal.

"For us, our position on the Paris agreement... we need a framework like that to address the risks of climate change," Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods told reporters on the sidelines of the company's annual general meeting on Wednesday. [nL1N1IX15V]

Some other groups expressed measured support for Trump's decision, saying it provided an opportunity to fix problems with the deal.

"Manufacturers support the spirit of the Paris Agreement and the effort to address climate change through a fair international agreement. But as the president has acknowledged, certain elements of this deal were not equitable for U.S. manufacturers," said Ross Eisenberg, vice president for energy and resources policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, in a statement to Reuters.

A spokesman for Peabody Energy Corp , America's largest publicly traded coal miner, had said on Wednesday that the company would support a decision by Trump to withdraw from the Paris deal because the "accord is flawed on a number of levels."

Trump vowed during his campaign to pull the United States out of the Paris deal, arguing the pact would cost the United States trillions of dollars, kill jobs, and stymie economic growth without providing tangible benefit.

His critics have argued, however, that the risks of climate change require action, and that a shift to a low-carbon energy economy can create more jobs than it eliminates.

"A SETBACK"

Spokespeople for other extractive oil and mining groups, like the National Mining Association and the American Fuel & Petrochemicals Manufacturers, declined to comment on Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris accord.

But a number of other business leaders derided it in forceful terms.

"Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world," said Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein in his first-ever tweet. [nL1N1IY2CK]

"Disappointed with today's decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government," tweeted General Electric Co's Jeff Immelt.

Apple's CEO Tim Cook, meanwhile, posted to Twitter: "Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet" and "Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver".

"Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children's future at risk," wrote Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post.

By Valerie Volcovici and Jeff Mason

WASHINGTON, June 2 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday said he would withdraw the United States from the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change, drawing anger and condemnation from world leaders and heads of industry.

Trump, tapping into the "America First" message he used when he was elected president last year, said the Paris accord would undermine the U.S. economy, cost U.S. jobs, weaken American national sovereignty and put the country at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world.

"We're getting out," Trump said at a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden under sunny skies on a warm June day, fulfilling a major election campaign pledge.

"We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us any more. And they won't be," Trump said.

"The same nations asking us to stay in the agreement are the countries that have collectively cost America trillions of dollars through tough trade practices and in many cases lax contributions to our critical military alliance," Trump added.

Republican U.S. congressional leaders backed Trump. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell applauded Trump "for dealing yet another significant blow to the Obama administration's assault on domestic energy production and jobs."

Supporters of the accord, including some leading U.S. business figures, called Trump's move a blow to international efforts to tackle dangers for the planet posed by global warming.

Former Democratic President Barack Obama expressed regret over the pullout from a deal he was instrumental in brokering.

"But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got," Obama added.

Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, said his administration would begin negotiations either to re-enter the Paris accord or to have a new agreement "on terms that are fair to the United States, its businesses, its workers, its people, its taxpayers." He complained in particular about China's terms under the agreement.

International leaders reacted with disappointment, even anger.

"The decision made by U.S. President Trump amounts to turning their backs on the wisdom of humanity. I'm very disappointed... I am angry," Japanese Environment Minister Koichi Yamamoto told a news conference on Friday in an unusually frank tone.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said in a rare joint statement the agreement could not be renegotiated and urged their allies to hasten efforts to combat climate change and adapt. [nL8N1IY6V3]

"While the U.S. decision is disheartening, we remain inspired by the growing momentum around the world to combat climate change and transition to clean growth economies," said Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

A summit between Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and top European Union officials in Brussels on Friday will end with a joint statement - the first ever issued by China and the EU - committing both sides to full implementation of the Paris accord. [nL8N1IY5GG]

Speaking in Berlin a day earlier, Premier Li said China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, would stick to its commitment to fight climate change.

Russia also voiced abiding support for the Paris accord, regardless of the U.S. withdrawal.

"We made the decision to join, and I don't think we will (change) it," Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was quoted as saying by RIA news agency.

In India, one of the world's fastest growing major economies and a growing contributor to pollution, a top advisor to Prime Minister Narendra Modi vouched for intentions to switch to renewable power generation independent of the Paris accord.

"The prime minister is very keen on this," Arvind Panagariya said.

ISOLATED

With Trump's action, the United States will walk away from nearly every other nation in the world on one of the pressing global issues of the 21st century. Syria and Nicaragua are the only other non-participants in the accord, signed by 195 nations in Paris in 2015.

Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, who is the incoming head of the U.N. Climate Change Conferences, which formalised the 2015 pact, said Trump's decision was "deeply disappointing".

Fiji, like many other small island nations, is seen as particularly vulnerable to global warming and a possible rise in ocean levels as a result of melting polar ice.

U.S. business leaders voiced exasperation with the Trump administration.

"Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world," Goldman Sachs Group Inc Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein wrote on Twitter.

Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk and Walt Disney CEO Robert Iger said they would leave White House advisory councils after Trump's move. [nL3N1IY5QF]

Under the Paris accord, which took years to reach, rich and poor countries committed to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases generated by burning fossil fuels that are blamed by scientists for warming the planet.

"I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris," Trump said.

Pittsburgh's mayor, Democrat Bill Peduto, shot back on Twitter that his city, long the heart of the U.S. steel industry, actually embraced the Paris accord.

The spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the action a "major disappointment." The U.N. body that handles climate negotiations said the accord could not be renegotiated based on the request of a single nation. [nL1N1IY268]

Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, speaking in Singapore on Friday, also called the U.S. decision "disappointing... but not at all surprising," adding that Australia remained "committed to our Paris commitments."

South Korea's foreign ministry said in a statement "it is regrettable that the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate accord will undermine international responsibility and efforts to respond to climate change."

'DEVASTATING HARM'

Trump said the United States would stop payments to the U.N. Green Climate Fund, in which rich countries committed billions of dollars to help developing nations deal with floods, droughts and other impacts from climate change.

The White House said it would stick to U.N. rules for withdrawing from the pact. Those rules require a nation to wait three years from the date the pact gained legal force, Nov. 4, 2016, before formally seeking to leave. That country must then wait another year.

Apple CEO Tim Cook expressed disappointment and said in an email to employees that he had spoken with Trump on Tuesday to try to persuade him to stay in the Paris accord. "It wasn't enough," he said.

Other business leaders warned that the U.S. economy would give away technological leadership.

General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt said he was disappointed, adding: "Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government."

Democrats also blasted Trump. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called the decision "one of the worst policy moves made in the 21st century because of the huge damage to our economy, our environment and our geopolitical standing."

The United States had committed to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. The United States accounts for more than 15 percent of total worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, second only to China.

Leading climate scientists say greenhouse gas emissions trap heat in the atmosphere and have caused a warming planet, sea level rise, droughts and more frequent violent storms.

A "Global Trends" report prepared by the U.S. Director of National Intelligence's office, released on Jan. 9, warned that climate change posed security risks because of extreme weather, stress on water and food, and global tensions over how to manage the changes.

Last year was the warmest since records began in the 19th Century, as global average temperatures continued a rise dating back decades that scientists attribute to greenhouse gases.

Frank Rijsberman, Director-General of Seoul based Global Green Growth Institute expected international funding for investment needed to fight climate change would suffer, noting a $1 billion reduction in U.S. funding the Green Climate Fund in South Korea.

Economists said the U.S. withdrawal would potentially cost U.S. jobs. China and the EU both already employ more workers in the renewable energy sector than the United States, according to the data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena).

"Winding back the climate agenda means that the U.S. will be left behind in the clean energy transition as other global players, such as in Europe and China, demonstrate greater commitment to deploying low carbon and job-creating solutions to climate change," said Peter Kiernan, of the Economist Intelligence Unit.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Top U.S. CEOs revolt against reality TV version - 路透新闻

{{20170602T041817.006+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Top U.S. CEOs revolt against reality TV version(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Antony Currie

NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters Breakingviews) - America's top chief executives are in revolt against reality TV's pretender. Donald Trump's ill-informed decision to quit the Paris climate accord drew swift opposition from some of the country's most influential bosses, including the heads of Disney , GE and Goldman Sachs . Losing fellow businessmen this early in the game bodes ill for the administration's economic promises.

Tesla boss Elon Musk carried out his threat to resign from the president's advisory council shortly after Trump made his Rose Garden announcement on Thursday. Disney Chief Bob Iger quickly followed his lead.

Goldman Sachs's Lloyd Blankfein was so incensed he took to Twitter for the first time to decry the decision as "a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world." GE's Jeffrey Immelt echoed the disappointment in his own tweet, saying, "Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government."

That's the kind of language executives usually reserve for left-leaning administrations. For Trump, who styles himself as a CEO president, it amounts to a severe rebuke. The corporate leaders are also, by extension, expressing their disapproval of the GOP-controlled Congress. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, after all, both support Trump's stance on Paris.

Making matters worse is how Trump distorted analysis from NERA to claim that 6.5 million industrial jobs and $3 trillion of GDP would be lost by 2040 if the country stuck with the accord. That was the consultancy's worst-case scenario, one already debunked by the World Resources Institute. But Trump's fondness for it is yet more evidence of his distaste for facts and his preference for clinging to a rose-tinted view of the past rather than preparing America for the economic and environmental challenges of the future. That will stick in the craw of companies like GE and Tesla that are focused on innovative technologies.

Business was quick to rally to Trump's side after his unexpected election victory last November, hoping he would deliver on his promises of tax and regulatory reform. Those initiatives have been stalled, however, by the administration's internal chaos and divisions within the Republican-led Congress. Alienating corporate America over climate change risks leaving those goals even further out of reach.

CONTEXT NEWS

- U.S. President Donald Trump on June 1 said he is pulling the country out of the 2015 Paris accord on combatting climate change. He said the agreement was a bad deal for America, stripping $3 trillion from GDP and costing up to 6.5 million industrial jobs by 2040.

- Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk and Disney boss Robert Iger both resigned from the president's advisory council in protest. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, in his first ever tweet, called the decision "a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world."

- General Electric boss Jeff Immelt tweeted: "Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government."

Trump withdrawal from climate deal gets mixed response from U.S. companies - 路透新闻

{{20170602T011530.236+0000}}Trump withdrawal from climate deal gets mixed response from U.S. companiesBy Emily Flitter and Valerie Volcovici

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday withdrawing the country from the Paris climate accord would stave off an economic crisis and protect American jobs - but many American companies seemed to disagree.

Criticism of his decision rolled in from blue-chip companies like Facebook Inc , Apple Inc , Ford Motor Co and Microsoft Corp , while the response from fossil fuel groups with the most to gain from a relaxation of U.S. carbon emissions standards was muted.

Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger said they would leave White House advisory councils over Trump's decision. [nL3N1IY5QF]

In an interview on Thursday, the president of the World Coal Association, Benjamin Sporton, told Reuters that he had mixed feelings about Trump's announcement, adding he was eager to see a U.S. policy that actively promotes a place for coal in the global energy mix.

"What we really need to see, if the president wants to re-enter the deal, is that he can change the agreement to recognize the role of all sources of energy, including coal," Sporton said, adding his group had described to administration officials the benefits of remaining in the agreement.

The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's biggest trade group, meanwhile, issued a statement saying it had never taken an official position on the Paris accord.

A number of its members, including Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips , had publicly supported the deal.

"For us, our position on the Paris agreement... we need a framework like that to address the risks of climate change," Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods told reporters on the sidelines of the company's annual general meeting on Wednesday. [nL1N1IX15V]

Some other groups expressed measured support for Trump's decision, saying it provided an opportunity to fix problems with the deal.

"Manufacturers support the spirit of the Paris Agreement and the effort to address climate change through a fair international agreement. But as the president has acknowledged, certain elements of this deal were not equitable for U.S. manufacturers," said Ross Eisenberg, vice president for energy and resources policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, in a statement to Reuters.

A spokesman for Peabody Energy Corp , America's largest publicly traded coal miner, had said on Wednesday that the company would support a decision by Trump to withdraw from the Paris deal because the "accord is flawed on a number of levels."

Trump vowed during his campaign to pull the United States out of the Paris deal, arguing the pact would cost the United States trillions of dollars, kill jobs, and stymie economic growth without providing tangible benefit.

His critics have argued, however, that the risks of climate change require action, and that a shift to a low-carbon energy economy can create more jobs than it eliminates.

"A SETBACK"

Spokespeople for other extractive oil and mining groups, like the National Mining Association and the American Fuel & Petrochemicals Manufacturers, declined to comment on Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris accord.

But a number of other business leaders derided it in forceful terms.

"Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world," said Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein in his first-ever tweet. [nL1N1IY2CK]

"Disappointed with today's decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government," tweeted General Electric Co's Jeff Immelt.

Apple's CEO Tim Cook, meanwhile, posted to Twitter: "Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet" and "Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver".

"Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children's future at risk," wrote Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post.

Goldman's Blankfein criticizes U.S decision to leave Paris climate deal - Reuters News

{{20170601T220716.537+0000}}Goldman's Blankfein criticizes U.S decision to leave Paris climate dealBy Olivia Oran

June 1 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein criticized the United States' decision to withdraw from the Paris climate deal in his first message on Twitter Inc since joining the platform six years ago.

"Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world," Blankfein said, adding the hashtag "ParisAgreement."

Goldman spokesman Michael Duvally confirmed that the account is Blankfein's.

Blankfein's former No. 2 Gary Cohn is chief economic adviser to President Donald Trump and was part of a "stay-in" camp that included Trump's daughter Ivanka, Gary Cohn, and Energy Secretary Rick Perry. [nL1N1IX0K6]

Other top executives also criticized the decision to quit the accord, including Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk and General Electric Co CEO Jeff Immelt.

By Roberta Rampton and David Brunnstrom

WASHINGTON, May 31 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump talked trade with Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc during a White House visit on Wednesday and welcomed the signing of business deals worth billions of dollars and the jobs they would create.

The U.S. Commerce Department announced 13 new transactions with Vietnam worth $8 billion, including $3 billion worth of U.S.-produced content that would support more than 23,000 American jobs.

These include deals for General Electric Co worth $5.58 billion for power generation, aircraft engines and services, its largest-ever combined sale in Vietnam.[nL1N1IX17J]

Caterpillar Inc and its dealer in Vietnam also agreed to provide generator management technology for more than 100 generators in Vietnam, the company said.

"They (Vietnam) just made a very large order in the United States - and we appreciate that - for many billions of dollars, which means jobs for the United States and great, great equipment for Vietnam," Trump told reporters at the White House.

The Commerce Department estimate of the deals was considerably less than the $15 billion figure given by Phuc during a speech at the Heritage Foundation, adding that most of the total involved the import of U.S. equipment.

Communist Vietnam has gone from being a Cold War enemy to an important partner for the United States in the Asia-Pacific, where both countries share concerns about China's rising power.

Phuc told Trump the relationship had undergone "significant upheavals in history" but that the two countries were now "comprehensive partners."

Phuc's meeting with Trump makes him the first Southeast Asian leader to visit the White House under the new administration.

TRADE FRICTION

However, while Hanoi and Washington have stepped up security cooperation in recent years, trade has become a potential irritant, with a deficit widening steadily in Vietnam's favor, reaching $32 billion last year, compared with $7 billion a decade earlier.

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said it was important to shrink the U.S. trade deficit with Vietnam but noted that the southeast Asian country of 80 million people was the fastest-growing market for U.S. exports, rising 77 percent since 2014 to $4.4 billion.

"The growth of the middle class and the increasing purchasing power in Vietnam are further incentives to strengthening our long-term trade and investment relationship," Ross said.

Trump, who has had strong words for countries with large trade surpluses with the United States, said he would be discussing trade with Phuc, as well as North Korea.

Washington has been seeking support to pressure North Korea to drop its nuclear and missile programs, which have become an increasing threat to the United States. Hanoi has said it shares concerns about North Korea. [nL1N1I61WZ]

In his Heritage speech, Phuc welcomed Trump's plans to attend the November APEC summit in Hanoi. He called it a sign of U.S. commitment to the region and "an important occasion for the United States to assert its positive role."

In a reference to somewhat warmer ties between Washington and Beijing under Trump, who has been courting China's support on North Korea, Phuc said Vietnam welcomed good relations between the two powers, but hoped these would serve the interest of other nations in the region too.

He urged Washington and Beijing "to act with full transparency and in a responsible manner so as not to impact negatively the region and relations among other nations."

Vietnam's government said on its website Trump and Phuc had agreed to promote defense ties and discussed the possibility of U.S. vessels, including aircraft carriers, visiting Vietnamese ports.

It said they had expressed concern about the South China Sea, where Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei are involved in maritime disputes with China, which claims nearly all the strategic waterway. Taiwan also stakes a claim.

"They emphasized that parties must not take actions accelerating tension such as the militarization of disputed structures," it said, an apparent reference to China's construction work.

"NICE, BUT NOT ENOUGH"

Murray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that while the Trump administration welcomed new business deals with Vietnam, its view was they were "nice, but not enough."

"They want Vietnam to bring some ideas about how to tackle the surplus on an ongoing basis," he said.

On Tuesday, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer expressed concern about the rapid growth of the deficit with Vietnam. He said it was a new challenge for the two countries and he was looking to Phuc to help address it. [nL1N1IX010]

The deficit is Washington's sixth largest and reflects growing imports of Vietnamese semiconductors and other electronics products in addition to more traditional sectors such as footwear, apparel and furniture.

On Tuesday Vietnam's trade minister, Tran Tuan Anh, presented Lighthizer with suggestions to address some U.S. concerns, such as advertising on U.S. social media, electronic payment services and imports of information security and farm products, Vietnam's trade ministry said.

Vietnam was disappointed when Trump ditched the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, of which Hanoi was expected to be one of the main beneficiaries, and focused U.S. trade policy on reducing deficits.

By David Lawder and Alwyn Scott

WASHINGTON/SEATTLE, May 31 (Reuters) - U.S. companies signed business deals with Vietnam worth over $8 billion on Wednesday, including power projects and jet engines from General Electric Co and diesel generator technology from Caterpillar , the Commerce Department said.

The 13 deals were announced as Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc met with U.S. President Donald Trump as part of a three-day, trade-focused trip to the United States.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who has pledged to shrink U.S. trade deficits, said the transactions would include $3.4 billion in U.S. produced content that would support 23,000 jobs.

But the Trump administration still wants more work from Vietnam to bring down a rapidly growing $32 billion trade surplus with the United States, said Murray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

"I heard from U.S. officials ahead of the trip that just signing deals with U.S. companies was nice but not enough," Hiebert said.

GE said on Wednesday it had signed deals in Vietnam worth about $5.58 billion for power generation, aircraft engines and services, its largest single combined sale with the country in GE's history.

GE's agreement with Vietjet Aviation JSC includes 20 jet engines made by CFM International, a joint venture of GE and Safran SA of France. It also includes a 12-year engine service contract for 215 LEAP-1B engines on 100 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft that Vietjet has ordered, GE said.

GE's power unit signed a memorandum of understanding to build two 750-megawatt gas fired turbine power plants in conjunction with state energy group PetroVietnam, using the Blue Whale gas field. [nL4N1F33WP]

GE also signed a joint development agreement to erect an 800-megawatt wind power facility. Partners in the agreement are Phu Cuong Group and International Mainstream Renewable Power, GE said.

Honeywell also signed a $100 million deal to supply VietJet with 98 auxiliary power units for the airline's new fleet of Airbus A320 aircraft, including maintenance for 12 years.

Caterpillar and its dealer in Vietnam, Phu Thai Cat, agreed to provide generator management technology for more than 100 generators in Vietnam, the company said. The technology would allow for remote function monitoring including fuel, temperature and pressure. The value of the Caterpillar deal was not disclosed.

Hilton Worldwide signed a deal worth $650 million to manage a 610-room dual-branded hotel in Vietnam, while port security firm Passport Systems Inc signed a deal worth $1 billion, with $420 million in U.S. content, Commerce said.

WASHINGTON, May 31 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump discussed trade with Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc during a White House visit on Wednesday and welcomed the signing of business deals worth billions of dollars and the jobs they would bring.

General Electric Co said earlier it had signed deals with Vietnam worth about $5.58 billion for power generation, aircraft engines and services, its largest ever single combined sale with the country. [nL1N1IX17J]

"They just made a very large order in the United States - and we appreciate that - for many billions of dollars, which means jobs for the United States and great, great equipment for Vietnam," Trump told reporters at the White House.

Phuc said on Tuesday he would sign deals for U.S. goods and services worth $15 billion to $17 billion during his Washington visit, mainly for high-technology products and for services. [nL1N1IX010]

Communist Vietnam has gone from being a bitter adversary of the United States during the Cold War to an important partner in the Asia-Pacific, where both countries share concerns about China's rising power.

Phuc told Trump the relationship had undergone "significant upheavals in history," but that the two countries were now "comprehensive partners."

However, while Hanoi and Washington have stepped up security cooperation in recent years, trade has become a potential irritant, with a deficit widening steadily in Vietnam's favor, reaching $32 billion last year, compared with $7 billion a decade earlier.

Analysts said that while the Trump administration welcomed new business deals with Vietnam, it wants to see moves on trade.

Murray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington said the view was that deals were "nice, but not enough."

"They want Vietnam to bring some ideas about how to tackle the surplus on an ongoing basis," he said.

Phuc's meeting with Trump makes him the first Southeast Asian leader to visit the White House under the new administration.

It reflected calls, letters, diplomatic contacts and lower-level visits that started long before Trump took office in Washington, where Vietnam retains a lobbyist at $30,000 a month.

GUIDE TO EU MERGER PROCESS

DEADLINES:

The European Commission has 25 working days after a deal is filed for a first-stage review. It may extend that by 10 working days to 35 working days, to consider either a company's proposed remedies or an EU member state's request to handle the case.

Most mergers win approval but occasionally the Commission opens a detailed second-stage investigation for up to 90 additional working days, which it may extend to 105 working days.

SIMPLIFIED:

Under the simplified procedure, the Commission announces the clearance of uncontroversial first-stage mergers without giving any reason for its decision. Cases may be reclassified as non-simplified - that is, ordinary first-stage reviews - until they are approved.
