CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-UAE state fund Mubadala nearly triples net profit in 2016 - 路透新闻

{{20170330T132909.567+0000}}CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-UAE state fund Mubadala nearly triples net profit in 2016(Corrects in para 3 to say the company's comprehensive income in 2015 was a negative 1.3 bln dirhams due to a fall in the market value of some assets)

ABU DHABI, March 30 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi's state-owned Mubadala Development Co [MUDEV.UL], which is merging with fellow Abu Dhabi-owned International Petroleum Investment Company (IPIC), said on Thursday its net profit nearly tripled in 2016.

Mubadala, which is focused on developing Abu Dhabi's economy through local companies such as clean energy firm Masdar and stakes in international players such as General Electric , is among the few state-controlled firms to publish results.

The company reported a net profit of 3.3 billion dirhams ($899 million) for 2016, compared to a net profit of 1.2 billion dirhams in 2015. Its total comprehensive income, which comprises all forms of income, was 4.1 billion dirhams in 2016, recovering from a negative 1.3 billion dirhams in 2015 when the market value of some assets fell.

Its revenues grew to 31.5 billion dirhams in 2016 from 29.7 billion dirhams in the previous year, while income from financial investments, the main driver of its profit totalled 5.4 billion dirhams in 2016 versus 3.4 billion dirhams in 2015.

"It has been a strong year for Mubadala in terms of profits and revenue growth and managing our leverage," Khaldoon al-Mubarak, chief executive & managing director told Reuters.

"We reduced our leverage from 14 percent in 2015 to 11.2 percent end of 2016," he added.

Mubadala's merger with IPIC is due to be fully completed in May and the combined group will have assets of about $125 billion.

GE sole bidder for $2 bln Nigeria rail concession -procurement adviser - 路透新闻

{{20170329T224527.841+0000}}GE sole bidder for $2 bln Nigeria rail concession -procurement adviserBy Alexis Akwagyiram

ABUJA, March 29 (Reuters) - A consortium led by General Electric submitted the only bid for a Nigerian railway concession project worth around $2 billion for two lines connecting northern cities to others in the south, a procurement process adviser said on Wednesday.

Bids had to be submitted by Wednesday.

Nigeria has been looking for partners to overhaul its ageing railway system, built mainly by British colonial rulers before independence in 1960.

Economic growth in Africa's most populous nation has been hampered for decades by the dilapidated road and rail network.

The concession will cover about 3,500 km (2,200 miles) of existing narrow-gauge lines from the southwestern commercial capital, Lagos, to Kano in the north, and southeastern oil hub Port Harcourt to Maiduguri in the northeast.

"We received one bid today," said Fola Fagbule, vice president and co-head of advisory at Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) which ran a procurement process after being appointed lead adviser by the government.

The only bid, led by GE, was in partnership with Transnet [CGETR.UL] of South Africa, Dutch-based APM Terminals and China's Sinohydro Consortium.

Nigeria's upper chamber of parliament, the Senate, said in November it would investigate the railway concession over possible violations by Nigerian officials. [nL8N1D97GZ]

BREAKINGVIEWS-Unilever can take page from GE's activist playbook - 路透新闻

{{20170329T134014.395+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Unilever can take page from GE's activist playbook(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Carol Ryan

LONDON, March 29 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Unilever could become a target for uppity investors. Their reasoning would echo the thinking behind last month's aborted takeover offer by Kraft Heinz for the 139 billion-euro Anglo-Dutch owner of Magnum and Ben & Jerry's ice cream. Its low margins suggest scope for cost cuts, and a conservative balance sheet offers room for increased borrowing. Unilever boss Paul Polman could get ahead of the danger by taking a page from General Electric's playbook and seeking advice from a relatively friendly activist.

Polman and his colleagues have since committed to a review of Unilever's options to "accelerate delivery of value for the benefit of our shareholders" with results promised by early April. European companies may have to get used to this way of thinking. The number of companies in the region publicly targeted in activist campaigns jumped 35 percent in 2016 compared with a year earlier and included eight FTSE 100 Index names, according to Activist Insight.

The mindset may not come naturally, however. GE boss Jeff Immelt set an example in 2013 by inviting Nelson Peltz to speak to top executives. The activist – admittedly among the most long-term and non-confrontational of the breed – later took a stake in the $260 billion company, saying he backed Immelt's strategy. Peltz's Trian Fund Management now owns about $2 billion of GE stock.

Should Polman decide to do something similar, the question is which investor might fit with Unilever's brand of stakeholder capitalism, which considers more constituencies than shareholders alone. Some prominent names are occupied, with Chris Hohn's TCI, for example, campaigning on executive pay at Volkswagen and ValueAct Capital securing a board seat at Rolls-Royce last year.

Peltz himself could be a good fit. He has a record of pushing for change at consumer-goods companies. He holds a big stake in Unilever competitor Procter & Gamble , though. That might suit Polman, who could solicit Peltz's input without much risk he would become too hands-on. But the investor might not want to spend the time if he felt he couldn't eventually buy shares.

Once an activist is involved, it can be tough to keep them satisfied. Pressure from Peltz's Trian played a part in GE's latest cost-cut targets and changes to pay structures, unveiled last week. Yet Unilever's self-help measures aren't likely to keep critics quiet for long, either. Now that Kraft Heinz has prodded Polman, he will have to keep moving.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Consumer goods group Unilever is expected to publish a review of its options to increase shareholder value in early April.

- "The events of the last week have highlighted the need to capture more quickly the value we see in Unilever," the company said in a brief statement on Feb. 22 when the review was announced.

- U.S. food company Kraft Heinz and Unilever said on Feb. 19 that Kraft Heinz had withdrawn its $143 billion proposal to combine the two companies.

- In 2013, GE invited Nelson Peltz, chief executive of hedge fund Trian Partners, to speak to its top executives and several board members with an emphasis on corporate costs.

- Since then, Trian has had several discussions with the industrial group's management about its corporate structure and improving shareholder returns. Trian took a $2.5 billion stake in the company in late 2015.

Online freight firm Freightos raises $25 mln in funding led by GE - 路透新闻

{{20170329T100110.939+0000}}Online freight firm Freightos raises $25 mln in funding led by GETEL AVIV, March 29 (Reuters) - Freightos, an online marketplace for international shipping, said on Wednesday it raised $25 million in funding led by GE Ventures, bringing the company's total funding to date to $50 million.

"This capital raise will help to continue Freightos' rapid expansion," said Zvi Schreiber, founder and chief executive of Freightos, which has headquarters in Jerusalem and an R&D centre in Ramallah.

Launched in July, the Freightos Marketplace had a doubling in orders in the first quarter of 2017 over the previous quarter. It has over 10,000 registered users.

The Freightos Marketplace enables freight companies to sell services online and import/export companies to compare, book, and manage shipments. Freightos digitizes freight operations for companies such as Nippon Express, CEVA Logistics, Hellmann Worldwide Logistics and Sysco Foods.

In August, Freightos acquired WebCargoNet, a Barcelona-based provider of air cargo rate management and eBookings.

Investors in Freightos include Sadara Ventures, a venture capital fund targeting the Palestinian high-tech sector, as well as Israel's Aleph VC, Michigan-based Annox Capital and MSR Capital of Malaysia.

FACTBOX-Toshiba's options in U.S. nuclear bankruptcy - Reuters News

{{20170327T232414.838+0000}}FACTBOX-Toshiba's options in U.S. nuclear bankruptcyBy Tom Hals and Jessica DiNapoli

WILMINGTON, Del./NEW YORK, March 27 (Reuters) - Japanese conglomerate Toshiba Corp is considering putting its Westinghouse Electric Co unit into U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy as soon as Tuesday due to runaway costs at two U.S. nuclear power plant projects, sources have told Reuters. [nL3N1H400X]

The following is a look at the fall-out from a possible Westinghouse bankruptcy filing.

Possible strategies in bankruptcy:

Renegotiate the U.S. projects: Toshiba<6502.T> has guaranteed that Westinghouse will complete four nuclear power plants in Georgia and South Carolina - the first nuclear plants to be built in three decades in the United States.

The projects are being overseen by utilities Southern Co and SCANA Corp and are years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget.

Bankruptcy could give Toshiba leverage to renegotiate the fixed-cost contracts and shift some of the overruns to the utilities. Toshiba has said bankruptcy would allow it to limit its exposure to further cost overruns at the projects. The company has estimated it has contingent liabilities and guarantees of 793.5 billion yen (about $7 billion), nearly 90 percent of which are for the U.S. projects.

Southern Co and SCANA Corp likely would seek damages for breaking the contract.

Sale of Westinghouse:

Toshiba may seek a deal with other nuclear power developers to take over Westinghouse, which also operates a nuclear maintenance and design business. Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse has been foreign-owned since 1999, when it was acquired by British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. Toshiba outbid General Electric Co in 2006 to acquire Westinghouse.

South Korea's KEPCO <015760.KS>, the likeliest suitor for Westinghouse, is holding off from making an approach because of questions about the scale of damage at the unit and political uncertainty in both South Korea and the United States, people with direct knowledge of the matter say. [nL3N1H11LX]

Another company takes over U.S. projects:

Southern Co and SCANA could look to another contractor to finish the work.

SCANA Corp, the parent of South Carolina Electric & Gas, has said in regulatory filings that it is taking steps that would allow it to transfer Westinghouse's intellectual property and software to a new construction team if needed. SCANA also said it could step in and take on the role of general contractor, replacing Westinghouse.

SCANA said in a statement on Monday it is preparing for a variety of outcomes.

Southern said it would hold Westinghouse and Toshiba to their responsibilities under their original agreement.

"It's important to note that the parent company of Westinghouse, Toshiba, has guaranteed the responsibilities of Westinghouse," Southern Co said in a prepared statement. "This remains under a Westinghouse bankruptcy."

Westinghouse declined to comment.

Abandonment by the utilities of one or both projects:

SCANA has said in regulatory filings it could seek to abandon the South Carolina project. In both Georgia and South Carolina, the law allows the utilities to recover their costs through rate increases imposed on power users if abandoning the project is deemed prudent.

The plants:

Westinghouse is constructing two nuclear projects, Vogtle units 3 and 4 in Waynesboro, Georgia, and two units at the V.C. Summer Nuclear Power Station in Fairfield County, South Carolina. Both projects will produce about 2,234 megawatts of electricity. The plants are expected to be the first in the country to use Westinghouse's AP1000 advanced pressured water reactor technology. The design has been promoted as safer, less expensive to build and requires less space.

The two Georgia units were originally expected to start operations in 2016 and 2017 and the South Carolina units in 2016 and 2019. The projects are now expected to be online by the end of 2020, although Scana has said there is "substantial uncertainty" given Westinghouse's performance.

The Vogtle construction was about 36 percent complete in September, according to testimony before Georgia's Public Service Commission. Construction at V.C. Summer is about 31 percent complete, according to Dec. 31 regulatory filing by SCANA.

If Westinghouse misses the deadlines, both utility consortiums would lose federal production tax credits.

Public Service Commissions in both states have approved costs of around $14 billion for each project but the final bill last week estimated V.C. Summer will ultimately cost around $22 billion and Vogtle will cost around $19 billion.

The plant owners:

Vogtle is jointly owned by Southern Co's Georgia Power (45.7 percent), Oglethorpe Power Corp [OGPWR.UL](30 percent), Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (22.7 percent) and Dalton Utilities (1.6 percent).

V.C. Summer is owned 55 percent by SCANA Corp's South Carolina Electric & Gas, or SCE&G, and Santee Cooper, South Carolina's state-owned utility.

Customers served by these utilities companies will help pay for the project.

U.S. Department of Energy Guarantees:

The U.S. Department of Energy issued $8.3 billion in loan guarantees to backstop the funding from the utilities who commissioned the Vogtle projects, it said in a 2015 press release. SCANA did not receive federal loan guarantees for the V.C. Summer plants.

Ratepayers:

Ratepayers in Georgia and South Carolina already have been paying for the financing costs of the unfinished nuclear power plants and will foot the bill for the capital costs when the projects are completed. In Georgia, that will mean rate hikes of 6 percent to 8 percent. In South Carolina, 18 percent of residential users' bills are attributed to the cost of the V.C. Summer plant, according to a regulatory filing.

South Carolina regulators reached a deal with SCANA last year that prevents the utility company from requesting future electricity rate increases, unless certain circumstances are met.

Westinghouse ownership:

Toshiba acquired the majority of Westinghouse in 2006 and owns 87 percent. Kazatomprom of Kazakhstan owns 10 percent and IHI Corp <7013.T> of Japan has 3 percent. In February, Toshiba said IHI was exercising its put option to sell its stake to Toshiba for $157 million. [nT9N1FM03A]

Overseas Projects:

Westinghouse has four AP1000 projects in Sanmen and Haiyang in China that are expected to begin operations this year, and expects to build a series of the reactors in the country [nL8N1BS4B7]. Westinghouse also provides nuclear equipment in Korea and services in Japan and also is trying to salvage a deal to build six AP1000 reactors in southern India. [nL3N1GL37W]

Toshiba's woes also have raised doubts about the Moorside nuclear project in the United Kingdom, which Toshiba is developing with France's Engie . [nL8N1FZ3ZQ] ($1 = 110.7 yen)

RPT-ANALYSIS-How a border tax could divide Boeing and its suppliers - 路透新闻

{{20170324T110002.009+0000}}RPT-ANALYSIS-How a border tax could divide Boeing and its suppliers(Repeats to widen distribution)

By Alwyn Scott

SEATTLE, March 24 (Reuters) - A U.S. tax overhaul proposed by Republican leaders in Congress would deepen divisions between big manufacturers like Boeing Co and the thousands of smaller companies that supply them, according to suppliers and tax and trade experts.

U.S. automakers and other manufacturers that rely on imported components also would be affected by the proposals, which would tax imports at a 20 percent rate, and could split these sectors into winners and losers.

The revamp would heighten existing tensions in the aerospace industry, where Boeing's aggressive cost-cutting driven by fierce competition with European rival Airbus has pushed suppliers to lower prices and source more parts and materials abroad.

Aerospace components often zigzag through multiple countries and companies before reaching Boeing's factories in Washington and South Carolina. U.S.-based suppliers to Boeing would face a tax on their imports of these parts. Boeing, the top exporter among U.S. manufacturers, would export its jetliners tax free.

Boeing and some of its largest suppliers, such as United Technologies Corp , General Electric Co and Honeywell International Inc, which also have substantial exports, favor the Republican tax package.

The plans, laid out in a blueprint last year and which President Donald Trump has spoken about favorably, aim to boost U.S. manufacturing, and include cutting the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and making capital investments immediately deductible.

Lawmakers already are at work drafting a tax bill to introduce by early summer, but it could be delayed if health care changes take longer than expected, according to congressional staff.

SUPPLIERS CONCERNED

If the proposed 20 percent tax on imported goods had been in effect last year, Norfil Complex Machining, a 40-employee company in Pacific, Washington, likely would have paid more for titanium it imports from Russia. The metal goes into parts Norfil makes for Boeing landing gear that get assembled in Japan.

"A lot of Russian titanium goes into planes," said Doren Spinner, Norfil's CEO. His purchase contracts have pricing that adjusts if costs go up, so the tax "would end up affecting what the plane would cost," he says.

Other companies said it would be tough to pass higher costs on, and some might move production to low-cost locations abroad.

"If the taxes are ridiculous, we'd just have to think of something creative," said Paul Doran, a sales manager at Mifa, a subsidiary of Netherlands-based Aalberts Industries NV that makes precision aluminum parts for aerospace, autos and other industries. "I think most companies would be in the same boat."

Colin Frost, chief operating officer at parts and tooling supplier Carr Lane Manufacturing Co in St. Louis, Missouri, said he would consider manufacturing overseas if the tax plan were passed. "We'd end up splitting up the company and I don't think that's necessarily good for the U.S. economy," he said.

Boeing said it was too soon to judge the plan's effects on suppliers and so far it appeared likely to benefit the industry as a whole rather than disrupt the supply chain.

"These assessments will vary by company, and it's premature to speculate or generalize," Boeing spokeswoman Kate Bernard said.

OUTSOURCING CONUNDRUM

Boeing also is part of the American Made Coalition, an industry group that backs Republican tax proposals. [nL2N1GR15M]

Proponents say tax reform also would strengthen the dollar, offsetting the impact of the import tax for suppliers, and would encourage companies to invest in the United States.

The tax overhaul could have cut Boeing's taxable income by an estimated $44.5 billion last year, according to tax experts and a Reuters analysis of Boeing's 2016 deliveries. Two-thirds of Boeing's jetliners were delivered overseas and would be tax exempt. Worth about $89 billion at list prices, they were likely sold at discounts of about 50 percent typical in the industry. Boeing declined to comment on the estimate.

Boeing would face import taxes, too. Its 787 Dreamliner, for example, uses major parts from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd <7011.T>, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd <7270.T>, Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd <7012.T> and Italy's Leonardo SpA .

Boeing also would still pay tax on sales to U.S. airlines and the new tax regime would affect its defense and space businesses, which source and sell globally.

Yet suppliers say Boeing's vigorous cost-saving has pressed many to outsource production to low-cost countries, which now exposes them to a potential border tax.

Supply chains would face renewed pressure under the new tax regime, said David Wireman, managing director and co-head of aerospace and defense at consulting firm AlixPartners.

"The tax on imports proposed by the new administration would certainly affect the complex decisions on choosing suppliers, and likely would cause manufacturers to change some supplier relationships."

UPDATE 1-GE links bonuses to cost-cutting targets after talks with Trian - 路透新闻

{{20170322T152555.720+0000}}UPDATE 1-GE links bonuses to cost-cutting targets after talks with Trian(Adds details, background)

March 22 (Reuters) - General Electric Co said it expected to cut costs and boost operating profit in its industrial unit and linked the bonuses of its senior management to meeting these goals, as it bows to pressure from Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management.

GE, considered a bellwether for the U.S. economy, has been streamlining its operations over several quarters to become a simpler industrial business instead of an unwieldy mix of banking and manufacturing.

The company said on Wednesday it expected industrial structural costs of $23.9 billion in 2017 and $22.9 billion in 2018. GE had reported costs of $24.9 billion in 2016.

Operating profit from the unit is expected to rise 10.5 percent to $17.2 billion in the current year. [nEOLbwxgX6]

GE said 2017 bonuses for Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt and his direct reports at the senior vice president level and above will be raised or lowered by 20 percent depending on whether these targets are met.

For 2018, GE said it would review its performance goals to further align incentives.

The company shed its designation as a non-bank systemically important financial institution after divesting most of its GE Capital business. The change is expected to free about $18 billion in capital, which GE had pledged to return to shareholders through buybacks.

Peltz, through his hedge fund Trian, currently owns 66.8 million shares - less than a 1 percent stake - in GE.

Trian had disclosed an about $2.5 billion investment in the company in October 2015, making it one of the top 10 shareholders at the time. (http://reut.rs/2msGn7S)

"Over the past month, Trian has intensified its dialogue with senior management regarding new initiatives to help ensure that GE can meet its financial commitments," Trian said in a separate statement on Wednesday.

The hedge fund said it had invested in GE in 2015 because it liked the company's industrial businesses and appreciated the move to separate GE Capital, and believed that management would meet its commitment to earn $2.00 per share in 2018.

* Says currently has no plans for significant acquisitions in medical technology but may look at targets in other areas

UPDATE 1-GE links bonuses to cost-cutting targets after talks with Trian - 路透新闻

{{20170322T152555.720+0000}}UPDATE 1-GE links bonuses to cost-cutting targets after talks with Trian(Adds details, background)

March 22 (Reuters) - General Electric Co said it expected to cut costs and boost operating profit in its industrial unit and linked the bonuses of its senior management to meeting these goals, as it bows to pressure from Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management.

GE, considered a bellwether for the U.S. economy, has been streamlining its operations over several quarters to become a simpler industrial business instead of an unwieldy mix of banking and manufacturing.

The company said on Wednesday it expected industrial structural costs of $23.9 billion in 2017 and $22.9 billion in 2018. GE had reported costs of $24.9 billion in 2016.

Operating profit from the unit is expected to rise 10.5 percent to $17.2 billion in the current year. [nEOLbwxgX6]

GE said 2017 bonuses for Chief Executive Officer Jeff Immelt and his direct reports at the senior vice president level and above will be raised or lowered by 20 percent depending on whether these targets are met.

For 2018, GE said it would review its performance goals to further align incentives.

The company shed its designation as a non-bank systemically important financial institution after divesting most of its GE Capital business. The change is expected to free about $18 billion in capital, which GE had pledged to return to shareholders through buybacks.

Peltz, through his hedge fund Trian, currently owns 66.8 million shares - less than a 1 percent stake - in GE.

Trian had disclosed an about $2.5 billion investment in the company in October 2015, making it one of the top 10 shareholders at the time. (http://reut.rs/2msGn7S)

"Over the past month, Trian has intensified its dialogue with senior management regarding new initiatives to help ensure that GE can meet its financial commitments," Trian said in a separate statement on Wednesday.

The hedge fund said it had invested in GE in 2015 because it liked the company's industrial businesses and appreciated the move to separate GE Capital, and believed that management would meet its commitment to earn $2.00 per share in 2018.

Bosch sticks to own technology in face of Intel-Mobileye merger - 路透新闻

{{20170315T145100.752+0000}}Bosch sticks to own technology in face of Intel-Mobileye mergerBERLIN, March 15 (Reuters) - Bosch [ROBG.UL], the world's biggest maker of automotive components, will continue to develop its own visual technology regardless of Intel's $15 billion deal to buy Mobileye , an executive said on Wednesday.

Germany's Bosch competes with Israel's Mobileye, which supplies integrated cameras, chips and software for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that are essential for autonomous driving, and owns about 70 percent of the market.

"We are investing a lot of money in our own video technology and we want to stick with this strategy," Bosch managing board member Dirk Hoheisel, who is in charge of mobility services, told a news conference at the Bosch Connected World exhibition.

The acquisition of Mobileye by Intel, the world's biggest chipmaker, promises to escalate the arms race among carmakers and suppliers to acquire autonomous vehicle technology. The deal was announced on Monday. [nL5N1GQ249]

Bosch Chief Executive Volkmar Denner said it was too early to say what effect the merger would have on the competitive landscape or Bosch's own strategy.

"I can only comment about the two companies as of today. Intel is a major chip supplier and therefore also partner of Bosch. Mobileye today is clearly a competitor," he said.

"What the future merger will bring, we will have to see. We will talk of course to Intel and Mobileye."

Bosch, along with rivals including Autoliv and Continental , have decided to stick to plans to develop their own technology for the current generation of ADAS, unlike for example Valeo , which stopped in-house development and decided to buy Mobileye's products instead.

Bosch also relies on an array of partnerships with software makers including SAP , Software AG , IBM , General Electric and Amazon .

The co-founder of Mobileye as well as the chief executive of chipmaker Nvidia , with whom Bosch has a partnership in on-board computers, are also due to speak at the Bosch exhibition in Berlin.

Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang is expected to give more details on Thursday of the partnership with Bosch, in which they will develop artificial intelligence to guide self-driving cars through complex traffic situations.

The computers will be designed to learn how to use knowledge about the vehicle's surroundings gathered with the help of cameras and sensors to make intelligent decisions about how to act, for example to avoid a pedestrian crossing the road.

The on-board systems to enable fully automated driving are planned to come onto the market from 2020.

"Of course, we still have to prove that an autonomous car does better in driving and has less accidents than a human being... so it's a promise," Denner told the news conference.

UPDATE 1-Boeing, aerospace manufacturers back U.S. tax overhaul - 路透新闻

{{20170314T193309.831+0000}}UPDATE 1-Boeing, aerospace manufacturers back U.S. tax overhaul(Adds detail about Trump position on tax plan)

By Alwyn Scott

SEATTLE, March 14 (Reuters) - Boeing Co and about 90 other aerospace companies are urging Congress to overhaul the U.S. tax system, saying a set of changes Republicans proposed last year - including a big cut in the corporate tax rate - will make them more competitive globally and help create U.S. jobs.

Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg was among those who signed a letter to Republican and Democratic leaders in the U.S. House and Senate that was dated Friday and due to be released publicly on Tuesday, according to the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA).

The support comes as congressional Republicans are developing measures to alter the U.S. tax system, a task they plan to tackle after addressing healthcare, according to several people familiar with the matter.

"We urge you to enact legislation that modernizes our tax system, allows America's businesses to better compete in the global marketplace and encourages job creation and innovation in the United States," said the AIA letter, also signed by the group's CEO, David Melcher.

The changes are based on a blueprint released in June by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican.

Among its key elements, Brady's proposal would cut the U.S. corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, permit immediate deductions for capital investment and introduce a border adjustment tax system that would tax imports into the United States but not tax revenue generated by exports out of the country.

The push on taxes by aerospace companies comes as they face some uncertainty under the administration of President Donald Trump.

The new president lost no time in publicly pressing Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp to lower costs on planes bought by the U.S. government. As they source parts and sell many of their products overseas, aerospace companies also stand to suffer if Trump's aggressive trade policies cause friction with other countries.

Trump has voiced support for the tax reform plan, and spoke favorably about a border tax. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross later said Trump had not endorsed the House Republicans' specific border adjustment tax plan. [nL1N1G81XI] [nL2N1GE0E0]

Drafters of the plan say a tax on imports would increase the value of the dollar, helping offset the cost of imports to U.S. manufacturers by giving them more purchasing power. A stronger dollar would, however, make U.S. goods more expensive for foreign buyers.

Boeing's Muilenburg is AIA chairman this year and was joined in signing the letter by Raytheon Co CEO and AIA vice chairman Thomas Kennedy.

Other companies involved in aerospace manufacturing also signed, including Lockheed Martin, General Electric Co , Northrop Grumman Corp , Honeywell International Inc , Rockwell Collins Inc , Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc , General Dynamics Corp , Harris Corp , International Business Machines Corp and L3 Technologies Inc .

The signatures were gathered at a supplier meeting in Seattle last week, Boeing said. AIA said it has more than 330 members.

Boeing shares were trading at $178.89 in the afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.

Smart condo conundrum: Talk to appliances, or text them? - 路透新闻

{{20170312T230002.438+0000}}Smart condo conundrum: Talk to appliances, or text them?* 24.5 mln voice-first devices to ship this yr, vs 6.5 mln in 2016

* Others using messaging apps to control appliances

* Unified Inbox working with appliance makers vs Amazon, Google

By Jeremy Wagstaff

SINGAPORE, March 13 (Reuters) - In today's so-called smart home, you can dim the lights, order more toothpaste or tell the kids to go to bed simply by talking to a small Wifi-connected speaker, such as Amazon's Echo or Google's Home.

This voice-first market - combining voice with artificial intelligence (AI) - barely existed in 2014. This year, Voice Labs, a consultancy, expects 24.5 million appliances to be shipped.

Other big tech firms have their own plans: Apple is taking its Siri voice assistant beyond its mobile devices to PCs, cars, and the home; Baidu last month bought Raven, billed as China's answer to Amazon's Alexa intelligent personal assistant; and Samsung Electronics <005930.KS> plans to incorporate Viv, its newly acquired virtual assistant, into its phones and home appliances.

But not everyone thinks the future of communicating with the Internet of Things needs to be vocal.

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, for example, was working on Jarvis, his own voice-powered AI home automation, and found he preferred communicating by text because, he wrote, "mostly it feels less disturbing to people around me."

And several major appliance makers have turned to a small Singapore firm, Unified Inbox, which offers a service that can handle ordinary text messages and pass them on to appliances.

With your home added to the contacts list on, say, WhatsApp, a quick text message can "start the coffee machine"; "turn on the vacuum cleaner at 5 p.m."; or "preheat the oven to 200 degrees at 6.30 p.m."

"Think of it as a universal translator between the languages that machines speak ... and us humans," said Toby Ruckert, a German former concert pianist and now Unified Inbox's CEO.

The company is just a small player, funded by private investors, but Ruckert says its technology is patent-backed, has been several years in the making, and has customers that include half of the world's smart appliance makers, such as Bosch [ROBG.UL].

Unified Inbox connects the devices on behalf of the manufacturer, while the consumer can add their appliance by messaging its serial number to a special user account or phone number. It so far supports more than 20 of the most popular messaging apps, as well SMS and Twitter , and controls appliances from ovens to kettles. Other home appliances being tested include locks, garage openers, window blinds, toasters and garden sprinklers, says Ruckert.

"People aren't going to want a different interface for all the different appliances in their home," says Jason Jameson, of IBM , which is pairing its Watson AI supercomputer with Unified Inbox to better understand user messages. They will this week demonstrate the service working with a Samsung Robot Cleaner.

"The common denominator is the smartphone, and even more common is the messaging app," Jameson notes.

"TROJAN HORSE"

There's another reason, Ruckert says, why more than half of the world's smart appliance manufacturers have signed up.

They're worried the big tech companies' one-appliance-controls-all approach will relegate them to commodity players, connecting to Alexa or another dominant platform, or being cast aside if Amazon moves into making its own household appliances.

"Our customers are quite afraid of the likes of Amazon," Ruckert said. "Having a Trojan horse in a customer's home, like Echo, that they must integrate with to stay competitive is a nightmare for them."

An Amazon spokesperson said the company was "excited by the early response by smart home device manufacturers and even more excited by the customer response," but declined to speculate about future plans.

A spokesperson for Bosch said no single company can knit the Internet of Things together, so "there is a need to collaborate and establish ecosystems," such as working with Unified Inbox.

Already the race is on to incorporate other services into these home hubs.

Amazon allows third parties to develop apps, or "skills", for Alexa. It has more than 10,000 of these, with many added in just the past three months. Most are developed by firms using Amazon's software toolkit, and range from telling jokes to ordering food.

And Amazon makes it easy for other hardware makers to incorporate Alexa into their appliances, increasing its reach.

Chinese device maker Lenovo <0992.HK> has embedded Alexa in its speakers, while General Electric has it in a lamp - meaning users can control these devices by voice, and use them to order products from Amazon. LG Electronics <066570.KS> and Huawei are also working on Alexa-enabled devices, Amazon said.

Text messaging, though, may yet break down those walls.

As Zuckerberg noted, the volume of text messages is growing much faster than the number of voice calls. "This suggests that future AI products cannot be solely focused on voice, and will need a private messaging interface as well," he says.

EVEN SMARTER

Some companies are already looking further ahead, and doing away with the need for any human instruction - whether by voice or text - by making machines smarter at learning our habits and anticipating them.

LG, for example, is using deep learning to make its appliances understand and avoid objects in a room, or fill an ice-tray based on a user's cold drink habits.

At Unified Inbox, Ruckert looks ahead to being able to communicate not only with one's own appliances, but with machines elsewhere. Bosch executives in Singapore, for example, have demonstrated how a user could ask a smart CCTV camera how many people were in a particular room.

Ruckert is also working with Singapore's Nanyang Polytechnic to send updates to family members or staff direct from hospital equipment attached to patients.

And smart appliance entrepreneur James Dyson said in a recent interview that the future lies in what he calls "highly intelligent automation".

"For me, the future is making everything happen for you without you being particularly involved in it."

BREAKINGVIEWS-Suez's $3.4 bln GE deal just holds water - 路透新闻

{{20170308T212047.799+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Suez's $3.4 bln GE deal just holds water(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Antony Currie

NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Suez's pricey acquisition from General Electric just about holds water. The French company and its minority partner, Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, are paying $3.4 billion for the U.S. conglomerate's H2O unit. That looks high, but it doesn't mean the deal is a washout for shareholders.

The headline price works out to a frothy 12.5 times GE Water and Process Technologies' earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. That's a good chunk more than the 10.7 times EBITDA Xylem paid for Sensus last year. Worse, that target was a more profitable company, sporting a 19 percent EBITDA margin, whereas the GE division's 13 percent margin is one of the industry's lowest.

That ought to have merited a lower price. There was plenty of competition for the business, though, from rival operators like Honeywell and Pentair as well as from private equity. Suez is also paying for scale, which may seem strange considering its $15 billion of revenue last year was seven times that of GE Water's.

But the deal vaults Suez from 10th largest in industrial water into third place. The 95 billion euro market is one of the more lucrative segments of the water business as companies seek to upgrade their infrastructure to save water and energy. It's also expected to grow around 5 percent a year. That's faster than the municipal market that currently makes up much of Suez's business – and the reason why its revenue growth is almost flat.

Municipalities remain a potential cash cow. Many around the world need to either build or replace their pipes and sewer systems – once political will and economic reality allows. But industry is a bigger market, accounting for as much as a fifth of global water consumption compared with up to 8 percent by humans in cities.

Suez also reckons it can cut $69 million a year of costs, which brings the acquisition multiple down to 10 times EBITDA. Promised revenue synergies, as flighty as they often are, look less impressive: at $200 million a year, they'd add just $26 million to EBITDA, on GE's margin. Luckily, the bigger picture for water should be enough to make this deal flow.

BREAKINGVIEWS-White House's cold shoulder slows economic agenda  - 路透新闻

{{20170308T194751.830+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-White House's cold shoulder slows economic agenda (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Gina Chon

WASHINGTON, March 8 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The White House's cold shoulder could slow Donald Trump's economic agenda. David Nason, chief executive of GE Energy Financial Service , has withdrawn from the running to be vice chair of supervision at the Federal Reserve, the company confirmed on Wednesday. Administration officials declined to offer support after critics noted his role at the Treasury Department in arranging bailouts of the 2008 crisis.

The head of regulatory policy at the Fed is a key post considering the administration's desire to cut red tape on banks. The position has been open since it was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act. Daniel Tarullo has been doing the job unofficially but he is stepping down from the Board of Governors in April.

Nason had the backing of Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs president who heads Trump's National Economic Council and has championed deregulation. But the White House has been focused on executive orders and other priorities, and the administration never publicly endorsed Nason.

That silence left an opening for critics. Nason was one of Hank Paulson's key lieutenants at Treasury during the crisis, and conservatives questioned his involvement in the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Financial-sector lobbyists who want a more radical dismantling of Dodd-Frank voiced their concerns to Senate Republicans, citing Nason's past defense of the legislation. The White House repeatedly declined to comment even as reports of opposition surfaced in the media.

He is not the first nominee to be left hanging in the wind. The administration failed to strongly back Trump's choice for Labor secretary, fast-food CEO Andy Puzder, after Democrats attacked his record of labor violations and worker abuses at Carl's Jr. and Hardee's. He withdrew his name in February. Another Goldmanite, Jim Donovan, is Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's pick for the No. 2 spot but the administration has again been silent amid questions about Donovan's Wall Street ties. And Secretary of State Rex Tillerson still cuts a lonely figure at Foggy Bottom after administration officials nixed his favorite for deputy.

Nason's withdrawal now leaves the White House scrambling after other potential candidates, like Congressman French Hill, declined to be considered for the Fed role. Given Nason's treatment, others with the right qualifications may also think twice about joining the new regime.

CONTEXT NEWS

- David Nason, CEO of GE Energy Financial Service, has told the White House he no longer wants to be considered as vice chair of bank supervision at the Federal Reserve, Bloomberg reported on March 8. The position was created under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act but has remained unfilled. Fed Governor Dan Tarullo, who has been the de facto head of regulatory policy, announced he would be leaving the central bank around April 5.

- Nason was assistant secretary for financial institutions at the Treasury Department during the 2008 financial crisis and worked closely with then-secretary Hank Paulson. Critics lobbied some Republican senators to oppose his Fed candidacy, pointing to his role in the Troubled Asset Relief Program and his defense of the Dodd-Frank Act, which Trump has said he wants to dismantle. The White House repeatedly declined to comment on Nason's candidacy.

UPDATE 2-Suez targets industrial water with $3.4 bln GE Water deal - 路透新闻

{{20170308T185616.410+0000}}UPDATE 2-Suez targets industrial water with $3.4 bln GE Water deal* Suez makes big leap into industrial water treatment

* GE Water deal gives it access to blue-chip customers

* Canadian fund CDPQ takes 30 pct stake in joint venture

* Industrial water sector bigger than municipal market

(Adds detail on other bidder, finance)

By Geert De Clercq

PARIS, March 8 (Reuters) - French waste and water group Suez has boosted its industrial water treatment business with the 3.2 billion euros ($3.4 billion) acquisition of GE Water from General Electric .

The deal will give Suez access to most major industries globally, including food and beverage, oil and gas, power, mining, pharmaceuticals, and micro-electronics and will make it a supplier to blue-chip companies such as Exxon-Mobil, Total, Shell, BASF, Nestle, Cargill, Intel, Samsung and Pfizer.

Chief Executive Jean-Louis Chaussade told reporters on Wednesday the industrial water market was more important than Suez's traditional municipal water market, because industry accounts for 15-20 percent of global water consumption compared with just 5-8 percent for human consumption in cities.

In an all-cash deal, Suez and Canadian fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ) will acquire 100 percent of GE Water's equity and debt through a 70/30 joint venture, to which Suez will contribute its existing industrial water activities. The new business will operate under the Suez brand.

The business will have revenue of about 2 billion euros, compared with Suez's 2016 revenue of 15.3 billion euros, and will employ 10,000 people, of which 7,500 will come from GE.

The industrial water market is worth about 95 billion euros globally and grows about 5 percent per year, Chaussade said.

Chaussade said there had been several rounds of bidding for GE Water, but believed that in the third and final round it was up against U.S. fund Clayton, Dubilier & Rice.

Suez has secured bridge financing for the deal, and may refinance it with a 750 million euro capital increase.

Its main shareholders, Engie , CriteriaCaixa and Caltagirone Group, have confirmed their intention to participate in the capital increase for their pro-rata share, Suez said.

Lead shareholder Engie said the cost of subscribing to the full extent of its 32.6 percent stake would be 240 million euros.

Suez finance chief Christophe Cross said that once the deal was finalised, probably early in the third quarter, Suez would prepare a capital increase.

Suez will also issue a 1.1 billion euro long-term senior bond and 600 million worth of hybrid bonds. CDPQ will contribute 700 million euros of equity to the venture.

Chaussade said Suez expected 200 million euros of revenue synergies per year in the group's water business, but had not included possible synergies between water and waste.

"Cross-selling between our water and waste units will be reinforced, as clients increasingly want environment services that include water and waste treatment," he said.

In the past 12 months, Suez shares have fallen about 13 percent, making them the second-worst perfomer in the Stoxx European Utilities index <.SX6P> after bigger peer Veolia , whose shares are down about 22 percent.

Both firms are trying to diversify into industrial water as their traditional European water business stagnates.

UPDATE 1-Withdrawal of GE's Nason leaves Fed job up in the air - Reuters News

{{20170308T181711.940+0000}}UPDATE 1-Withdrawal of GE's Nason leaves Fed job up in the air(Adds Nason statement and details throughout, changes headline)

By Pete Schroeder and Olivia Oran

March 8 (Reuters) - David Nason, a General Electric executive and former Treasury Department official, has told the White House he is no longer interested in serving as the Federal Reserve's bank supervision chief.

Nason, who heads GE's Energy Financial Services division, had been seen as a leading candidate for the vice chair for supervision position, a critical role in efforts by the administration of President Donald Trump to revamp financial rules.

"Mr. Nason informed the White House that he no longer wished to be considered for the position of Vice Chairman at the Federal Reserve. He plans to pursue opportunities at GE," the company said in a statement on Wednesday.

Nason's withdrawal, first reported by Bloomberg, injects new uncertainty into one of the most closely watched financial openings in Washington. The supervision chief is the most senior rule-writer for Wall Street and has a large say in how leading banks are supervised day to day. [nL1N1FV1A0]

Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst at investment banking and research firm Cowen Group, said Nason's departure is "worrisome" for large banks, as it suggests a "pragmatist" open to providing relief to bigger institutions will not fill the position.

"National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn was unable to get the President to pull trigger and nominate Nason," wrote Seiberg. "If Cohn cannot get a pragmatist into that job, then there is a real risk of an ideologue."

"This could be seen as a victory for the Trumpista wing of the administration and the more hardline segment of the Republican Party," wrote Ian Katz, a financial policy analyst for research firm Capital Alpha Partners, in a note to clients.

In 2008, Nason was a deputy to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson as U.S. regulators tried to stabilize Wall Street and prevent an economic meltdown after the housing market collapsed.

While Nason was the leading contender for the role, congressional Republicans became increasingly unhappy with the idea over the past week or so, sources said. Conservative lawmakers took issue with Nason's involvement as a Treasury Department official in the post-financial crisis bank bailout program, as well as with his voicing of support for the Dodd-Frank financial reform law that came in response to the 2008 financial crisis, they said.

Harvard Law School professor Hal Scott, whose work has focused on financial firms, regulation and capital markets, is still in the mix for the job, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. Scott is director of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, a research group made up of financial industry representatives and academics that has been critical of financial regulations.

Some regional banks are also pushing for French Hill, a Republican Congressman from Arkansas who has community banking experience. However, a spokesman for Hill suggested Wednesday he is not interested in the role.

Other names that have been floated for the role include Richard Davis, the chief executive officer of U.S. Bancorp , former BB&T Corp Chairman John Allison, and Tom Hoenig, vice chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

The position was created by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law after the 2007-09 financial crisis. Though it was never filled, Daniel Tarullo, who announced his resignation in February as Fed governor, took on much of its responsibilities.

When Tarullo leaves the U.S. central bank, on or around April 5, Trump will have three spots on the seven-member Fed Board of Governors he could fill with nominees.

Tarullo's resignation is seen as boosting Trump's plans to ease reforms put in place after the financial crisis. [nL1N1FV1A0]

UPDATE 1-Withdrawal of GE's Nason leaves Fed job up in the air - Reuters News

{{20170308T181711.940+0000}}UPDATE 1-Withdrawal of GE's Nason leaves Fed job up in the air(Adds Nason statement and details throughout, changes headline)

By Pete Schroeder and Olivia Oran

March 8 (Reuters) - David Nason, a General Electric executive and former Treasury Department official, has told the White House he is no longer interested in serving as the Federal Reserve's bank supervision chief.

Nason, who heads GE's Energy Financial Services division, had been seen as a leading candidate for the vice chair for supervision position, a critical role in efforts by the administration of President Donald Trump to revamp financial rules.

"Mr. Nason informed the White House that he no longer wished to be considered for the position of Vice Chairman at the Federal Reserve. He plans to pursue opportunities at GE," the company said in a statement on Wednesday.

Nason's withdrawal, first reported by Bloomberg, injects new uncertainty into one of the most closely watched financial openings in Washington. The supervision chief is the most senior rule-writer for Wall Street and has a large say in how leading banks are supervised day to day. [nL1N1FV1A0]

Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst at investment banking and research firm Cowen Group, said Nason's departure is "worrisome" for large banks, as it suggests a "pragmatist" open to providing relief to bigger institutions will not fill the position.

"National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn was unable to get the President to pull trigger and nominate Nason," wrote Seiberg. "If Cohn cannot get a pragmatist into that job, then there is a real risk of an ideologue."

"This could be seen as a victory for the Trumpista wing of the administration and the more hardline segment of the Republican Party," wrote Ian Katz, a financial policy analyst for research firm Capital Alpha Partners, in a note to clients.

In 2008, Nason was a deputy to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson as U.S. regulators tried to stabilize Wall Street and prevent an economic meltdown after the housing market collapsed.

While Nason was the leading contender for the role, congressional Republicans became increasingly unhappy with the idea over the past week or so, sources said. Conservative lawmakers took issue with Nason's involvement as a Treasury Department official in the post-financial crisis bank bailout program, as well as with his voicing of support for the Dodd-Frank financial reform law that came in response to the 2008 financial crisis, they said.

Harvard Law School professor Hal Scott, whose work has focused on financial firms, regulation and capital markets, is still in the mix for the job, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. Scott is director of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, a research group made up of financial industry representatives and academics that has been critical of financial regulations.

Some regional banks are also pushing for French Hill, a Republican Congressman from Arkansas who has community banking experience. However, a spokesman for Hill suggested Wednesday he is not interested in the role.

Other names that have been floated for the role include Richard Davis, the chief executive officer of U.S. Bancorp , former BB&T Corp Chairman John Allison, and Tom Hoenig, vice chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

The position was created by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law after the 2007-09 financial crisis. Though it was never filled, Daniel Tarullo, who announced his resignation in February as Fed governor, took on much of its responsibilities.

When Tarullo leaves the U.S. central bank, on or around April 5, Trump will have three spots on the seven-member Fed Board of Governors he could fill with nominees.

Tarullo's resignation is seen as boosting Trump's plans to ease reforms put in place after the financial crisis. [nL1N1FV1A0]

FACTBOX-Big U.S. companies with overseas cash pile - 路透新闻

{{20170303T185729.559+0000}}FACTBOX-Big U.S. companies with overseas cash pileMarch 3 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's campaign promise to overhaul corporate taxes has put a
spotlight on $2.6 trillion in profits parked abroad by U.S. companies.

Senior House Republicans are pushing a "border adjustment" tax proposal that favors exports over
imports as part of a plan to overhaul the U.S. tax code.

The main thrust of the proposal, which is under attack from import-heavy businesses but is supported
by large exporters, is to exempt companies from having to pay federal income tax on export revenue.

Profits parked abroad by U.S. companies would be taxed at 3.5 percent to 8.75 percent, payable over
eight years, when repatriated, according to the proposal. [nL2N1GD0ZZ]

BREAKINGVIEWS-Hadas: Enough with the cult of Warren Buffett - 路透新闻

{{20170301T174822.241+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Hadas: Enough with the cult of Warren Buffett(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own. Updates to add graphic link in third paragraph.)

By Edward Hadas

LONDON, March 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Warren Buffett has become a cult object. The 86-year-old chairman of Berkshire Hathaway is venerated for his tremendous investment returns, as well as his folk wisdom and cheerleading for America. But the sage of Omaha deserves as much criticism as adulation.

Over the years, Buffett's stellar reputation has slipped a bit. That's fair on two counts. First, no amount of good-humoured self-deprecation can hide the inability to keep investment returns at the same impressive level at Berkshire Hathaway's ballooned market value of $420 billion. Buffett and his small team may still be good, but their wonder-working days are over.

Back in 2002, the annual total return on Berkshire Hathaway common stock for the previous decade was 20 percent, an astounding 10.6 percentage points higher than the S&P 500 Index. By 2016, the annual gap had shrunk to 1.3 percentage points. That's far better than most active fund managers, but not enough to qualify for oracle status (see graphic http://tmsnrt.rs/2lrAz9k).

Second, while his returns are falling, Buffett's hypocrisy is rising. He keeps playing in the derivatives market, despite calling such instruments "financial weapons of mass destruction". More seriously, his backing for the slash-and-burn style of the Brazilians behind Kraft Heinz – Berkshire owns 27 percent of the company – belies his longstanding reputation as a friend of careful bosses who invest for the long term.

The biggest problem with the cult of Buffett, however, is not at all new. From the beginning, his single-minded interest in beating the market has added little to the economy. It is a poor model for financial capitalism.

When economists try to explain why finance helps the economy, they emphasise the importance of new capital. Companies can use money lent by banks or invested by shareholders to develop new products, build new factories or deliver new services. The financial system is supposed to be a valuable supplement to the main source of funding for investments, the retained profit of existing businesses.

In these explanations, the pro-finance economists have to deal with the awkward fact that most of the activity in both public and private financial markets has little to do with raising new productive capital. In particular, trading in shares of established companies cannot create anything new or valuable for the whole economy.

This activity does offer liquidity to investors, and the ability to sell easily might conceivably encourage investors to provide more capital. Or there may be some value in having outside investors who put pressure on managers. But those are pretty flimsy reasons to laud a zero-sum game. For every percentage point of one investor's outperformance, there has to be a percentage point of underperformance by some other investors. It is a wash for the economy.

That is exactly the game the Buffett has been so good at. Though in his most recent letter to shareholders, he tries to dispel what he considers to be a misapprehension that Berkshire Hathaway ever intends to keep stocks forever, his trick has been to buy low and mostly hold on. He was and probably still is good at finding opportunities, but Buffett's relative gains were inevitably the relative losses of others.

To his credit, Buffett has not squeezed the companies Berkshire Hathaway owns and backs to spew out the maximum cash possible. His hands-off style may even have allowed some of them to invest a higher portion of their profit than, say, some private-equity firms would have countenanced. He boasts in the missive sent on Saturday that Berkshire "ranked first among American businesses in the dollar volume of earnings retained". And although his conglomerate plowed some $13 billion into capital expenditures for operating businesses last year, it was nearly a fifth less than in 2015.

Still, Buffett's favourite type of company is as likely to harm as to help the social-economic fabric. He prefers enterprises with pricing power or friendly regulators, but which do not have to take big risks with rapidly changing technology or fickle tastes. In other words, he likes efficient companies which operate in inefficient markets.

The aborted Kraft Heinz bid for Unilever , warmly backed by Berkshire Hathaway, is typical. The would-be acquirers planned to slash costs far more than prices. Even if they wanted to maintain the Anglo-Dutch target's carefully cultivated image as a friend to developing economies and a supporter of healthy living, the largest portion of any gains would have accrued to investors. Customers would be toward the bottom of the priority list.

Berkshire Hathaway has provided new capital on occasion, most notably during the financial crisis. It extracted excellent, not to say extortionate, terms from Goldman Sachs , General Electric and Bank of America . But the large subsequent gains largely came because the Federal Reserve and U.S. taxpayers stumped up to save the financial system from self-destruction. Buffett, who describes America's "economic dynamism" as "miraculous", looked more like a profiteer than a hero.

The Buffett-worship among investors is based on beating the market, not helping the economy. The enthusiasm would be harmless if investing had no more social importance than, say, football. There is, however, currently a populist fury against a system that does less to promote growth than to augment the wealth of insiders. This is no time for playing games.

UPDATE 2-Suez says GE water treatment business would be a good buy - 路透新闻

{{20170301T103058.374+0000}}UPDATE 2-Suez says GE water treatment business would be a good buy* GE Water good strategic fit says CEO

* Core earnings last year down 3.6 pct, dividend unchanged

* Water, waste margins in Europe remain under pressure

* Share price down 3 pct

(Adds comment by CEO on more cost cutting, share price fall)

By Geert De Clercq

PARIS, March 1 (Reuters) - General Electric's industrial water treatment business which is up for sale would be a good strategic fit for Suez , the French group's chief executive said on Wednesday.

Suez last week confirmed that it might put in a a bid for GE Water, which French media have estimated as being worth anywhere between 2 and 3 billion euros ($2.1-3.2 billion). [nL8N1G8355]

"We are interested in GE Water because its activities are in line with our strategy of boosting industrial water activities, boosting international growth and boosting digital and smart activities," Jean-Louis Chaussade said after Suez reported a drop in underlying profits last year.

He declined to say how Suez would finance a possible acquisition but added that the company would not stray from its target of keeping its net financial debt at around three times core earnings.

The company's shares were down 3 percent at 13.74 euros by 1016 GMT after it posted a 3.6 percent fall in core earnings, due to margin pressures in its core European water and waste treatment businesses and left the dividend payout unchanged for a second year running.

Core earnings at the Water Europe division were down 3.2 percent as a lack of inflation in Europe kept a lid on prices, with French sales volumes down 2 percent, due in part to the termination of its Lille water contract.

Core earnings in Suez's European waste business fell 2.4 percent as prices for recycled ferrous metals and plastics fell and electricity prices hit multi-year lows last year.

Core earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were down 3.6 percent to 2.65 billion euros on revenue up 1.2 percent at 15.3 billion euros. Net income was up 3.1 percent at 420 million euros.

Chaussade said Suez plans 150 million euros worth of cost cuts this year, less than the 180 million saved in 2016, but more than its average annual savings of 120-125 million euros.

"During difficult times we increase our cost-cutting efforts," Chaussade said.

The company proposed an unchanged dividend of 65 cents, after leaving the dividend on 2015 earnings also unchanged. For 2017, it expects to pay at least 65 cents per share. It also expects "slight organic growth in revenue and EBIT" this year and free cash flow of around 1 billion euros.

Asked about a possible alliance with bigger peer Veolia , Chaussade said he did not believe in big merger operations in which Suez would need to sell as many assets as it would want to merge. ($1 = 0.9486 euros)

BREAKINGVIEWS-Harry Potter conjures Japanese growth for Comcast - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20170301T064620.182+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Harry Potter conjures Japanese growth for Comcast(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Quentin Webb

HONG KONG, March 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - With Harry Potter's help, Comcast can conjure up growth in sleepy Japan. The biggest U.S. cable operator is paying 255 billion yen ($2.3 billion) to buy out Goldman Sachs and other partners in Universal Studios Japan. The Osaka theme park's success, thanks partly to the boy wizard, highlights a part of the economy where domestic consumption growth is no illusion.

USJ was briefly listed, but faltered during the financial crisis. It was taken private in a 2009 management buyout backed by Goldman, private equity firm MBK, and Owl Creek, a hedge fund. That gave USJ an enterprise value of just $1.4 billion.

Growth at USJ has raced ahead since, in a manner more befitting the Hogwarts Express than the wider Japanese economy. In dollar terms, sales have roughly doubled since 2008-2009. Visitor numbers are up more than 70 percent - and about nine-tenths of those visitors are Japanese. The latest deal values USJ at $7.5 billion including debt.

Such growth bucks the stereotype of penny-pinching local consumers. Despite Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's efforts to rejuvenate the economy, household consumption fell 1.5 percent in real terms last year, excluding spending on houses, cars, and cash gifts.

The theme park's outperformance is partly the result of USJ's specific strategy. It deliberately targeted young women and families, which has paid off. And the Potter attractions, which opened in 2014, have been a big hit. But cross-country rival Tokyo Disneyland has also fared well. Despite high prices – USJ charges adults 7,600 yen per head – the operators appear insulated against wider economic doldrums.

The new deal consummates a process initiated in late 2015, when Comcast bought 51 percent of USJ for $1.5 billion. That multi-year approach to acquisitions is unusual but will be familiar to Comcast investors, since the company used a similar two-stage deal to buy NBCUniversal from General Electric .

Limited financial disclosure makes it hard to gauge how full a price Comcast is paying. But it can expect continued growth from new Nintendo and Minions attractions coming online soon. The group could also expand geographically, perhaps bringing Harry Potter to Tokyo. And while foreigners now make up just a tenth of visitors, they should be a significant source of future demand growth. Growth in Japanese tourism has already blown past expectations under Abe.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Comcast NBCUniversal said on Feb. 28 it would buy the 49 percent of Universal Studios Japan that it does not already own for 255 billion yen ($2.3 billion). The Osaka theme park includes a Harry Potter area and rides based on Spiderman and Jurassic Park.

- The biggest U.S. cable operator said the deal valued USJ at 840 billion yen including debt. The sellers include Goldman Sachs, former USJ Chief Executive Glenn Gumpel, Asian private equity firm MBK Partners, and U.S. hedge fund Owl Creek Asset Management.

- Comcast agreed to buy 51 percent of USJ in September 2015 for $1.5 billion. This earlier deal gave USJ an enterprise value of 750 billion yen.

- USJ reported sales of 68.5 billion yen in the year ended March 31, 2009, which was then equivalent to about $694 million. For the year ended Dec. 31, 2016, Comcast reported $1.4 billion of consolidated revenue from USJ.
