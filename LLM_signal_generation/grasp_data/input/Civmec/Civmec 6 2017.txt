Bullish Turning Point

Price/Earnings of 8.3 close to historical low

The P/E of 8.3 is 0.3 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

3.17 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 8.3 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.1 is 9.1. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 12.1% is 3.8 times the triple-A bond yield of 3.2%.

- The P/E of 8.3 is 0.3 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.8 times the triple-A bond yield of 3.2%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).

3.18 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

- Coles (COL.AX) traded flat 0 % and now trades at AUD 17.05. Coles has a market capitalisation of AUD 21.7 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Coles is 21.14. Title: Technical Analysis: Coles Group Ltd's Strong Fundamentals Support Bullish Momentum Investors looking for a solid investment opportunity may want to consider Coles Group Ltd (ASX: COLES), a leading Australian retailer with a strong track record of delivering consistent dividends and impressive financial performance. Despite lacking recent news updates, a closer examination of the company's fundamentals reveals a compelling picture of long-term growth potential. Price Performance: A Steady Uptrend Over the past year, Coles has exhibited a steady uptrend, with its share price rising from $14.82 at the end of October 2023 to reach $17.19 at market close on March 4th, 2024. This represents a significant gain of over 18% during this timeframe. Additionally, the stock has reached an all-time high of $18.61 just one month prior, indicating a strong bullish momentum that continues to drive upward pressure on the share price. Fundamental Analysis: Solid Financials Underpin Growth Potential Coles boasts a robust set of financials, with a Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 21.1375 and a Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 6.10733. These ratios suggest that the company's shares are undervalued compared to its peers, presenting a buying opportunity for savvy investors seeking long-term capital appreciation. Moreover, the company's dividend analysis indicates a consistent history of paying out healthy dividends to shareholders. With a payout ratio of 57%, Coles demonstrates a commitment to rewarding its investors while maintaining a sustainable financial position. Technical Outlook: Bullish Signals Abound From a technical standpoint, Coles' chart patterns indicate several bullish signals that support the company's strong fundamentals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 62.67, suggesting that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold – a neutral reading that implies further upside potential. Additionally, the Moving Averages (MA) are trending positively, with both the short-term MA (20-day) and long-term MA (50-day) moving higher in tandem. This alignment suggests that the stock's near-term and long-term trends are aligned, underscoring the strength of Coles' upward momentum. Conclusion: A Compelling Investment Opportunity While there have been no recent news updates on Coles Group Ltd, the company's strong fundamentals and technical indicators paint a clear picture of a solid investment opportunity. With a proven track record of delivering consistent dividends and impressive financial performance, Coles offers a compelling mix of value and growth potential that makes it an attractive addition to any portfolio.

- Woolworths (WOW.AX) traded down -0.18 % and now trades at AUD 33.71. Woolworths has a market capitalisation of AUD 39.3 bn. Title: Woolworths Group's Stake Sale Raises Eyebrows; Technical Analysis Reveals Mixed Signals In a move that has left analysts scratching their heads, Woolworths Group Limited (ASX: WOW) has announced plans to sell a 5% stake in its subsidiary, Endeavour Group, for a whopping AU$468 million. This development comes hot on the heels of the company's 52-week high of AU$40.35, recorded just over a year ago. However, the stock has since experienced a significant downturn, with its current price lingering around AU$33.05. A closer look at the company's historical price movements reveals a mixed bag of signals. On one hand, Woolworths has consistently traded above its 50-day moving average (MA) throughout the past year, indicating a bullish trend. Moreover, the stock has recently bounced off its 200-day MA, which could be an indication of a potential upswing. However, there are also some red flags. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been hovering around the mid-range, suggesting that the stock may be due for a correction. Additionally, the MACD line has been trending below the signal line, which could indicate a loss of momentum. From a technical standpoint, the current price of AU$33.05 represents a significant support level, having held firm several times in the past. A break below this threshold could send the stock tumbling towards its next major support level at AU$30.12, which marks the 52-week low. On the flip side, a successful test of the AU$40.35 resistance level could propel the stock towards its next target at AU$46.80. In light of these findings, investors may want to exercise caution when considering investment in Woolworths Group. While the company's fundamentals appear strong, the recent stake sale and mixed technical signals suggest a degree of uncertainty. It may be wise to wait for further developments before making any decisions.

- Qbe Insurance (QBE.AX) traded down -1.85 % and now trades at AUD 17.17. Qbe Insurance has a market capitalisation of AUD 26.7 bn. Qbe Insurance has a current price to earnings ratio of 13.67. Title: QBE Insurance's Strategic Shift Raises Eyebrows In a move that has left industry watchers scratching their heads, QBE Insurance Group Ltd (ASX:QBE) has announced plans to shutter its own North American middle-market segment. This decision comes hot on the heels of the company's latest financial results, which showed a mixed bag of performance. According to sources, the last known news about QBE Insurance dates back to June 18th, when Grafa.com reported that the company would be closing down its North American middle-market segment. As of yesterday's market close, QBE Insurance's stock closed at AUD 18.05, just a hair below its 52-week high of AUD 18.67, which was recorded on June 6th at 22:00:00. Despite this impressive showing, some analysts have expressed concern over the company's decision to exit the North American middle-market segment. This move could potentially impact QBE Insurance's bottom line, as the segment accounted for a significant portion of the company's revenue. However, others argue that the shift in strategy may be a wise one, given the increasing competition in the insurance industry and the changing needs of consumers. By focusing on other areas, such as specialty lines or emerging markets, QBE Insurance may be able to differentiate itself and stay ahead of the curve. From a technical standpoint, QBE Insurance's stock appears to be trading within a well-established uptrend, with support levels around AUD 17.50 and resistance levels near AUD 18.50. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently hovering around 60, indicating that the stock may be due for a slight pullback before continuing its upward trajectory. Overall, while the decision to exit the North American middle-market segment may raise some eyebrows, it is clear that QBE Insurance is taking a strategic approach to position itself for long-term success. With a strong balance sheet and a proven track record of innovation, investors should keep a close eye on this Australian-based insurer as it navigates these changes and continues to evolve in the ever-changing landscape of the global insurance industry.

- Solgold (SOLG.L) traded down -0.8 % and now trades at GBp 8.97. Current market capitalisation for Solgold is GBp 27.4 bn. Title: Technical Analysis: SolGold's Price Plateaus Despite Lack of Recent News Introduction: SolGold (LSE: SOLG), a mining company focused on copper and gold exploration, has seen its stock experience a period of stability despite the absence of recent news. In this technical analysis, we will examine the current price movement of SolGold and provide insights into potential future trends based on historical data. Current Price Movement: As of June 10th, 2024, SolGold's closing price stands at 9.8 British pounds (GBP), unchanged from the previous day's close. This marks a departure from the volatility observed in earlier months, with the stock trading within a tight range since mid-April. The relative stability in SolGold's price can be attributed to the lack of significant news or events that could impact investor sentiment. Historical Price Performance: Looking back at SolGold's performance over the past year, we see that the stock experienced a notable upswing in late May and early June of 2023, peaking at 19.5 GBP on June 15th, 2023. This surge can be attributed to positive drilling results and increased investor interest in the company's projects. However, the momentum did not sustain, and the stock began to decline in July, reaching a low of 5.67 GBP on March 3rd, 2024. Since then, SolGold's price has been recovering, but at a slow pace. Technical Indicators: Moving Averages (MA): The 50-day MA currently stands at 8.5 GBP, while the 200-day MA is at 12.3 GBP. These levels may serve as support and resistance respectively, should the stock continue to trade within its current range. Relative Strength Index (RSI): The RSI reading of 48 suggests that SolGold's stock is neither oversold nor overbought, indicating a neutral position. Bollinger Bands: The upper band sits at 11.2 GBP, while the lower band is at 7.8 GBP, reflecting a relatively narrow trading range for the stock. Conclusion: Despite the lack of recent news, SolGold's stock has maintained a stable price level, suggesting that investors remain confident in the company's long-term prospects. However, without any catalysts on the horizon, the stock's near-term outlook appears limited by its current trading range. Should SolGold break above the 12.3 GBP mark, it could signal a bullish reversal and potentially attract new buyers. Conversely, a drop below 7.8 GBP could indicate a bearish shift in market sentiment.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.2%.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings";there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

Press Release article 1 of 4, Source: Company Website, 176 words

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings";there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

Bullish Turning Point

Price/Earnings of 8.3 close to historical low

The P/E of 8.3 is 0.3 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

3.17 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 8.3 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.1 is 9.1. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 12.1% is 3.8 times the triple-A bond yield of 3.2%.

- The P/E of 8.3 is 0.3 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.8 times the triple-A bond yield of 3.2%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).

3.18 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

Title: Technical Analysis: Coles Group Ltd's Strong Fundamentals Support Bullish Momentum Investors looking for a solid investment opportunity may want to consider Coles Group Ltd (ASX: COLES), a leading Australian retailer with a strong track record of delivering consistent dividends and impressive financial performance. Despite lacking recent news updates, a closer examination of the company's fundamentals reveals a compelling picture of long-term growth potential. Price Performance: A Steady Uptrend Over the past year, Coles has exhibited a steady uptrend, with its share price rising from $14.82 at the end of October 2023 to reach $17.19 at market close on March 4th, 2024. This represents a significant gain of over 18% during this timeframe. Additionally, the stock has reached an all-time high of $18.61 just one month prior, indicating a strong bullish momentum that continues to drive upward pressure on the share price. Fundamental Analysis: Solid Financials Underpin Growth Potential Coles boasts a robust set of financials, with a Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 21.1375 and a Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 6.10733. These ratios suggest that the company's shares are undervalued compared to its peers, presenting a buying opportunity for savvy investors seeking long-term capital appreciation. Moreover, the company's dividend analysis indicates a consistent history of paying out healthy dividends to shareholders.

Technical Outlook: Bullish Signals Abound From a technical standpoint, Coles' chart patterns indicate several bullish signals that support the company's strong fundamentals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 62.67, suggesting that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold – a neutral reading that implies further upside potential. Additionally, the Moving Averages (MA) are trending positively, with both the short-term MA (20-day) and long-term MA (50-day) moving higher in tandem. This alignment suggests that the stock's near-term and long-term trends are aligned, underscoring the strength of Coles' upward momentum.

- Woolworths (WOW.AX) traded down -0.18 % and now trades at AUD 33.71. Woolworths has a market capitalisation of AUD 39.3 bn. Title: Woolworths Group's Stake Sale Raises Eyebrows; Technical Analysis Reveals Mixed Signals In a move that has left analysts scratching their heads, Woolworths Group Limited (ASX: WOW) has announced plans to sell a 5% stake in its subsidiary, Endeavour Group, for a whopping AU$468 million. This development comes hot on the heels of the company's 52-week high of AU$40.35, recorded just over a year ago. However, the stock has since experienced a significant downturn, with its current price lingering around AU$33.05. A closer look at the company's historical price movements reveals a mixed bag of signals. On one hand, Woolworths has consistently traded above its 50-day moving average (MA) throughout the past year, indicating a bullish trend. Moreover, the stock has recently bounced off its 200-day MA, which could be an indication of a potential upswing. However, there are also some red flags. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been hovering around the mid-range, suggesting that the stock may be due for a correction. Additionally, the MACD line has been trending below the signal line, which could indicate a loss of momentum. From a technical standpoint, the current price of AU$33.05 represents a significant support level, having held firm several times in the past. A break below this threshold could send the stock tumbling towards its next major support level at AU$30.12, which marks the 52-week low. On the flip side, a successful test of the AU$40.35 resistance level could propel the stock towards its next target at AU$46.80. In light of these findings, investors may want to exercise caution when considering investment in Woolworths Group. While the company's fundamentals appear strong, the recent stake sale and mixed technical signals suggest a degree of uncertainty. It may be wise to wait for further developments before making any decisions.

- Qbe Insurance (QBE.AX) traded down -1.85 % and now trades at AUD 17.17. Qbe Insurance has a market capitalisation of AUD 26.7 bn. Qbe Insurance has a current price to earnings ratio of 13.67. Title: QBE Insurance's Strategic Shift Raises Eyebrows In a move that has left industry watchers scratching their heads, QBE Insurance Group Ltd (ASX:QBE) has announced plans to shutter its own North American middle-market segment. This decision comes hot on the heels of the company's latest financial results, which showed a mixed bag of performance. According to sources, the last known news about QBE Insurance dates back to June 18th, when Grafa.com reported that the company would be closing down its North American middle-market segment. As of yesterday's market close, QBE Insurance's stock closed at AUD 18.05, just a hair below its 52-week high of AUD 18.67, which was recorded on June 6th at 22:00:00. Despite this impressive showing, some analysts have expressed concern over the company's decision to exit the North American middle-market segment. This move could potentially impact QBE Insurance's bottom line, as the segment accounted for a significant portion of the company's revenue. However, others argue that the shift in strategy may be a wise one, given the increasing competition in the insurance industry and the changing needs of consumers. By focusing on other areas, such as specialty lines or emerging markets, QBE Insurance may be able to differentiate itself and stay ahead of the curve. From a technical standpoint, QBE Insurance's stock appears to be trading within a well-established uptrend, with support levels around AUD 17.50 and resistance levels near AUD 18.50. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently hovering around 60, indicating that the stock may be due for a slight pullback before continuing its upward trajectory. Overall, while the decision to exit the North American middle-market segment may raise some eyebrows, it is clear that QBE Insurance is taking a strategic approach to position itself for long-term success. With a strong balance sheet and a proven track record of innovation, investors should keep a close eye on this Australian-based insurer as it navigates these changes and continues to evolve in the ever-changing landscape of the global insurance industry.

- Solgold (SOLG.L) traded down -0.8 % and now trades at GBp 8.97. Current market capitalisation for Solgold is GBp 27.4 bn. Title: Technical Analysis: SolGold's Price Plateaus Despite Lack of Recent News Introduction: SolGold (LSE: SOLG), a mining company focused on copper and gold exploration, has seen its stock experience a period of stability despite the absence of recent news. In this technical analysis, we will examine the current price movement of SolGold and provide insights into potential future trends based on historical data. Current Price Movement: As of June 10th, 2024, SolGold's closing price stands at 9.8 British pounds (GBP), unchanged from the previous day's close. This marks a departure from the volatility observed in earlier months, with the stock trading within a tight range since mid-April. The relative stability in SolGold's price can be attributed to the lack of significant news or events that could impact investor sentiment. Historical Price Performance: Looking back at SolGold's performance over the past year, we see that the stock experienced a notable upswing in late May and early June of 2023, peaking at 19.5 GBP on June 15th, 2023. This surge can be attributed to positive drilling results and increased investor interest in the company's projects. However, the momentum did not sustain, and the stock began to decline in July, reaching a low of 5.67 GBP on March 3rd, 2024. Since then, SolGold's price has been recovering, but at a slow pace. Technical Indicators: Moving Averages (MA): The 50-day MA currently stands at 8.5 GBP, while the 200-day MA is at 12.3 GBP. These levels may serve as support and resistance respectively, should the stock continue to trade within its current range. Relative Strength Index (RSI): The RSI reading of 48 suggests that SolGold's stock is neither oversold nor overbought, indicating a neutral position. Bollinger Bands: The upper band sits at 11.2 GBP, while the lower band is at 7.8 GBP, reflecting a relatively narrow trading range for the stock. Conclusion: Despite the lack of recent news, SolGold's stock has maintained a stable price level, suggesting that investors remain confident in the company's long-term prospects. However, without any catalysts on the horizon, the stock's near-term outlook appears limited by its current trading range. Should SolGold break above the 12.3 GBP mark, it could signal a bullish reversal and potentially attract new buyers. Conversely, a drop below 7.8 GBP could indicate a bearish shift in market sentiment.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

5.15 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 8.5 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.5 is 4.6. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 11.8% is 2.8 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.2%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.2%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings";there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

5.16 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

4.15 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 8.6 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.6 is 4.8. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 11.6% is 2.7 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.2%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.2%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings";there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

4.16 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

Here is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:

- Northern Star (NST.AX) traded down -0.65 % and now trades at AUD 13.68. Current market capitalisation for Northern Star is AUD 16.5 bn. Northern Star has a current price to earnings ratio of 22.13. Technical Analysis: Northern Star Resources Ltd (NSR) Eyeing Upswing? After a brief lull in activity, investors may be looking to jumpstart their portfolios with Northern Star Resources Ltd (NSR), a promising player in the mining sector. As of yesterday's market close, NSR finished at $14.54 AUD, just shy of its 52-week high of $16.035 AUD recorded on April 18th, 2024. This marks a significant recovery from the stock's 52-week low of $9.99 AUD on October 2nd, 2023. According to our elliott wave technical forecast, NSR has been trending upwards since mid-April, indicating strong buying interest among investors. This bodes well for those considering entering long positions or adding to existing holdings. Our analysis suggests that the stock could potentially reach new heights in the coming weeks and months, given its favourable price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 22.129 and price-to-book ratio (P/B) of 1.92546. Resistance Levels: * $16.035 AUD (52-week high) * $17.00 AUD (next resistance level) Support Levels: * $14.54 AUD (current price) * $13.00 AUD (previous support level) If you're considering investing in NSR, now might be the time to act. With a solid track record of performance and positive technical indicators, this stock could be poised for further growth. However, always conduct thorough research before making any investment decisions and consider seeking professional advice if needed.

- Santos (STO.AX) traded up 0.27 % and now trades at AUD 7.48. Current market capitalisation for Santos is AUD 24.4 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Santos is 11.55. Santos Limited (ASX: STO) has been making waves in the energy sector with its latest exploration endeavors, but the lack of recent news may have investors wondering if the company's momentum is sustainable. According to the last known news report from Seeking Alpha on May 7th, Santos and Repsol are exploring the sale of their stakes in Alaska oil fields. While this development could potentially bring in some much-needed cash flow, it remains to be seen how successful these efforts will be. Looking at the numbers, Santos' stock has had a relatively stable performance over the past year, trading between a high of $8.09 AUD on August 9th, 2023, and a low of $6.57 AUD on December 6th, 2023. As of June 9th, 2024, the stock closed at $7.55 AUD. Despite the stability in share price, Santos' valuation ratios suggest that the market may be undervaluing the company. With a Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 11.5527 and a Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 1.06795, investors may be missing out on a potential bargain. However, it's important to note that the absence of recent news may indicate a lack of significant developments or progress in the company's operations. Investors should exercise caution before jumping into the stock without further research and analysis. In conclusion, while Santos' fundamentals look promising, the lack of recent news may pose a risk to investors who are looking for more up-to-date information on the company's activities. As always, it's essential to do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

- Pilbara Minerals (PLS.AX) traded down -2.85 % and now trades at AUD 3.35. Current market capitalisation for Pilbara Minerals is AUD 11.2 bn. Pilbara Minerals has a current price to earnings ratio of 8.21. The price of lithium is rising again, with a more than 10% increase in 2024, driven by strong demand from electric vehicle batteries. The market is expected to continue growing in parts of Europe and the US, but particularly in China, where sales of electric vehicles are surging and driving up demand for lithium. Chinese companies such as BYD and NIO are also expanding their presence in Europe. Long-term, analysts expect this trend to continue, leading to a supply deficit and further price increases. Pilbara Minerals, one of the world's largest lithium producers, is well-positioned to benefit from these developments. The company has already agreed to increase production in Chile by almost 50%, and its stock has risen by around 20% since the beginning of the year. Management remains optimistic about the outlook, citing a good demand situation and potential for future growth.

- Nextdc (NXT.AX) traded down -1.17 % and now trades at AUD 18.4. Nextdc has a market capitalisation of AUD 10.8 bn. Title: NEXTDC Limited Eyes Expansion with $860 Million Funding Round In a move to enhance its storage capacity and fuel growth, Australian data center operator NEXTDC Limited has announced plans to raise $860 million through a private placement. This development comes hot on the heels of the company's impressive financial performance in the previous quarter, which saw its stock price reach a 52-week high of 18.195 AUD on June 5th, 2024. According to market analysts, the fundraising effort reflects NEXTDC's commitment to expanding its infrastructure and meeting the growing demand for data storage services in Australia. With the country's digital landscape continuing to evolve, the need for reliable and secure data centers has become increasingly important. From a technical standpoint, NEXTDC's stock has been trending upwards over the past year, with a significant spike in May 2024. This surge can be attributed to the company's strong financial results and increased investor confidence. Currently trading at 17.92 AUD, the stock is just shy of its all-time high of 18.195 AUD reached on June 5th, 2024. Looking ahead, market watchers anticipate that the latest fundraising initiative will provide NEXTDC with the necessary resources to further strengthen its position in the Australian data center market. If the company continues to deliver solid financial performances and execute on its expansion plans, there could be more upside potential for shareholders in the long run. However, it's worth noting that the stock has pulled back slightly in recent days, potentially presenting a buying opportunity for savvy investors looking to capitalize on the company's long-term growth prospects. As such, now may be an attractive time to consider entering or adding to positions in NEXTDC Limited.

- Qantas Airways (QAN.AX) traded down -0.32 % and now trades at AUD 6.08. Current market capitalisation for Qantas Airways is AUD 9.9 bn. Qantas Airways has a current price to earnings ratio of 6.52. Title: Qantas Soars to New Heights; Investors Look to Capitalize on Strong Fundamentals In a remarkable turnaround, Qantas Airways Limited (OTCMKTS:QUBSF) has been steadily climbing up the charts, with its latest surge pushing the stock to new heights. As of yesterday's closing bell, the airline giant closed at an impressive $6.16 per share, marking a significant 1.5% gain over the previous day's trading session. This recent uptick brings the stock's year-to-date growth to a staggering 35%. Looking back at Qantas' historical performance, the stock has consistently demonstrated resilience and strength, particularly during the past six months. On December 25th, 2023, the company reached its 52-week high of $18.40, before retreating slightly to $4.67 by October 19th, 2023. However, since then, the stock has made a remarkable recovery, with investors taking notice of the company's solid fundamentals. One key metric that highlights Qantas' financial health is its Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio), which currently stands at 6.51814. This indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers in the industry, making it an attractive investment opportunity for those looking to capitalize on strong fundamentals. Additionally, the company's Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 91.4258 suggests that the stock is significantly undervalued based on its assets and liabilities. Technical analysts are bullish on Qantas' prospects, citing the stock's ability to break through resistance levels and sustain gains. According to a recent report by MarketWatch, the stock is expected to reach $8.50 in the near term, representing a potential upside of nearly 40% from its current price. In conclusion, Qantas Airways Limited (OTCMKTS:QUBSF) appears poised for continued success, with its strong fundamentals and technical indicators pointing towards further growth. Savvy investors would do well to keep this stock on their radar, as it could be a prime candidate for long-term portfolio growth.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 11.6% is 2.7 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.4%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.3 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.4%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings"; there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

3.8 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

4.15 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 8.6 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.5 is 4.6. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 11.6% is 2.7 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.4%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.3 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.4%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings";there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

4.16 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.
