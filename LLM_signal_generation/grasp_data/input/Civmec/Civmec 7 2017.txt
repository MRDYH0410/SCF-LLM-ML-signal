June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

5.14 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 10.6 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.7 is 7.1. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 9.4% is 2.2 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.4%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.1 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.4%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings";there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

5.15 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

Summary of the latest news for Civmec

Title: Civmec's Strong Order Book Boosts Investor Confidence Date: July 18, 2024 Perth-based engineering firm Civmec (ASX: CIV) has been making waves in the industry with its impressive order book and strong financial performance. Despite the lack of recent news, investors remain optimistic about the company's future prospects. A review of Civmec's historical stock prices reveals a steady upward trend over the past year. On October 31st, 2023, the company reached its 52-week high of $1.05 per share, before experiencing a slight correction in January 2024. However, the stock has since recovered and is currently trading at $0.93 per share, just shy of its pre-correction levels. Technical analysts attribute this resilience to Civmec's solid order book, which stands at an impressive $174 million. This represents a significant increase from the previous year and speaks to the company's growing reputation as a leading provider of engineering services. Furthermore, Civmec's Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.07807 and Price to Book (P/B) ratio of 1.12945 suggest that the market is undervaluing the company's potential for growth. These ratios indicate that investors can expect a high return on their investment relative to the company's earnings and book value. In light of these positive indicators, savvy investors may want to take advantage of the current price point and consider adding Civmec to their portfolios. With a strong order book and promising financials, the company appears well-positioned for continued success in the engineering sector.

Key Metrics and Ratios Pro Medicus' outstanding performance can also be gauged by examining some key metrics and ratios.

Overall, while there have been no significant changes in Treasury Wine Estates' share price or financial projections recently, the company's fundamentals remain strong.

5.15 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 9.4 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.6 is 5.5. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 10.7% is 2.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.3%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.3 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.3%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings";there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

- Ramsay Health Care (RHC.AX) traded up 0.45 % and now trades at AUD 47.4. Ramsay Health Care has a market capitalisation of AUD 10.8 bn. Ramsay Health Care has a current price to earnings ratio of 51.44. --- Ramsay Health Care Limited (ASX: RHC) has been quiet on the news front recently, with no updates since March 7th. However, investors may be interested in reviewing the company's historical performance and valuation metrics. According to data from feeds.feedburner.com, the last known news regarding RHC was on March 7th, where the company announced plans to consider a recommended cash offer to acquire Spire Healthcare M&A. This move could potentially expand RHC's portfolio and increase its market share in the healthcare industry. Looking at the company's stock performance, RHC closed at AUD 47 on the last trading day, representing a 52-week high of AUD 59.54 on July 31st, 2023, and a 52-week low of AUD 46.11 on June 26th, 2024. The current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 51.4352, while the price-to-book (P/B) ratio is 2.35349. Despite the lack of recent news, these valuation ratios suggest that RHC may still be an attractive investment opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the growing demand for healthcare services. With a strong track record of expansion and a solid balance sheet, RHC could be well-positioned to continue delivering value to shareholders in the long term. However, it's important to note that the healthcare sector can be subject to regulatory changes and competitive pressures, which could impact RHC's future performance. As such, investors should conduct thorough research and consult with their financial advisors before making any investment decisions.

- Insurance Australia (IAG.AX) traded up 1.41 % and now trades at AUD 7.05. Current market capitalisation for Insurance Australia is AUD 16.6 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Insurance Australia is 22.24. Title: Technical Analysis: Insurance Australia Group Ltd (IAG) Shows Mixed Signals Introduction: Insurance Australia Group Ltd (IAG), one of the leading insurance providers in Australia, has been experiencing mixed signals in its technical indicators, raising questions about the stock's future performance. As of today, July 11th, 2024, IAG closed at $6.96 AUD, down by 0.18% compared to its previous closing price. In this article, we will delve into the technical analysis of IAG's current and past prices to gain insights into its potential movements. Price Performance: Over the past six months, IAG has exhibited a bumpy ride, with fluctuations in both positive and negative directions. The stock reached its 52-week high of $7.33 AUD on June 27th, 2024, before retreating to its lowest point of $5.40 AUD on October 10th, 2023. However, since then, the stock has recovered somewhat, with its current price sitting at $6.96 AUD. This rollercoaster ride can be attributed to various factors such as changes in market sentiments, economic conditions, and industry trends. Moving Averages: When analyzing IAG's price performance, it's essential to consider moving averages, which provide a broader perspective on the stock's trend. Currently, the 50-day moving average stands at $6.73 AUD, while the 200-day moving average is $6.45 AUD. These averages suggest that the stock may be trading above both short-term and long-term levels, indicating a possible uptrend. However, the gap between the two moving averages indicates a growing divergence, which could signal a potential reversal in the near future. Price to Earnings Ratio and Price to Book Ratio: IAG's price to earnings ratio (P/E ratio) stands at 22.2423, suggesting that investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of the company's earnings. Similarly, the price to book ratio (P/B ratio) is 2.54939, indicating that the stock is overvalued based on its book value. While these ratios indicate a potentially expensive stock, they also reflect investor confidence in IAG's growth prospects. Conclusion: In conclusion, IAG's technical analysis suggests a mixed bag of signals, with both positive and negative indicators. Although the stock has experienced significant fluctuations in the past six months, it remains an attractive option for investors seeking exposure to the Australian insurance sector. However, given the current valuation multiples and the growing divergence between moving averages, investors should exercise caution when making investment decisions regarding IAG. It is crucial to monitor further developments and news updates to determine the best course of action for your portfolio.

Commonwealth Bank Of Australia has a current price to earnings ratio of 21.47. Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CMWAY) Stock Soars to 52-Week High Sydney, July 11th, 2024 - Shares of Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CMWAY) have been on an upward trajectory this year, with the stock recently reaching a 52-week high of $128.97 AUD. This impressive performance has outpaced many of its finance peers, according to a recent report by Zacks Investment Research. As of yesterday's closing bell, CMWAY closed at $128.54 AUD, representing a gain of over 21% so far this year. This remarkable growth can be attributed to the bank's strong financial fundamentals, including a healthy balance sheet and robust profitability. Technical Analysis: Bullish Trend Continues From a technical standpoint, the stock's recent surge has pushed it above its 52-week high, indicating a bullish trend that shows no signs of slowing down. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 68.67, suggesting that the stock may be slightly overbought but still has room for further growth. In addition, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is displaying a buy signal, with the MACD line crossing above the signal line. This indicates that the stock is likely to continue its upward momentum in the short term. Key Statistics: P/E Ratio & Price to Book Ratio At present, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of CMWAY stands at 21.4692, which is significantly higher than the industry average. This suggests that investors are willing to pay more for each dollar of the bank's earnings due to their confidence in its long-term growth prospects. Moreover, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 2.88036 indicates that the stock is trading at a premium compared to its book value. This could be a sign that investors believe the bank's assets are undervalued and have the potential to increase in value over time. Conclusion: Buy or Hold? While the stock's recent gains may make it seem expensive to some investors, the underlying fundamentals of Commonwealth Bank of Australia suggest that there is still room for growth. With a strong track record of profitability and a positive outlook, CMWAY may be worth considering for both buy-and-hold and active traders looking to capitalize on the bank's continued success.

In conclusion, based on the technical analysis, CAR Group Ltd appears to be a promising investment opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the growth potential of this ASX-listed company. However, we recommend conducting further research and consulting with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

5.15 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 9.3 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.6 is 5.5. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 10.8% is 2.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.4%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.2 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.4%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings";there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

5.16 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

5.15 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 9.1 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.6 is 5.3. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 11% is 2.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.4%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.2 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.4%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings";there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

5.16 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.
