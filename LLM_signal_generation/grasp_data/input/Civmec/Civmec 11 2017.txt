November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities."

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

SECTION 2 BULLISH SIGNALS

2.1 Price/Earnings of 11.7 < Construction and Engineering sector (of 45 stocks) avg of 15.2:

- The price-to-earnings ratio of 11.7 indicates undervaluation compared with sector average of 15.2 and market average of 13.0.

2.2 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 8.6% is more attractive compared with the Singapore average earning yield of 7.7%.

- The earnings yield of 8.6% is 3.1 times the 10-year bond yield of 2.8%.

(All figures in %)

Earnings Yield   8.6   
Singapore avg    7.7   
Dividend Yield   7.1   
Bond Yield       2.8   

Dividend Yield > Bond Yield of 2.79%:

The dividend yield of 7.08% is 2.54 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.79%. The times factor of 2.54 is above the benchmark factor of 0.67 times set by Benjamin Graham.

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   7.08   
Bond Yield       2.79   
Spread           4.29   

The Dividend Yield of 7.1% is better than the Index average of 5.0%

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 7.1%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the Straits Times Index of 5.0% is 140.8%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

2.6 Uptrend

Today's Volatility:

The 5% discount to 12-month high of SGD1.18 against the 62% premium to 12-month low of 68.93c suggests the stock continues to push for new highs.

Today its volatility (highest price minus lowest price/lowest price) of 1.8% was 1.1 times the average daily volatility of 1.7%, up from 0.9% on Thursday and 0.9% on Wednesday. A rise in the price on high volatility is a bullish signal.

Price/Moving Average Price of 1.29 and positive MACD:

- The Price/MAP 200 for Civmec is 1.29. Being higher than 1 is a bullish indicator. It is higher than the Price/MAP 200 for the Straits Times Index of 1.1, a second bullish indicator. The stock is trading above both its MAPs and the 50-day MAP of SGD1.06 is higher than the 200-day MAP of 86.63c, a third bullish indicator.

- The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator of 12-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of 1.1 minus the 26-day EMA of 1.09 is positive, suggesting a bullish signal. Both the 12-day EMA as well as the 26-day EMA are rising, another bullish signal.

- The price to 50-day EMAP ratio is 1.1, a bullish indicator. In the past 50 days this ratio has exceeded 1.1, 39 times suggesting further upside. The 50-day EMAP has increased to SGD1.06. An increase is another bullish indicator.

Past Quarter:

- In the last three months the stock has hit a new 52-week high ten times, pointing to a significant uptrend.

Relative Strength (6 months) 92 percentile:

- The stock has a 6-month relative strength of 92 in the Singapore market of 350 stocks and 2 ADRs which means it is beating 92% of the market.

- A price rise combined with a high relative strength is a bullish signal.

2.7 Other Bullish Signals

- Return on Equity of 13.7% versus sector average of 4.2% and market average of 6.3%.

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.3 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

- Return on Assets of 7.4% versus sector average of 2.3% and market average of 1.6%.

MCap/Total Assets:

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.8. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued.

- As per the Du Pont analysis, Return on Equity of 13.7% is better than sector average of 4.2%. This is computed as net profit margin of 6.9% times asset turnover [sales/assets] of 1.1 times leverage factor [total assets/shareholders' equity] of 1.8.

3.15 Satisfies six criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 11.7 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.6 is 18.1. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 8.6% is 3.1 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.8%.

- The P/E of 11.7 is 0.4 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 2.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.8%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).

-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).

3.16 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities." Link here.

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities." Link here.

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities." Link here.

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

- The P/E of 10.3 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.4 is 14.4. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 9.7% is 2.2 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.4%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.4%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).

-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).

-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities." Link here.

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

Bullish Turning Point

Price/Earnings of 11.7 close to historical low

The P/E of 11.7 is 0.4 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

SECTION 2 BULLISH SIGNALS

2.1 Price/Earnings of 11.7 < Construction and Engineering sector (of 45 stocks) avg of 15.2:

- The price-to-earnings ratio of 11.7 indicates undervaluation compared with sector average of 15.2 and market average of 13.0.

2.2 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 8.6% is more attractive compared with the Singapore average earning yield of 7.7%.

- The earnings yield of 8.6% is 3.1 times the 10-year bond yield of 2.8%.

(All figures in %)

Earnings Yield   8.6   
Singapore avg    7.7   
Dividend Yield   7.1   
Bond Yield       2.8   

Dividend Yield > Bond Yield of 2.79%:

The dividend yield of 7.08% is 2.54 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.79%. The times factor of 2.54 is above the benchmark factor of 0.67 times set by Benjamin Graham.

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   7.08   
Bond Yield       2.79   
Spread           4.29   

The Dividend Yield of 7.1% is better than the Index average of 5.0%

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 7.1%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the Straits Times Index of 5.0% is 140.8%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

2.6 Uptrend

Today's Volatility:

The 5% discount to 12-month high of SGD1.18 against the 62% premium to 12-month low of 68.93c suggests the stock continues to push for new highs.

Today its volatility (highest price minus lowest price/lowest price) of 1.8% was 1.1 times the average daily volatility of 1.7%, up from 0.9% on Thursday and 0.9% on Wednesday. A rise in the price on high volatility is a bullish signal.

Price/Moving Average Price of 1.29 and positive MACD:

- The Price/MAP 200 for Civmec is 1.29. Being higher than 1 is a bullish indicator. It is higher than the Price/MAP 200 for the Straits Times Index of 1.1, a second bullish indicator. The stock is trading above both its MAPs and the 50-day MAP of SGD1.06 is higher than the 200-day MAP of 86.63c, a third bullish indicator.

- The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator of 12-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of 1.1 minus the 26-day EMA of 1.09 is positive, suggesting a bullish signal. Both the 12-day EMA as well as the 26-day EMA are rising, another bullish signal.

- The price to 50-day EMAP ratio is 1.1, a bullish indicator. In the past 50 days this ratio has exceeded 1.1, 39 times suggesting further upside. The 50-day EMAP has increased to SGD1.06. An increase is another bullish indicator.

Past Quarter:

- In the last three months the stock has hit a new 52-week high ten times, pointing to a significant uptrend.

Relative Strength (6 months) 92 percentile:

- The stock has a 6-month relative strength of 92 in the Singapore market of 350 stocks and 2 ADRs which means it is beating 92% of the market.

- A price rise combined with a high relative strength is a bullish signal.

2.7 Other Bullish Signals

- Return on Equity of 13.7% versus sector average of 4.2% and market average of 6.3%.

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.3 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

- Return on Assets of 7.4% versus sector average of 2.3% and market average of 1.6%.

MCap/Total Assets:

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.8. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued.

- As per the Du Pont analysis, Return on Equity of 13.7% is better than sector average of 4.2%. This is computed as net profit margin of 6.9% times asset turnover [sales/assets] of 1.1 times leverage factor [total assets/shareholders' equity] of 1.8.

3.15 Satisfies six criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 11.7 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.6 is 18.1. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 8.6% is 3.1 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.8%.

- The P/E of 11.7 is 0.4 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 2.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.8%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).

-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).

3.16 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities."

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities." Link here.

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities."

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

The dividend yield of 6.8% is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.;

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities."

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

SECTION 3 BULLISH SIGNALS

3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 9.8% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 1.7%.

- The earnings yield of 9.8% is 2.2 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.5%.

(All figures in %)

Earnings Yield   9.8   
Australian avg   1.7   
Dividend Yield   6.8   
Bond Yield       4.5   

Dividend Yield > Bond Yield of 4.48%:

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   6.77   
Bond Yield       4.48

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities."

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

- The P/E of 10.2 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.4 is 14.2. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).

-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities."

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

SECTION 3 BULLISH SIGNALS

3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 9.9% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 1.7%.

- The earnings yield of 9.9% is 2.2 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.5%.

(All figures in %)

Earnings Yield   9.9   
Australian avg   1.7   
Dividend Yield   6.9

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities."

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

5.16 Satisfies six criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 10.1 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.4 is 13.7. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 9.9% is 2.2 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).

-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).

-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities.

The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities." Link here.

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

SECTION 3 BULLISH SIGNALS

3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 9.8% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 1.7%.

- The earnings yield of 9.8% is 2.1 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.6%.

(All figures in %)

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities." Link here.

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

5.16 Satisfies six criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 10.2 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.4 is 13.9. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 9.9% is 2.1 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).

-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).

-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

5.17 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.4 to 1.5.

- Reduction in total shares on issue.

- Improvement in asset turnover [growth in revenue of 24.4% exceeded growth in assets of 17.5%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Return on Assets improvement.

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Improvement in gross margin.

The company's shares have consistently traded above their 52-week low of $0.87 AUD, reaching a high of $1.05 AUD on October 31st, 2023. This marks a significant increase of 21% from its 52-week low.

Technical analysts attribute this growth to Civmec's solid order book, which stands at an impressive $174 million.

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities." Link here.

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

SECTION 3 BULLISH SIGNALS

3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities." Link here.

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

The stock is trading above both its MAPs and the 50-day MAP of $A1.22 is higher than the 200-day MAP of $A1.02, a third bullish indicator.

- The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator of 12-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of 1.3 minus the 26-day EMA of 1.29 is positive, suggesting a bullish signal. Both the 12-day EMA as well as the 26-day EMA are rising, another bullish signal.

- The P/E of 10.1 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.4 is 13.7. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 9.9% is 2.2 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities." Link here.

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities."

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities." Link here.

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities." Link here.

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

- The P/E of 9.8 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.3 is 12.9. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 10.2% is 2.2 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

Friday's Preview: Can Civmec rebound after being down? - Global Round Up - Stocks

{{20241122T000739.495+0000}}Friday's Preview: Can Civmec rebound after being down?SINGAPOREAN STOCK REPORT

Ahead of this morning's market opening, Civmec has shown some weakness in recent days. Civmec (SI:P9D), Singapore's largest Construction and Engineering company by market cap, fell 2.8% during its previous trading session to close at SGD1.05.

Bullish Turning Points

Price/Earnings of 10.9 close to historical low

The P/E of 10.9 is 0.3 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

Dividend Yield increases to 7.5%

Based on dividends of 7.93c per share for the trailing twelve months and the last price of SGD1.05 the dividend yield is 7.5%, a significant improvement from 7.3% on the previous day.

- The P/E of 10.9 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.4 is 15.8. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 9.2% is 3.2 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.9%.

- The P/E of 10.9 is 0.3 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 2.6 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.9%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).

2.18 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

Civmec (CVL: $A1.26) offers dividend yield of 7.1% - Australian Company News Bites - Stock Report

The dividend yield of 7.1% is 1.6 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.;

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities." Link here.

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

SECTION 3 BULLISH SIGNALS

3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 10.3% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 1.7%.

- The earnings yield of 10.3% is 2.3 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.6%.

(All figures in %)

Earnings Yield   10.3   
Australian avg   1.7    
Dividend Yield   7.1    
Bond Yield       4.6    

Dividend Yield > Bond Yield of 4.57%:

The dividend yield of 7.14% is 1.56 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.57%. The times factor of 1.56 is above the benchmark factor of 0.67 times set by Benjamin Graham.

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   7.14   
Bond Yield       4.57   
Spread           2.57   

The Dividend Yield of 7.1% is better than the Index average of 3.6%

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 7.1%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the All Ordinaries Index of 3.6% is 200.6%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

3.2 Other Bullish Signals

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.6 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

MCap/Total Assets:

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.7. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.5% in the last 3 years. This is better than the sector average of 5.4% and suggests a high margin of safety.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.6 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

2.17 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 11.2 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.5 is 16.9. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 8.9% is 3.1 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.9%.

- The P/E of 11.3 is 0.3 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 2.6 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.9%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).

2.18 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities." Link here.

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

- The P/E of 9.7 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.3 is 12.7. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 10.3% is 2.2 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.7%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.7%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

5.17 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.4 to 1.5.

- Reduction in total shares on issue.

- Improvement in asset turnover [growth in revenue of 24.4% exceeded growth in assets of 17.5%].

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities." Link here.

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

SECTION 3 BULLISH SIGNALS

3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

The Long-Term Bullish Case For Civmec - News Bites Asia - Singapore

{{20241120T020702.944+0000}}The Long-Term Bullish Case For CivmecSINGAPOREAN STOCK REPORT

Civmec (SI:P9D) has soared 43.8% Year To Date. There is uncertainty in the market and it is difficult to predict how economic conditions will be in 2025 and beyond as well as what the impact of those conditions may be on Civmec. However, there are several key reasons why some investors remain bullish on the long-term prospects for Civmec.

Below are some of those key reasons:

- The dividend yield of 7.27% is 2.46 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.96%. The times factor of 2.46 is above the benchmark factor of 0.67 times set by Benjamin Graham.

- Earnings yield of 8.8% is more attractive compared with the Singapore average earning yield of 7.8%.

- The price-to-earnings ratio of 11.4 indicates undervaluation compared with sector average of 15.0 and market average of 12.9.

- Return on Assets of 7.4% versus sector average of 2.3% and market average of 1.6%.

- Return on Equity of 13.7% versus sector average of 4.2% and market average of 6.3%.

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.3 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

- As per the Du Pont analysis, Return on Equity of 13.7% is better than sector average of 4.2%. This is computed as net profit margin of 6.9% times asset turnover [sales/assets] of 1.1 times leverage factor [total assets/shareholders' equity] of 1.8.

- LONG-TERM FUNDAMENTAL RANKING: 4 OUT OF 5 [5 is best]; It has a strong relative ROE of 13.7% and ROA of 7.4%. The company paid a dividend of 5.28c in the last twelve months. The dividend yield is high at 7.3%. Finally, its earnings growth in the past 12 months has been a comparatively high 10%.

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.8. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued.

Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 11.4 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.5 is 17.2. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 8.8% is 3 times the triple-A bond yield of 3%.

- The P/E of 11.4 is 0.4 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 2.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 3%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).

Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

Summary of the latest news for Civmec Singapore

Title: Civmec's Strong Order Book Boosts Investor Confidence Date: September 8, 2024 Perth-based engineering firm Civmec (ASX: CIV) has been making waves in the industry with its impressive order book and strong financial performance. Despite the lack of recent news, investors remain optimistic about the company's future prospects. A review of Civmec's historical stock prices reveals a steady upward trend over the past year. The company's shares have consistently traded above their 52-week low of $0.87 AUD, reaching a high of $1.05 AUD on October 31st, 2023. This marks a significant increase of 21% from its 52-week low. As of yesterday's closing price, the stock is currently trading at $0.93 AUD, representing a gain of 10% since the beginning of the year. Technical analysts attribute this growth to Civmec's solid order book, which stands at an impressive $174 million. This figure represents a substantial increase from the previous year's total of $120 million, highlighting the company's growing success in securing large-scale projects. Moreover, the company's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) of 8.51614 and price-to-book ratio (P/B Ratio) of 1.1907 suggest that investors are willing to pay a premium for Civmec's earning potential. While there have been no recent updates from the company, experts believe that Civmec's strong fundamentals will continue to drive its share price upwards. With a healthy balance sheet, a robust order book, and a proven track record of delivering successful projects, Civmec appears well-positioned for long-term growth. As such, savvy investors may want to take advantage of the current price and consider adding the company to their portfolios.

Here is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:

- Whitefield (WHFPB.AX) traded up 0.1 % and now trades at AUD 101. Current market capitalisation for Whitefield is AUD 667.9 mn. Current price/earnings ratio for Whitefield is 32.8.

- Macquarie Bank (MBLPA.AX) traded flat 0 % and now trades at AUD 100.73. Current market capitalisation for Macquarie Bank is AUD 670.4 mn. Current price/earnings ratio for Macquarie Bank is 25.02. Macquarie Bank Limited: Technical Analysis Despite the lack of recent news, Macquarie Bank Limited (MBL) has been making waves in the financial sector with its impressive performance over the past year. As of November 16th, 2024, the stock closed at 100.73 AUD, just shy of its 52-week high of 100.73 AUD reached on January 9th, 2024. This consistent upward trend suggests that investors have confidence in the company's ability to continue delivering strong results. Looking at the price to earnings ratio (P/E), MBL currently stands at 25.05, indicating that investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of earnings. This is slightly higher than the industry average, suggesting that the market expects Macquarie Bank to continue outperforming its peers. Additionally, the price to book ratio (P/B) of 3.41 indicates that the stock is trading at a slight premium to its book value. In terms of chart patterns, MACQR's recent movements have formed a bullish ascending triangle, which could be a sign of an impending breakout. If the stock manages to breach the upper boundary of the triangle, it could potentially reach new heights. However, it's important to note that this pattern is still developing, and there may be some volatility before a clear direction is established. Overall, while there haven't been any recent news updates on Macquarie Bank, the technical indicators suggest that the stock is in a strong uptrend and may continue to perform well in the near future. Investors looking for exposure to the financial sector may want to keep a close eye on MBL as it continues to make gains.

- Pantoro (PNR.AX) traded up 1.52 % and now trades at AUD 0.1. Current market capitalisation for Pantoro is AUD 664.8 mn. Pantoro Limited Remains Steady Despite Lack of Recent News Despite the absence of any recent news, Pantoro Limited (ASX: PNR) has maintained a steady pace, with its stock trading at $0.099 as of yesterday's market close. This figure represents a modest increase from the $0.088 recorded on October 6th, when the company entered into a gold price protection facility, according to the last available news report from HotCopper.com.au. A Technical Analysis of Pantoro's Asset Performance Looking back over the past year, Pantoro's stock has experienced a rollercoaster ride of ups and downs. The company's 52-week high of $0.13 was reached on October 30th, 2024, while the lowest point during the same period was $0.038 on February 27th, 2024. These fluctuations have resulted in a price to earnings ratio of -11.11 and a price to book ratio of 1.71774, indicating that investors may be anticipating a turnaround in the company's fortunes. In terms of short-term performance, Pantoro's stock has been trending upwards since mid-September, with a slight pullback towards the end of October. This could suggest that the company is gaining traction and poised for growth, although further confirmation is needed before making any definitive conclusions. Conclusion While there appears to be little in the way of recent news driving Pantoro's share price, the company's solid track record and promising long-term prospects make it an attractive option for investors seeking exposure to the mining sector. With a strong balance sheet and a focus on responsible mining practices, Pantoro is well-positioned to capitalize on improving market conditions and potentially deliver significant returns for patient investors.

- Waratah Minerals (WTM.AX) traded down -7.55 % and now trades at AUD 0.2. Waratah Minerals has a market capitalisation of AUD 675.1 mn. Waratah Minerals has a current price to earnings ratio of 1.42.

Civmec (CVL: $A1.28) offers dividend yield of 7.0%; -1c [0.8%] - Australian Company News Bites - Stock Report

{{20241119T065223.540+0000}}Civmec (CVL: $A1.28) offers dividend yield of 7.0%; -1c [0.8%]AUSTRALIAN END-OF-DAY STOCK REPORT

Civmec Limited (ASX:CVL) ranks 8 in the Top 20 by dividend yielding stocks in the Total Australian Market ex All Ordinaries Index of 1581 stocks.

Past 12 months DPS: 9.0c;

Last price: $A1.28; Dividend yield: 7.0%;

The dividend yield of 7.0% is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.7%.;

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities."

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

SECTION 3 BULLISH SIGNALS

3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 10.2% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 1.7%.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities." Link here.

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

2.17 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 11.4 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.5 is 17.2. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 8.8% is 3 times the triple-A bond yield of 3%.

- The P/E of 11.4 is 0.4 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 2.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 3%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).

2.18 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

Civmec (CVL: $A1.29) offers dividend yield of 7.0%; Vol Index 2.3 [1 is avg] - Australian Company News Bites - Stock Report

{{20241118T065219.624+0000}}Civmec (CVL: $A1.29) offers dividend yield of 7.0%; Vol Index 2.3 [1 is avg]AUSTRALIAN END-OF-DAY STOCK REPORT

Civmec Limited (ASX:CVL) ranks 11 in the Top 20 by dividend yielding stocks in the Total Australian Market ex All Ordinaries Index of 1581 stocks.

Past 12 months DPS: 9.0c;

Last price: $A1.29; Dividend yield: 7.0%;

The dividend yield of 7.0% is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.7%.;

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

Press Release article 2 of 6, 1151 words

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

Press Release article 2 of 6, 1151 words

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

Press Release article 2 of 6, 1151 words

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

- The P/E of 9.9 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.3 is 13.3. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 10.1% is 2.1 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.7%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.7%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

- The P/E of 12 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.6 is 18.9. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 8.4% is 2.9 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.9%.

- The P/E of 12 is 0.4 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.9%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

Summary of the latest news for Civmec Singapore

Title: Civmec's Strong Order Book Boosts Investor Confidence Date: September 8, 2024 Perth-based engineering firm Civmec (ASX: CIV) has been making waves in the industry with its impressive order book and strong financial performance. Despite the lack of recent news, investors remain optimistic about the company's future prospects. A review of Civmec's historical stock prices reveals a steady upward trend over the past year. The company's shares have consistently traded above their 52-week low of $0.87 AUD, reaching a high of $1.05 AUD on October 31st, 2023. This marks a significant increase of 21% from its 52-week low. As of yesterday's closing price, the stock is currently trading at $0.93 AUD, representing a gain of 10% since the beginning of the year. Technical analysts attribute this growth to Civmec's solid order book, which stands at an impressive $174 million. This figure represents a substantial increase from the previous year's total of $120 million, highlighting the company's growing success in securing large-scale projects. Moreover, the company's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) of 8.51614 and price-to-book ratio (P/B Ratio) of 1.1907 suggest that investors are willing to pay a premium for Civmec's earning potential. While there have been no recent updates from the company, experts believe that Civmec's strong fundamentals will continue to drive its share price upwards. With a healthy balance sheet, a robust order book, and a proven track record of delivering successful projects, Civmec appears well-positioned for long-term growth. As such, savvy investors may want to take advantage of the current price and consider adding the company to their portfolios.

Here is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:

- Whitefield (WHFPB.AX) traded flat 0 % and now trades at AUD 101. Current market capitalisation for Whitefield is AUD 670.3 mn. Whitefield has a current price to earnings ratio of 32.86.

- Rpmglobal (RUL.AX) traded down -0.67 % and now trades at AUD 2.98. Current market capitalisation for Rpmglobal is AUD 655.6 mn. Rpmglobal has a current price to earnings ratio of 77.63. RPMGlobal Holdings Ltd: Technical Analysis Paints Bullish Picture Despite a lack of recent news, the technical picture for RPMGlobal Holdings Ltd (ASX: RPM) paints a bullish story for investors. According to data from sources such as Feeds.FeedBurner.com, the stock has been trending upwards over the past year, with a 52-week high of $3.09 AUD at September 29th, 22:00:00. This marks a significant increase from the 52-week low of $1.475 AUD at December 4th, 23:00:00. Looking at the numbers, RPM's price to earnings ratio stands at an impressive 77.76, indicating that investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of earnings. Additionally, the price to book ratio of 11.8189 suggests that the market values the company's assets at a significant premium. From a technical standpoint, the stock has been trading above its 200-day moving average, which is currently sitting at around $2.65 AUD. This indicates that the uptrend is still intact and could continue in the near future. Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 64.27, which is considered neutral but leaning slightly towards a buy signal. In conclusion, while there may be no recent news driving the stock's performance, the technical indicators suggest that RPMGlobal Holdings Ltd remains a strong buy candidate for investors looking for long-term growth potential. With a solid track record of performance and promising fundamentals, this ASX-listed company could be worth keeping an eye on in the coming months.

- Macquarie Bank (MBLPA.AX) traded flat 0 % and now trades at AUD 100.73. Current market capitalisation for Macquarie Bank is AUD 671.2 mn. Current price/earnings ratio for Macquarie Bank is 25.05. Macquarie Bank's Latest Financials Paint a Picture of Stability Investors looking for stability and consistency in their investments may find what they're looking for with Macquarie Bank (MBL), whose latest interim financial report paints a picture of a well-performing institution. According to the bank's most recent filings, MBL closed out the first half of fiscal year 2025 with a strong showing across key metrics. At the time of writing, the last known closing price for MBL stock stands at $100.73 AUD, representing a modest increase over the past five days. This upward trend has been driven by a number of factors, including the bank's solid financial performance and positive market sentiment. One key metric that investors will want to keep an eye on is the bank's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), which currently sits at 25.05. This indicates that for every dollar of earnings, investors are willing to pay approximately $25.05 for each share of MBL stock. While this may seem like a high valuation, it's important to note that the bank's consistent profitability and growth potential have likely contributed to this premium pricing. Another important metric to consider is the bank's price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), which stands at 3.41. This means that for every dollar of assets held by the bank, investors are willing to pay approximately $3.41 in the form of MBL stock. Again, this suggests that investors have confidence in the bank's ability to generate profits and grow its assets over time. Looking ahead, investors will be eagerly awaiting the bank's full-year results, which are expected to provide further insight into the bank's financial health and future prospects. With a strong track record of performance and a commitment to innovation and customer service, Macquarie Bank appears poised to continue delivering value to its shareholders in the months and years to come.

- Ooh!media (OML.AX) traded up 0.82 % and now trades at AUD 1.22. Ooh!media has a market capitalisation of AUD 658.9 mn. Ooh!media has a current price to earnings ratio of 18.82. Ooh!Media Limited: Technical Analysis Reveals Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Ooh!Media Limited (ASX: OML) may be interested in the mixed signals emanating from the stock's technical indicators. Despite lacking recent news, the company's historical data provides valuable clues about its future trajectory. Recent Performance: A Tale of Two Halves Ooh!Media's last known news dates back to June 25th, with a partnership announcement that failed to excite investors. Since then, the stock has traded within a narrow range, with little movement above or below the $1.20 mark. This stability can be attributed to the company's strong fundamentals, but it also suggests a lack of momentum in either direction. Past Highs and Lows: A Story of Resilience Despite the recent lull in activity, Ooh!Media has shown remarkable resilience over the past year. In February, the stock reached an impressive 52-week high of $1.8675, before retreating slightly to $1.195 at the time of writing. This fluctuation highlights the volatility that investors can expect when dealing with this asset. Price-to-Earnings Ratio: A Premium Valuation? With a P/E ratio of 18.38, Ooh!Media trades at a premium valuation compared to its peers. While this could indicate confidence in the company's growth prospects, it also means that investors must be prepared for potentially lower returns than they might find elsewhere. Price-to-Book Ratio: Undervalued or Overvalued? At a P/B ratio of 0.883198, Ooh!Media appears undervalued based on its book value. However, this metric alone cannot determine whether the stock is a good buy or sell. Other factors, such as revenue growth and profitability, must be considered before making any investment decisions. Technical Outlook: Bullish or Bearish? From a technical standpoint, Ooh!Media's chart pattern suggests a bullish outlook. The stock has formed a symmetrical triangle, which often precedes a breakout move. If the price breaks above the upper boundary of the triangle, it could target the $1.40-$1.50 region. Conversely, a breakdown below the lower boundary could lead to a test of support around $1.10. Conclusion While Ooh!Media's recent news drought may deter some investors, the company's solid fundamentals and technical indicators suggest a more nuanced picture. With a premium valuation and potential for breakout moves, Ooh!Media remains an attractive option for risk-tolerant investors seeking long-term growth opportunities. However, those looking for short-term gains may need to wait until fresh news emerges to make a decision.

- Bravura (BVS.AX) traded down -1.31 % and now trades at AUD 1.57. Bravura has a market capitalisation of AUD 677 mn. Bravura has a current price to earnings ratio of 75. Bravura Solutions Ltd. (BVSFF): Technical Analysis and Outlook Investors looking for a strong performer in the technology sector may want to take a closer look at Bravura Solutions Ltd. (BVSFF), which has been steadily climbing over the past year. As of October 29th, the stock closed at 1.475 AUD, just shy of its 52-week high of 1.575 AUD reached on October 7th. This marks a significant increase from its 52-week low of 0.69 AUD on November 1st, 2023. One key metric that stands out for Bravura is its Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 74, indicating that investors are paying a premium for each dollar of earnings. Additionally, the stock's Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 4.96371 suggests that investors are willing to pay more for each dollar of book value. These ratios suggest that investors have confidence in the company's ability to continue growing its earnings and maintaining its financial health. Looking back at the company's historical performance, we can see that Bravura has consistently delivered strong EBITDA, as highlighted in an earlier earnings call transcript from feeds.feedburner.com on August 14th, 2024. This strength in EBITDA has likely contributed to the company's increasing share price over time. From a technical standpoint, Bravura's current trading range appears to be between 1.40 and 1.60 AUD, with resistance at the latter level and support at the former. If the stock can break above this range, it could potentially target higher levels such as 1.70 and 1.80 AUD. On the other hand, if the stock were to fall below 1.40 AUD, it could encounter support around 1.30 AUD. Overall, Bravura Solutions Ltd. (BVSFF) appears to be a strong performer in the technology sector, with a history of delivering solid EBITDA and a bullish technical outlook. Investors considering adding the stock to their portfolios should keep an eye on upcoming news and developments to determine if now is the right time to buy in.

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

SECTION 3 BULLISH SIGNALS

3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 9.7% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 1.7%.

- The earnings yield of 9.7% is 2.1 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.6%.

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   6.72

Spread           2.1    

The Dividend Yield of 6.7% is better than the Index average of 3.4%

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 6.7%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the All Ordinaries Index of 3.4% is 197.6%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

Civmec- 8 Reasons Investors Remain Bullish (and 2 Reasons Why Bearish) - News Bites Asia - Singapore

{{20241113T040654.452+0000}}Civmec- 8 Reasons Investors Remain Bullish (and 2 Reasons Why Bearish)SINGAPOREAN STOCK REPORT

Civmec (SI:P9D) has soared 51.7% Year To Date. There is uncertainty in the market and it is difficult to predict how economic conditions will be in 2025 and beyond as well as what the impact of those conditions may be on Civmec. However, there are several key reasons why some investors remain bullish on the long-term prospects for Civmec.

Below are some of those key reasons:

- The dividend yield of 4.21% is 1.49 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.82%. The times factor of 1.49 is above the benchmark factor of 0.67 times set by Benjamin Graham.

- The price-to-earnings ratio of 12 indicates undervaluation compared with sector average of 14.8.

- Return on Assets of 7.4% versus sector average of 2.3% and market average of 1.6%.

- Return on Equity of 13.7% versus sector average of 4.2% and market average of 6.3%.

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.3 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

- As per the Du Pont analysis, Return on Equity of 13.7% is better than sector average of 4.2%. This is computed as net profit margin of 6.9% times asset turnover [sales/assets] of 1.1 times leverage factor [total assets/shareholders' equity] of 1.8.

- LONG-TERM FUNDAMENTAL RANKING: 4 OUT OF 5 [5 is best]; It has a strong relative ROE of 13.7% and ROA of 7.4%. Finally, its earnings growth in the past 12 months has been a comparatively high 10%.

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.9. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued.

However, there are also some reasons investors may remain bearish in the long-term including the following:

- Return on Capital Employed of 14.3% versus sector average of 22.5%.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.1% in the last 3 years. This is lower than the sector average of 9.9% and suggests a low margin of safety.

2.17 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 11.6 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.6 is 18.0. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 8.6% is 3 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.8%.

- The P/E of 11.6 is 0.4 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.8%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).

2.18 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

Summary of the latest news for Civmec Singapore

Title: Civmec's Strong Order Book Boosts Investor Confidence Date: September 8, 2024 Perth-based engineering firm Civmec (ASX: CIV) has been making waves in the industry with its impressive order book and strong financial performance. Despite the lack of recent news, investors remain optimistic about the company's future prospects. A review of Civmec's historical stock prices reveals a steady upward trend over the past year. The company's shares have consistently traded above their 52-week low of $0.87 AUD, reaching a high of $1.05 AUD on October 31st, 2023. This marks a significant increase of 21% from its 52-week low. As of yesterday's closing price, the stock is currently trading at $0.93 AUD, representing a gain of 10% since the beginning of the year. Technical analysts attribute this growth to Civmec's solid order book, which stands at an impressive $174 million. This figure represents a substantial increase from the previous year's total of $120 million, highlighting the company's growing success in securing large-scale projects. Moreover, the company's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) of 8.51614 and price-to-book ratio (P/B Ratio) of 1.1907 suggest that investors are willing to pay a premium for Civmec's earning potential. While there have been no recent updates from the company, experts believe that Civmec's strong fundamentals will continue to drive its share price upwards. With a healthy balance sheet, a robust order book, and a proven track record of delivering successful projects, Civmec appears well-positioned for long-term growth. As such, savvy investors may want to take advantage of the current price and consider adding the company to their portfolios.

Here is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:

- Whitefield (WHFPB.AX) traded flat 0 % and now trades at AUD 101. Current market capitalisation for Whitefield is AUD 670.3 mn. Whitefield has a current price to earnings ratio of 32.86.

- Rpmglobal (RUL.AX) traded down -0.67 % and now trades at AUD 2.98. Current market capitalisation for Rpmglobal is AUD 655.6 mn. Rpmglobal has a current price to earnings ratio of 77.63. RPMGlobal Holdings Ltd: Technical Analysis Paints Bullish Picture Despite a lack of recent news, the technical picture for RPMGlobal Holdings Ltd (ASX: RPM) paints a bullish story for investors. According to data from sources such as Feeds.FeedBurner.com, the stock has been trending upwards over the past year, with a 52-week high of $3.09 AUD at September 29th, 22:00:00. This marks a significant increase from the 52-week low of $1.475 AUD at December 4th, 23:00:00. Looking at the numbers, RPM's price to earnings ratio stands at an impressive 77.76, indicating that investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of earnings. Additionally, the price to book ratio of 11.8189 suggests that the market values the company's assets at a significant premium. From a technical standpoint, the stock has been trading above its 200-day moving average, which is currently sitting at around $2.65 AUD. This indicates that the uptrend is still intact and could continue in the near future. Furthermore, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently at 64.27, which is considered neutral but leaning slightly towards a buy signal. In conclusion, while there may be no recent news driving the stock's performance, the technical indicators suggest that RPMGlobal Holdings Ltd remains a strong buy candidate for investors looking for long-term growth potential. With a solid track record of performance and promising fundamentals, this ASX-listed company could be worth keeping an eye on in the coming months.

- Macquarie Bank (MBLPA.AX) traded flat 0 % and now trades at AUD 100.73. Current market capitalisation for Macquarie Bank is AUD 671.2 mn. Current price/earnings ratio for Macquarie Bank is 25.05. Macquarie Bank's Latest Financials Paint a Picture of Stability Investors looking for stability and consistency in their investments may find what they're looking for with Macquarie Bank (MBL), whose latest interim financial report paints a picture of a well-performing institution. According to the bank's most recent filings, MBL closed out the first half of fiscal year 2025 with a strong showing across key metrics. At the time of writing, the last known closing price for MBL stock stands at $100.73 AUD, representing a modest increase over the past five days. This upward trend has been driven by a number of factors, including the bank's solid financial performance and positive market sentiment. One key metric that investors will want to keep an eye on is the bank's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), which currently sits at 25.05. This indicates that for every dollar of earnings, investors are willing to pay approximately $25.05 for each share of MBL stock. While this may seem like a high valuation, it's important to note that the bank's consistent profitability and growth potential have likely contributed to this premium pricing. Another important metric to consider is the bank's price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), which stands at 3.41. This means that for every dollar of assets held by the bank, investors are willing to pay approximately $3.41 in the form of MBL stock. Again, this suggests that investors have confidence in the bank's ability to generate profits and grow its assets over time. Looking ahead, investors will be eagerly awaiting the bank's full-year results, which are expected to provide further insight into the bank's financial health and future prospects. With a strong track record of performance and a commitment to innovation and customer service, Macquarie Bank appears poised to continue delivering value to its shareholders in the months and years to come.

- Ooh!media (OML.AX) traded up 0.82 % and now trades at AUD 1.22. Ooh!media has a market capitalisation of AUD 658.9 mn. Ooh!media has a current price to earnings ratio of 18.82. Ooh!Media Limited: Technical Analysis Reveals Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Ooh!Media Limited (ASX: OML) may be interested in the mixed signals emanating from the stock's technical indicators. Despite lacking recent news, the company's historical data provides valuable clues about its future trajectory. Recent Performance: A Tale of Two Halves Ooh!Media's last known news dates back to June 25th, with a partnership announcement that failed to excite investors. Since then, the stock has traded within a narrow range, with little movement above or below the $1.20 mark. This stability can be attributed to the company's strong fundamentals, but it also suggests a lack of momentum in either direction. Past Highs and Lows: A Story of Resilience Despite the recent lull in activity, Ooh!Media has shown remarkable resilience over the past year. In February, the stock reached an impressive 52-week high of $1.8675, before retreating slightly to $1.195 at the time of writing. This fluctuation highlights the volatility that investors can expect when dealing with this asset. Price-to-Earnings Ratio: A Premium Valuation? With a P/E ratio of 18.38, Ooh!Media trades at a premium valuation compared to its peers. While this could indicate confidence in the company's growth prospects, it also means that investors must be prepared for potentially lower returns than they might find elsewhere. Price-to-Book Ratio: Undervalued or Overvalued? At a P/B ratio of 0.883198, Ooh!Media appears undervalued based on its book value. However, this metric alone cannot determine whether the stock is a good buy or sell. Other factors, such as revenue growth and profitability, must be considered before making any investment decisions. Technical Outlook: Bullish or Bearish? From a technical standpoint, Ooh!Media's chart pattern suggests a bullish outlook. The stock has formed a symmetrical triangle, which often precedes a breakout move. If the price breaks above the upper boundary of the triangle, it could target the $1.40-$1.50 region. Conversely, a breakdown below the lower boundary could lead to a test of support around $1.10. Conclusion While Ooh!Media's recent news drought may deter some investors, the company's solid fundamentals and technical indicators suggest a more nuanced picture. With a premium valuation and potential for breakout moves, Ooh!Media remains an attractive option for risk-tolerant investors seeking long-term growth opportunities. However, those looking for short-term gains may need to wait until fresh news emerges to make a decision.

- Bravura (BVS.AX) traded down -1.31 % and now trades at AUD 1.57. Bravura has a market capitalisation of AUD 677 mn. Bravura has a current price to earnings ratio of 75. Bravura Solutions Ltd. (BVSFF): Technical Analysis and Outlook Investors looking for a strong performer in the technology sector may want to take a closer look at Bravura Solutions Ltd. (BVSFF), which has been steadily climbing over the past year. As of October 29th, the stock closed at 1.475 AUD, just shy of its 52-week high of 1.575 AUD reached on October 7th. This marks a significant increase from its 52-week low of 0.69 AUD on November 1st, 2023. One key metric that stands out for Bravura is its Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 74, indicating that investors are paying a premium for each dollar of earnings. Additionally, the stock's Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 4.96371 suggests that investors are willing to pay more for each dollar of book value. These ratios suggest that investors have confidence in the company's ability to continue growing its earnings and maintaining its financial health. Looking back at the company's historical performance, we can see that Bravura has consistently delivered strong EBITDA, as highlighted in an earlier earnings call transcript from feeds.feedburner.com on August 14th, 2024. This strength in EBITDA has likely contributed to the company's increasing share price over time. From a technical standpoint, Bravura's current trading range appears to be between 1.40 and 1.60 AUD, with resistance at the latter level and support at the former. If the stock can break above this range, it could potentially target higher levels such as 1.70 and 1.80 AUD. On the other hand, if the stock were to fall below 1.40 AUD, it could encounter support around 1.30 AUD. Overall, Bravura Solutions Ltd. (BVSFF) appears to be a strong performer in the technology sector, with a history of delivering solid EBITDA and a bullish technical outlook. Investors considering adding the stock to their portfolios should keep an eye on upcoming news and developments to determine if now is the right time to buy in.

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

SECTION 3 BULLISH SIGNALS

3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 9.7% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 1.7%.

- The earnings yield of 9.7% is 2.1 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.6%.

(All figures in %)

Earnings Yield   9.7   
Australian avg   1.7   
Dividend Yield   6.7   
Bond Yield       4.6   

Dividend Yield > Bond Yield of 4.62%:

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   6.72   
Bond Yield       4.62   
Spread           2.1    

The Dividend Yield of 6.7% is better than the Index average of 3.4%

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 6.7%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the All Ordinaries Index of 3.4% is 197.6%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.6 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

MCap/Total Assets:

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.7. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.5% in the last 3 years. This is better than the sector average of 5.4% and suggests a high margin of safety.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

Civmec- 8 Reasons Investors Remain Bullish (and 2 Reasons Why Bearish) - News Bites Asia - Singapore

{{20241113T040654.452+0000}}Civmec- 8 Reasons Investors Remain Bullish (and 2 Reasons Why Bearish)SINGAPOREAN STOCK REPORT

Civmec (SI:P9D) has soared 51.7% Year To Date. There is uncertainty in the market and it is difficult to predict how economic conditions will be in 2025 and beyond as well as what the impact of those conditions may be on Civmec. However, there are several key reasons why some investors remain bullish on the long-term prospects for Civmec.

Below are some of those key reasons:

- The dividend yield of 4.21% is 1.49 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.82%. The times factor of 1.49 is above the benchmark factor of 0.67 times set by Benjamin Graham.

- The price-to-earnings ratio of 12 indicates undervaluation compared with sector average of 14.8.

- Return on Assets of 7.4% versus sector average of 2.3% and market average of 1.6%.

- Return on Equity of 13.7% versus sector average of 4.2% and market average of 6.3%.

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.3 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

- As per the Du Pont analysis, Return on Equity of 13.7% is better than sector average of 4.2%. This is computed as net profit margin of 6.9% times asset turnover [sales/assets] of 1.1 times leverage factor [total assets/shareholders' equity] of 1.8.

- LONG-TERM FUNDAMENTAL RANKING: 4 OUT OF 5 [5 is best]; It has a strong relative ROE of 13.7% and ROA of 7.4%. Finally, its earnings growth in the past 12 months has been a comparatively high 10%.

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.9. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued.

However, there are also some reasons investors may remain bearish in the long-term including the following:

- Return on Capital Employed of 14.3% versus sector average of 22.5%.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.1% in the last 3 years. This is lower than the sector average of 9.9% and suggests a low margin of safety.

2.17 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 11.6 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.6 is 18.0. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 8.6% is 3 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.8%.

- The P/E of 11.6 is 0.4 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.8%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).

2.18 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

- The P/E of 10.3 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.4 is 14.4. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 9.7% is 2.1 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

4.9 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.4 to 1.5.

- Reduction in total shares on issue.

- Improvement in asset turnover [growth in revenue of 24.4% exceeded growth in assets of 17.5%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Return on Assets improvement.

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Improvement in gross margin.

Press Release article 2 of 6, 1151 words

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

5.16 Satisfies four criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 10.3 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.4 is 14.4. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 9.7% is 2.1 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

5.17 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Return on Assets improvement.

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Improvement in gross margin.

- The P/E of 12 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.6 is 18.8. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 8.4% is 3 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.8%.

- The P/E of 12 is 0.4 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.8%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).

2.18 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

SECTION 3 BULLISH SIGNALS

3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 9.8% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 1.7%.

- The earnings yield of 9.8% is 2.1 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.6%.

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   6.77

Spread           2.18   

The Dividend Yield of 6.8% is better than the Index average of 3.2%

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 6.8%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the All Ordinaries Index of 3.2% is 209.0%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.6 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

MCap/Total Assets:

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.7. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.5% in the last 3 years. This is better than the sector average of 5.4% and suggests a high margin of safety.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

- The P/E of 10.2 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.4 is 14.2. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 9.8% is 2.1 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

- The P/E of 12 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.6 is 19.1. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 8.4% is 2.9 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.9%.

- The P/E of 12 is 0.4 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.9%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).

2.18 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

SECTION 2 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS

2.1 Uptrend

Price/Moving Average Price of 1.33 and positive MACD:

- The Price/MAP 200 for Civmec is 1.33. Being higher than 1 is a bullish indicator. It is higher than the Price/MAP 200 for the All Ordinaries Index of 1.04, a second bullish indicator. The stock is trading above both its MAPs and the 50-day MAP of $A1.19 is higher than the 200-day MAP of 99.71c, a third bullish indicator.

- The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator of 12-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of 1.33 minus the 26-day EMA of 1.28 is positive, suggesting a bullish signal.

- The price to 50-day EMAP ratio is 1.1, a bullish indicator. In the past 50 days this ratio has exceeded 1.1, 18 times suggesting further upside. The 50-day EMAP has increased to $A1.22. An increase is another bullish indicator.

Past Quarter:

- In the last three months the stock has hit a new 52-week high four times, pointing to an uptrend.

Relative Strength (6 months) 90 percentile:

- The stock has a 6-month relative strength of 90 in the Australian market of 1,369 stocks which means it is beating 90% of the market.

3.3 Satisfies four criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 10.2 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.4 is 14.2. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.7%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

3.4 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.4 to 1.5.

- Reduction in total shares on issue.

- Improvement in asset turnover [growth in revenue of 24.4% exceeded growth in assets of 17.5%].

- Return on Assets improvement.

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Improvement in gross margin.

October 21: Civmec announces dividend

Civmec today announced a final dividend of 3.50c per share, franked to 100%. The ex-dividend date is Monday, October 14, 2024 and the record date is Tuesday, October 15, 2024 and it is payable on Friday, October 25.

Press Release article 2 of 6, 1151 words

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 9.8% is 2.1 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.7%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.7%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

SECTION 3 BULLISH SIGNALS

3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 9.8% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 1.7%.

- The earnings yield of 9.8% is 2.1 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.7%.

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   6.77

Summary of the latest news for Civmec Singapore

Title: Civmec's Strong Order Book Boosts Investor Confidence Date: September 8, 2024 Perth-based engineering firm Civmec (ASX: CIV) has been making waves in the industry with its impressive order book and strong financial performance. Despite the lack of recent news, investors remain optimistic about the company's future prospects. A review of Civmec's historical stock prices reveals a steady upward trend over the past year. The company's shares have consistently traded above their 52-week low of $0.87 AUD, reaching a high of $1.05 AUD on October 31st, 2023. This marks a significant increase of 21% from its 52-week low. As of yesterday's closing price, the stock is currently trading at $0.93 AUD, representing a gain of 10% since the beginning of the year. Technical analysts attribute this growth to Civmec's solid order book, which stands at an impressive $174 million. This figure represents a substantial increase from the previous year's total of $120 million, highlighting the company's growing success in securing large-scale projects. Moreover, the company's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) of 8.51614 and price-to-book ratio (P/B Ratio) of 1.1907 suggest that investors are willing to pay a premium for Civmec's earning potential. While there have been no recent updates from the company, experts believe that Civmec's strong fundamentals will continue to drive its share price upwards. With a healthy balance sheet, a robust order book, and a proven track record of delivering successful projects, Civmec appears well-positioned for long-term growth. As such, savvy investors may want to take advantage of the current price and consider adding the company to their portfolios.

Here is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:

- Macquarie Bank (MBLPA.AX) traded flat 0 % and now trades at AUD 100.73. Macquarie Bank has a market capitalisation of AUD 671.4 mn. Current price/earnings ratio for Macquarie Bank is 25.05. Macquarie Bank's Latest Financials Paint a Picture of Stability Investors looking for stability and consistency in their investments may find what they're looking for with Macquarie Bank (MBL), whose latest interim financial report paints a picture of a well-performing institution. According to the bank's most recent filings, MBL closed out the first half of fiscal year 2025 with a strong showing across key metrics. At the time of writing, the last known closing price for MBL stock stands at $100.73 AUD, representing a modest increase over the past five days. This upward trend has been driven by a number of factors, including the bank's solid financial performance and positive market sentiment. One key metric that investors will want to keep an eye on is the bank's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), which currently sits at 25.05. This indicates that for every dollar of earnings, investors are willing to pay approximately $25.05 for each share of MBL stock. While this may seem like a high valuation, it's important to note that the bank's consistent profitability and growth potential have likely contributed to this premium pricing. Another important metric to consider is the bank's price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), which stands at 3.41. This means that for every dollar of assets held by the bank, investors are willing to pay approximately $3.41 in the form of MBL stock. Again, this suggests that investors have confidence in the bank's ability to generate profits and grow its assets over time. Looking ahead, investors will be eagerly awaiting the bank's full-year results, which are expected to provide further insight into the bank's financial health and future prospects. With a strong track record of performance and a commitment to innovation and customer service, Macquarie Bank appears poised to continue delivering value to its shareholders in the months and years to come.

- Paragon Care (PGC.AX) traded down -1.19 % and now trades at AUD 0.4. Paragon Care has a market capitalisation of AUD 687 mn. Paragon Care has a current price to earnings ratio of 46.11. Paragon Care Limited: Technical Analysis As of November 6th, 2024, there have been no recent news updates for Paragon Care Limited (PGC), with the last known news dating back to August 31st, 2024. Despite this lack of recent news, investors may still be interested in analyzing the company's technical performance based on its historical stock data. Looking at the company's closing price over the past year, we can see that PGC has experienced a mixed bag of performances. After reaching a 52-week high of $0.50 AUD on October 16th, 2024, the stock saw a significant drop to a 52-week low of $0.17 AUD on November 23rd, 2023. However, since then, the stock has recovered somewhat, trading at $0.415 AUD as of market close on November 6th, 2024. From a technical standpoint, PGC's current price of $0.415 AUD represents a discount of approximately 13% compared to its 52-week high. This could potentially make the stock an attractive buy opportunity for investors looking for a bargain. Additionally, the stock's relative strength index (RSI) currently stands at around 40, indicating that it may be oversold and due for a rebound. However, it's important to note that the absence of recent news and the company's relatively volatile stock performance over the past year may indicate a higher level of risk for potential investors. As such, any decision to invest in PGC should be made with caution and thorough research.

- Develop Global (DVP.AX) traded down -1.63 % and now trades at AUD 2.32. Develop Global has a market capitalisation of AUD 666.4 mn.

- Clinuvel (CUV.AX) traded up 0.88 % and now trades at AUD 13.6. Current market capitalisation for Clinuvel is AUD 685.3 mn. Clinuvel has a current price to earnings ratio of 19.2. Title: Technical Analysis: Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals' Shares Steady Despite Minor Monthly Losses Introduction: Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals (CLV) has been making waves in the pharmaceutical industry with its innovative drug delivery systems and treatments. However, despite some minor monthly losses, the company's shares have remained stable, indicating a strong underlying performance. In this article, we will delve into the technical analysis of CLV's stock performance and explore what might be driving its resilience. Price Performance: According to data from Boerse.de, the last known news about CLV dates back to October 19th, when the stock closed at $13.73 AUD per share. Although the price has experienced slight declines over the past month, it remains well above its 52-week low of $12.96 AUD, which was recorded on March 10th. The stock's 52-week high stands at $18.2 AUD, achieved on December 3rd, 2023. Key Ratios: Our analysis reveals that CLV's Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio currently stands at 20.24, while its Price to Book (P/B) ratio is 3.5. These ratios suggest that investors are willing to pay a premium for CLV's earnings and assets, reflecting their confidence in the company's long-term growth prospects. Technical Indicators: Looking at CLV's chart, we can see that the stock has been trading within a relatively narrow range over the past few months. This stability could indicate that buyers and sellers are equally matched, or that the market is anticipating a potential breakout. Our analysis suggests that the stock may be poised for an upswing, given its strong fundamentals and the lack of any major catalysts for downward pressure. Conclusion: While CLV's shares have experienced some minor losses in recent weeks, the company's solid financial performance and promising pipeline of drugs have kept investor sentiment buoyant. With a strong track record of delivering value to shareholders, Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals appears well-positioned for continued success in the long term. As such, our technical analysis suggests that now may be an attractive entry point for investors looking to capitalize on the company's future growth potential.

3.4 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.4 to 1.5.

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Return on Assets improvement.

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Improvement in gross margin.

Press Release article 1 of 6, 52 words

October 21: Civmec announces dividend

Civmec today announced a final dividend of 3.50c per share, franked to 100%. The ex-dividend date is Monday, October 14, 2024 and the record date is Tuesday, October 15, 2024 and it is payable on Friday, October 25.

Press Release article 2 of 6, 1151 words

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

Press Release article 2 of 6, 1151 words

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

4.8 Satisfies four criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 10.4 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.4 is 14.6. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 9.6% is 2.1 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

4.9 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.4 to 1.5.

- Reduction in total shares on issue.

- Improvement in asset turnover [growth in revenue of 24.4% exceeded growth in assets of 17.5%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Return on Assets improvement.

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Improvement in gross margin.

SECTION 2 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS

2.1 Uptrend

Price/Moving Average Price of 1.33 and positive MACD:

- The Price/MAP 200 for Civmec is 1.33. Being higher than 1 is a bullish indicator. It is higher than the Price/MAP 200 for the All Ordinaries Index of 1.04, a second bullish indicator. The stock is trading above both its MAPs and the 50-day MAP of $A1.19 is higher than the 200-day MAP of 99.71c, a third bullish indicator.

- The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator of 12-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of 1.33 minus the 26-day EMA of 1.28 is positive, suggesting a bullish signal.

- The price to 50-day EMAP ratio is 1.1, a bullish indicator. In the past 50 days this ratio has exceeded 1.1, 18 times suggesting further upside. The 50-day EMAP has increased to $A1.22. An increase is another bullish indicator.

Past Quarter:

- In the last three months the stock has hit a new 52-week high four times, pointing to an uptrend.

Relative Strength (6 months) 90 percentile:

- The stock has a 6-month relative strength of 90 in the Australian market of 1,369 stocks which means it is beating 90% of the market.

2.2 Other Bullish Signals

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.6 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

MCap/Total Assets:

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.7. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.5% in the last 3 years. This is better than the sector average of 5.4% and suggests a high margin of safety.

SECTION 3 ONGOING BULLISH PARAMETERS

3.1 Past two-years

- Civmec rose for a second consecutive year. In the previous year the shares rose 35.65c (63.5%).

3.2 Created Market Value [CMV] past 5 yrs of $A308.5 million

- Market Capitalization has increased by $A458.4 million from $A217.9 million to $A676.3 million in the last 5 years. This increase comprises cumulative retained earnings (RETE) of $A149.9 million and Created Market Value of $A308.5 million. The Created Market Value multiple, defined by the change in MCap for every AUD1 of retained earnings is exemplary at $A3.06.

3.3 Satisfies four criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 10.2 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.4 is 14.2. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 9.8% is 2.1 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.7%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.7%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

3.4 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.4 to 1.5.

- Reduction in total shares on issue.

- Improvement in asset turnover [growth in revenue of 24.4% exceeded growth in assets of 17.5%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Return on Assets improvement.

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Improvement in gross margin.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.7%.

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

Press Release article 2 of 6, 1151 words

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

SECTION 3 BULLISH SIGNALS

3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 9.8% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 1.7%.

- The earnings yield of 9.8% is 2.1 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.7%.

(All figures in %)

Earnings Yield   9.8   
Australian avg   1.7   
Dividend Yield   6.8   
Bond Yield       4.7   

Dividend Yield > Bond Yield of 4.66%:

The dividend yield of 6.77% is 1.45 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.66%. The times factor of 1.45 is above the benchmark factor of 0.67 times set by Benjamin Graham.

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   6.77   
Bond Yield       4.66   
Spread           2.11   

The Dividend Yield of 6.8% is better than the Index average of 3.3%

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 6.8%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the All Ordinaries Index of 3.3% is 207.0%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

3.2 Other Bullish Signals

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.6 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

MCap/Total Assets:

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.7. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.5% in the last 3 years. This is better than the sector average of 5.4% and suggests a high margin of safety.

Summary of the latest news for Civmec Singapore

Title: Civmec's Strong Order Book Boosts Investor Confidence Date: September 8, 2024 Perth-based engineering firm Civmec (ASX: CIV) has been making waves in the industry with its impressive order book and strong financial performance. Despite the lack of recent news, investors remain optimistic about the company's future prospects. A review of Civmec's historical stock prices reveals a steady upward trend over the past year. The company's shares have consistently traded above their 52-week low of $0.87 AUD, reaching a high of $1.05 AUD on October 31st, 2023. This marks a significant increase of 21% from its 52-week low. As of yesterday's closing price, the stock is currently trading at $0.93 AUD, representing a gain of 10% since the beginning of the year. Technical analysts attribute this growth to Civmec's solid order book, which stands at an impressive $174 million. This figure represents a substantial increase from the previous year's total of $120 million, highlighting the company's growing success in securing large-scale projects. Moreover, the company's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) of 8.51614 and price-to-book ratio (P/B Ratio) of 1.1907 suggest that investors are willing to pay a premium for Civmec's earning potential. While there have been no recent updates from the company, experts believe that Civmec's strong fundamentals will continue to drive its share price upwards. With a healthy balance sheet, a robust order book, and a proven track record of delivering successful projects, Civmec appears well-positioned for long-term growth. As such, savvy investors may want to take advantage of the current price and consider adding the company to their portfolios.

Here is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:

- Macquarie Bank (MBLPA.AX) traded flat 0 % and now trades at AUD 100.73. Macquarie Bank has a market capitalisation of AUD 671.4 mn. Current price/earnings ratio for Macquarie Bank is 25.05. Macquarie Bank's Latest Financials Paint a Picture of Stability Investors looking for stability and consistency in their investments may find what they're looking for with Macquarie Bank (MBL), whose latest interim financial report paints a picture of a well-performing institution. According to the bank's most recent filings, MBL closed out the first half of fiscal year 2025 with a strong showing across key metrics. At the time of writing, the last known closing price for MBL stock stands at $100.73 AUD, representing a modest increase over the past five days. This upward trend has been driven by a number of factors, including the bank's solid financial performance and positive market sentiment. One key metric that investors will want to keep an eye on is the bank's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), which currently sits at 25.05. This indicates that for every dollar of earnings, investors are willing to pay approximately $25.05 for each share of MBL stock. While this may seem like a high valuation, it's important to note that the bank's consistent profitability and growth potential have likely contributed to this premium pricing. Another important metric to consider is the bank's price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), which stands at 3.41. This means that for every dollar of assets held by the bank, investors are willing to pay approximately $3.41 in the form of MBL stock. Again, this suggests that investors have confidence in the bank's ability to generate profits and grow its assets over time. Looking ahead, investors will be eagerly awaiting the bank's full-year results, which are expected to provide further insight into the bank's financial health and future prospects. With a strong track record of performance and a commitment to innovation and customer service, Macquarie Bank appears poised to continue delivering value to its shareholders in the months and years to come.

- Paragon Care (PGC.AX) traded down -1.19 % and now trades at AUD 0.4. Paragon Care has a market capitalisation of AUD 687 mn. Paragon Care has a current price to earnings ratio of 46.11. Paragon Care Limited: Technical Analysis As of November 6th, 2024, there have been no recent news updates for Paragon Care Limited (PGC), with the last known news dating back to August 31st, 2024. Despite this lack of recent news, investors may still be interested in analyzing the company's technical performance based on its historical stock data. Looking at the company's closing price over the past year, we can see that PGC has experienced a mixed bag of performances. After reaching a 52-week high of $0.50 AUD on October 16th, 2024, the stock saw a significant drop to a 52-week low of $0.17 AUD on November 23rd, 2023. However, since then, the stock has recovered somewhat, trading at $0.415 AUD as of market close on November 6th, 2024. From a technical standpoint, PGC's current price of $0.415 AUD represents a discount of approximately 13% compared to its 52-week high. This could potentially make the stock an attractive buy opportunity for investors looking for a bargain. Additionally, the stock's relative strength index (RSI) currently stands at around 40, indicating that it may be oversold and due for a rebound. However, it's important to note that the absence of recent news and the company's relatively volatile stock performance over the past year may indicate a higher level of risk for potential investors. As such, any decision to invest in PGC should be made with caution and thorough research.

Title: Technical Analysis: Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals' Shares Steady Despite Minor Monthly Losses Introduction: Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals (CLV) has been making waves in the pharmaceutical industry with its innovative drug delivery systems and treatments. However, despite some minor monthly losses, the company's shares have remained stable, indicating a strong underlying performance. In this article, we will delve into the technical analysis of CLV's stock performance and explore what might be driving its resilience. Price Performance: According to data from Boerse.de, the last known news about CLV dates back to October 19th, when the stock closed at $13.73 AUD per share. Although the price has experienced slight declines over the past month, it remains well above its 52-week low of $12.96 AUD, which was recorded on March 10th. The stock's 52-week high stands at $18.2 AUD, achieved on December 3rd, 2023. Key Ratios: Our analysis reveals that CLV's Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio currently stands at 20.24, while its Price to Book (P/B) ratio is 3.5. These ratios suggest that investors are willing to pay a premium for CLV's earnings and assets, reflecting their confidence in the company's long-term growth prospects. Technical Indicators: Looking at CLV's chart, we can see that the stock has been trading within a relatively narrow range over the past few months. This stability could indicate that buyers and sellers are equally matched, or that the market is anticipating a potential breakout. Our analysis suggests that the stock may be poised for an upswing, given its strong fundamentals and the lack of any major catalysts for downward pressure. Conclusion: While CLV's shares have experienced some minor losses in recent weeks, the company's solid financial performance and promising pipeline of drugs have kept investor sentiment buoyant. With a strong track record of delivering value to shareholders, Clinuvel Pharmaceuticals appears well-positioned for continued success in the long term. As such, our technical analysis suggests that now may be an attractive entry point for investors looking to capitalize on the company's future growth potential.

Civmec Australia trades -0.36 percent lower on Wednesday 6th of November - Stockpulse

{{20241106T200237.095+0000}}Civmec Australia trades -0.36 percent lower on Wednesday 6th of NovemberNov 06, 2024

Civmec Australia (1CV0.F) traded down -0.36 % during a 24 hours period ending at 08:31 PM Central Europe on Wednesday 6th. One Civmec Australia stock can currently be bought for about AUD 1.35 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Civmec Australia stocks is 508.5 mn. Civmec Australia has a current market capitalization of AUD 574.9 mn and approximately AUD 79.6 k worth of Civmec Australia was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Civmec Australia has traded 16.6 % up. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at AUD 1.02. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at AUD 1.45 on 10/28/2024. 52 weeks low was at AUD 0.86 on 05/07/2024.

Here is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:

- Paragon Care (PGC.AX) traded down -1.19 % and now trades at AUD 0.4. Paragon Care has a market capitalisation of AUD 687 mn. Current price/earnings ratio for Paragon Care is 46.11. Paragon Care Limited: Technical Analysis As of November 6th, 2024, there have been no recent news updates for Paragon Care Limited (PGC), with the last known news dating back to August 31st, 2024. Despite this lack of recent news, investors may still be interested in analyzing the company's technical performance based on its historical stock data. Looking at the company's closing price over the past year, we can see that PGC has experienced a mixed bag of performances. After reaching a 52-week high of $0.50 AUD on October 16th, 2024, the stock saw a significant drop to a 52-week low of $0.17 AUD on November 23rd, 2023. However, since then, the stock has recovered somewhat, trading at $0.415 AUD as of market close on November 6th, 2024. From a technical standpoint, PGC's current price of $0.415 AUD represents a discount of approximately 13% compared to its 52-week high. This could potentially make the stock an attractive buy opportunity for investors looking for a bargain. Additionally, the stock's relative strength index (RSI) currently stands at around 40, indicating that it may be oversold and due for a rebound. However, it's important to note that the absence of recent news and the company's relatively volatile stock performance over the past year may indicate a higher level of risk for potential investors. As such, any decision to invest in PGC should be made with caution and thorough research.

- Predictive Discovery (PDI.AX) traded down -3.57 % and now trades at AUD 0.27. Predictive Discovery has a market capitalisation of AUD 658.3 mn.

- Star Entertainment (SGR.AX) traded up 7.14 % and now trades at AUD 0.22. Star Entertainment has a market capitalisation of AUD 688.5 mn.

- Macquarie Bank (MBLPA.AX) traded flat 0 % and now trades at AUD 100.73. Current market capitalisation for Macquarie Bank is AUD 671.4 mn. Macquarie Bank has a current price to earnings ratio of 25.05. Macquarie Bank's Latest Financials Paint a Picture of Stability Investors looking for stability and consistency in their investments may find what they're looking for with Macquarie Bank (MBL), whose latest interim financial report paints a picture of a well-performing institution. According to the bank's most recent filings, MBL closed out the first half of fiscal year 2025 with a strong showing across key metrics. At the time of writing, the last known closing price for MBL stock stands at $100.73 AUD, representing a modest increase over the past five days. This upward trend has been driven by a number of factors, including the bank's solid financial performance and positive market sentiment. One key metric that investors will want to keep an eye on is the bank's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), which currently sits at 25.05. This indicates that for every dollar of earnings, investors are willing to pay approximately $25.05 for each share of MBL stock. While this may seem like a high valuation, it's important to note that the bank's consistent profitability and growth potential have likely contributed to this premium pricing. Another important metric to consider is the bank's price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio), which stands at 3.41. This means that for every dollar of assets held by the bank, investors are willing to pay approximately $3.41 in the form of MBL stock. Again, this suggests that investors have confidence in the bank's ability to generate profits and grow its assets over time. Looking ahead, investors will be eagerly awaiting the bank's full-year results, which are expected to provide further insight into the bank's financial health and future prospects. With a strong track record of performance and a commitment to innovation and customer service, Macquarie Bank appears poised to continue delivering value to its shareholders in the months and years to come.

SECTION 2 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS

2.1 Uptrend

Price/Moving Average Price of 1.36 and positive MACD:

- The Price/MAP 200 for Civmec is 1.36. Being higher than 1 is a bullish indicator. It is higher than the Price/MAP 200 for the All Ordinaries Index of 1.04, a second bullish indicator. The stock is trading above both its MAPs and the 50-day MAP of $A1.19 is higher than the 200-day MAP of 99.53c, a third bullish indicator.

- The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator of 12-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of 1.33 minus the 26-day EMA of 1.28 is positive, suggesting a bullish signal. Both the 12-day EMA as well as the 26-day EMA are rising, another bullish signal.

- The price to 50-day EMAP ratio is 1.1, a bullish indicator. In the past 50 days this ratio has exceeded 1.1, 14 times suggesting further upside. The 50-day EMAP has increased to $A1.21. An increase is another bullish indicator.

Past Quarter:

- In the last three months the stock has hit a new 52-week high four times, pointing to an uptrend.

Relative Strength (6 months) 88 percentile:

- The stock has a 6-month relative strength of 88 in the Australian market of 1,353 stocks which means it is beating 88% of the market.

2.2 Other Bullish Signals

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.6 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

MCap/Total Assets:

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.8. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.5% in the last 3 years. This is better than the sector average of 5.4% and suggests a high margin of safety.

3.4 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.4 to 1.5.

Civmec today announced a final dividend of 3.50c per share, franked to 100%. The ex-dividend date is Monday, October 14, 2024 and the record date is Tuesday, October 15, 2024 and it is payable on Friday, October 25.

Press Release article 2 of 6, 1151 words

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

- The P/E of 10.4 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.4 is 14.6. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 9.6% is 2.1 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

The Long-Term Bullish Case For Civmec - News Bites Asia - Singapore

{{20241106T040726.755+0000}}The Long-Term Bullish Case For CivmecSINGAPOREAN STOCK REPORT

Civmec (SI:P9D) has soared 50.4% Year To Date. There is uncertainty in the market and it is difficult to predict how economic conditions will be in 2025 and beyond as well as what the impact of those conditions may be on Civmec. However, there are several key reasons why some investors remain bullish on the long-term prospects for Civmec.

Below are some of those key reasons:

- The dividend yield of 4.25% is 1.49 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.86%. The times factor of 1.49 is above the benchmark factor of 0.67 times set by Benjamin Graham.

- Earnings yield of 8.4% is more attractive compared with the Singapore average earning yield of 8.3%.

- The price-to-earnings ratio of 11.9 indicates undervaluation compared with sector average of 15.0.

- Return on Assets of 7.4% versus sector average of 2.3% and market average of 1.6%.

- Return on Equity of 13.7% versus sector average of 4.2% and market average of 6.3%.

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.3 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

- As per the Du Pont analysis, Return on Equity of 13.7% is better than sector average of 4.2%. This is computed as net profit margin of 6.9% times asset turnover [sales/assets] of 1.1 times leverage factor [total assets/shareholders' equity] of 1.8.

- LONG-TERM FUNDAMENTAL RANKING: 4 OUT OF 5 [5 is best]; It has a strong relative ROE of 13.7% and ROA of 7.4%. Finally, its earnings growth in the past 12 months has been a comparatively high 10%.

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.9. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued.

2019   1.8                

Low Debt to Equity (%) and Reducing

The debt to equity ratio of 15.9% is under a safe benchmark figure of 50%. Moreover, it has improved in the past four years.

Years      Debt to Equity (%)   
Jun 2023   15.86                
Jun 2022   22.79

Jun 2020   27.79                
Jun 2019   67.29                

Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 11.9 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.6 is 19.0. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 8.4% is 2.9 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.9%.

- The P/E of 11.9 is 0.4 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.9%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).

Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 8.3% is 2.9 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.9%.

- The P/E of 12 is 0.4 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.9%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).

2.19 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

SECTION 2 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS

2.1 Uptrend

Today's Volatility:

The 6% discount to 12-month high of $A1.45 against the 71% premium to 12-month low of 79.89c suggests the stock continues to push for new highs.

Price/Moving Average Price of 1.38 and positive MACD:

- The Price/MAP 200 for Civmec is 1.38. Being higher than 1 is a bullish indicator. It is higher than the Price/MAP 200 for the All Ordinaries Index of 1.03, a second bullish indicator. The stock is trading above both its MAPs and the 50-day MAP of $A1.18 is higher than the 200-day MAP of 99.33c, a third bullish indicator.

- The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator of 12-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of 1.33 minus the 26-day EMA of 1.27 is positive, suggesting a bullish signal. Both the 12-day EMA as well as the 26-day EMA are rising, another bullish signal.

- The price to 50-day EMAP ratio is 1.1, a bullish indicator. In the past 50 days this ratio has exceeded 1.1, seven times suggesting further upside. The 50-day EMAP has increased to $A1.21. An increase is another bullish indicator.

Past Month:

- Rises to Falls: In the past month the number of rises outnumbered falls 11:7 or 1.6:1.

Past Quarter:

- In the last three months the stock has hit a new 52-week high five times, pointing to an uptrend.

Relative Strength (6 months) 90 percentile:

- The stock has a 6-month relative strength of 90 in the Australian market of 1,322 stocks which means it is beating 90% of the market.

2.2 Other Bullish Signals

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.6 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

MCap/Total Assets:

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.8. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.5% in the last 3 years. This is better than the sector average of 5.4% and suggests a high margin of safety.

SECTION 3 ONGOING BULLISH PARAMETERS

3.1 Past two-years

- Civmec rose for a second consecutive year. In the previous year the shares rose 39.11c (74.2%).

3.2 Created Market Value [CMV] past 5 yrs of $A336.4 million

- Market Capitalization has increased by $A486.3 million from $A210.4 million to $A696.7 million in the last 5 years. This increase comprises cumulative retained earnings (RETE) of $A149.9 million and Created Market Value of $A336.4 million. The Created Market Value multiple, defined by the change in MCap for every AUD1 of retained earnings is exemplary at $A3.24.

3.3 Satisfies four criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 10.5 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.4 is 15.1. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 9.5% is 2.1 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

3.4 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.4 to 1.5.

- Reduction in total shares on issue.

- Improvement in asset turnover [growth in revenue of 24.4% exceeded growth in assets of 17.5%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Return on Assets improvement.

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Improvement in gross margin.

Civmec (CVL: $A1.37) offers dividend yield of 6.6%; -2c [1.4%] - Australian Company News Bites - Stock Report

{{20241105T071251.092+0000}}Civmec (CVL: $A1.37) offers dividend yield of 6.6%; -2c [1.4%]AUSTRALIAN END-OF-DAY STOCK REPORT

Civmec Limited (ASX:CVL) ranks 10 in the Top 20 by dividend yielding stocks in the Total Australian Market ex All Ordinaries Index of 1580 stocks.

Past 12 months DPS: 9.0c;

Last price: $A1.37; Dividend yield: 6.6%;

The dividend yield of 6.6% is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.;

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

Press Release article 2 of 6, 1151 words

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

Press Release article 1 of 6, 52 words

October 21: Civmec announces dividend

Civmec today announced a final dividend of 3.50c per share, franked to 100%. The ex-dividend date is Monday, October 14, 2024 and the record date is Tuesday, October 15, 2024 and it is payable on Friday, October 25.

Press Release article 2 of 6, 1151 words

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

- The P/E of 10.5 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.4 is 15.1. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 9.5% is 2.1 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

5.17 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

Civmec (CVL: $A1.39) offers dividend yield of 6.5%; +3c [2.2%] Vol Index 2.1 [1 is avg] - Australian Company News Bites - Stock Report

{{20241104T065209.642+0000}}Civmec (CVL: $A1.39) offers dividend yield of 6.5%; +3c [2.2%] Vol Index 2.1 [1 is avg]AUSTRALIAN END-OF-DAY STOCK REPORT

Civmec Limited (ASX:CVL) ranks 13 in the Top 20 by dividend yielding stocks in the Total Australian Market ex All Ordinaries Index of 1580 stocks.

Past 12 months DPS: 9.0c;

Last price: $A1.39; Dividend yield: 6.5%;

The dividend yield of 6.5% is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.;

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

SECTION 3 BULLISH SIGNALS

3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 9.3% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 1.7%.

- The earnings yield of 9.3% is 2.1 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.6%.

(All figures in %)

Earnings Yield   9.3   
Australian avg   1.7   
Dividend Yield   6.5

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

Press Release article 2 of 6, 1151 words

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

4.5 Uptrend

Today's Volatility:

The 4% discount to 12-month high of $A1.45 against the 74% premium to 12-month low of 79.89c suggests the stock continues to push for new highs.

Since the start of trading its volatility (highest price minus lowest price/lowest price) of 4.4% was 1.7 times the average daily volatility of 2.6%, up from 1.5% on Friday and 3.6% on Thursday. A rise in the price on high volatility is a bullish signal.

Price/Moving Average Price of 1.4 and positive MACD:

- The Price/MAP 200 for Civmec is 1.4. Being higher than 1 is a bullish indicator. It is higher than the Price/MAP 200 for the All Ordinaries Index of 1.04, a second bullish indicator. The stock is trading above both its MAPs and the 50-day MAP of $A1.18 is higher than the 200-day MAP of 99.12c, a third bullish indicator.

- The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator of 12-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of 1.32 minus the 26-day EMA of 1.27 is positive, suggesting a bullish signal. Both the 12-day EMA as well as the 26-day EMA are rising, another bullish signal.

- The price to 50-day EMAP ratio is 1.2, a bullish indicator. In the past 50 days this ratio has exceeded 1.2 just twice suggesting a resistance level.The 50-day EMAP has increased to $A1.20. An increase is another bullish indicator.

Past Month:

- Rises to Falls: In the past month the number of rises outnumbered falls 12:6 or 2:1.

Past Quarter:

In the last three months the stock has hit a new 52-week high five times, pointing to an uptrend.

Relative Strength (6 months) 90 percentile:

- The stock has a 6-month relative strength of 90 in the Australian market of 1,390 stocks which means it is beating 90% of the market.

- A price rise combined with a high relative strength is a bullish signal.

4.6 Other Bullish Signals

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.6 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

MCap/Total Assets:

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.8. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.5% in the last 3 years. This is better than the sector average of 5.4% and suggests a high margin of safety.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

SECTION 3 BULLISH SIGNALS

3.1 Price to Book of 1.4 < Capital Goods sector (of 65 stocks) average of 2.8:

- The Price to Book of 1.4 indicates undervaluation compared with sector average of 2.8 and 3.2 for the Australian Market.

3.2 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 9.4% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 1.7%.

- The earnings yield of 9.4% is 2.1 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.6%.

Australian avg   1.7   
Dividend Yield   6.5   
Bond Yield       4.6   

Dividend Yield > Bond Yield of 4.56%:

The dividend yield of 6.52% is 1.43 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.56%. The times factor of 1.43 is above the benchmark factor of 0.67 times set by Benjamin Graham.

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   6.52   
Bond Yield       4.56

The Dividend Yield of 6.5% is better than the Index average of 3.3%

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 6.5%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the All Ordinaries Index of 3.3% is 198.2%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

3.6 Uptrend

Today's Volatility:

The 5% discount to 12-month high of $A1.45 against the 73% premium to 12-month low of 79.89c suggests the stock continues to push for new highs.

Since the start of trading its volatility (highest price minus lowest price/lowest price) of 3.6% was 1.4 times the average daily volatility of 2.6%, up from 2.2% on Wednesday. Price/Moving Average Price of 1.4 and positive MACD:

- The Price/MAP 200 for Civmec is 1.4. Being higher than 1 is a bullish indicator. It is higher than the Price/MAP 200 for the All Ordinaries Index of 1.04, a second bullish indicator. The stock is trading above both its MAPs and the 50-day MAP of $A1.17 is higher than the 200-day MAP of 98.70c, a third bullish indicator.

- The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator of 12-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of 1.3 minus the 26-day EMA of 1.25 is positive, suggesting a bullish signal. Both the 12-day EMA as well as the 26-day EMA are rising, another bullish signal.

- The price to 50-day EMAP ratio is 1.2, a bullish indicator. In the past 50 days this ratio has exceeded 1.2 just twice suggesting a resistance level. The 50-day EMAP has increased to $A1.19. An increase is another bullish indicator.

Past Month:

- Rises to Falls: In the past month the number of rises outnumbered falls 13:5 or 2.6:1.

Past Quarter:

- In the last three months the stock has hit a new 52-week high five times, pointing to an uptrend.

Relative Strength (6 months) 89 percentile:

- The stock has a 6-month relative strength of 89 in the Australian market of 1,400 stocks which means it is beating 89% of the market.

3.7 Other Bullish Signals

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.6 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

MCap/Total Assets:

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.8. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.5% in the last 3 years. This is better than the sector average of 5.4% and suggests a high margin of safety.

- The P/E of 10.6 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.4 is 15.3. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 9.4% is 2.1 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.6%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

- Return on Assets improvement.

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Improvement in gross margin.

2.18 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 12 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.6 is 18.9. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 8.4% is 3 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.8%.

- The P/E of 12 is 0.4 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.8%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).

2.19 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.4 to 1.5.

Press Release article 2 of 6, 1151 words

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

- The P/E of 10.5 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.4 is 14.9. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 9.6% is 2.1 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

Summary of the latest news for Civmec Singapore

Title: Civmec's Strong Order Book Boosts Investor Confidence Date: September 8, 2024 Perth-based engineering firm Civmec (ASX: CIV) has been making waves in the industry with its impressive order book and strong financial performance. Despite the lack of recent news, investors remain optimistic about the company's future prospects. A review of Civmec's historical stock prices reveals a steady upward trend over the past year. The company's shares have consistently traded above their 52-week low of $0.87 AUD, reaching a high of $1.05 AUD on October 31st, 2023. This marks a significant increase of 21% from its 52-week low. As of yesterday's closing price, the stock is currently trading at $0.93 AUD, representing a gain of 10% since the beginning of the year. Technical analysts attribute this growth to Civmec's solid order book, which stands at an impressive $174 million. This figure represents a substantial increase from the previous year's total of $120 million, highlighting the company's growing success in securing large-scale projects. Moreover, the company's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) of 8.51614 and price-to-book ratio (P/B Ratio) of 1.1907 suggest that investors are willing to pay a premium for Civmec's earning potential. While there have been no recent updates from the company, experts believe that Civmec's strong fundamentals will continue to drive its share price upwards. With a healthy balance sheet, a robust order book, and a proven track record of delivering successful projects, Civmec appears well-positioned for long-term growth. As such, savvy investors may want to take advantage of the current price and consider adding the company to their portfolios.

Here is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:

- Strike Energy (STX.AX) traded up 7.5 % and now trades at AUD 0.21. Current market capitalisation for Strike Energy is AUD 624.7 mn. Current price/earnings ratio for Strike Energy is 72.67. Strike Energy Limited: Technical Analysis Paints Promising Picture Investors looking for a potential gem may want to take a closer look at Strike Energy Limited (ASX: STK), whose latest annual report highlights a strong financial position and promising growth prospects. As of October 30th, 2024, the stock closed at 0.195 AUD, representing a significant discount compared to its 52-week high of 0.505 AUD reached on January 7th, 2024. This presents an attractive entry point for investors seeking a value play. A review of the company's historical pricing data reveals a pattern of fluctuations around key milestones, such as project updates and announcements. For instance, the stock experienced a surge in value following the release of the company's annual report on September 29th, 2024, which showcased a healthy balance sheet with a low debt-to-equity ratio of 0.35. This suggests that the company has been managing its finances effectively and is well-positioned to capitalize on future opportunities. From a technical standpoint, Strike Energy's price chart displays a bullish trend, with the stock trading above its short-term moving averages (MA) and long-term MAs. The relative strength index (RSI) currently stands at 44.67, indicating a neutral position, but with room for improvement given the oversold conditions in previous periods. A breakout above the psychological level of 0.25 could trigger a rally towards the next resistance level at 0.35, potentially offering a 40% upside potential. Furthermore, the company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 66.67 and price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.2983 suggest that the market has yet to fully recognize the company's growth potential. This undervaluation can be attributed to the sector-wide downturn and general investor sentiment, rather than any fundamental issues with the company itself. In conclusion, Strike Energy Limited appears to offer a compelling risk-reward profile for investors willing to take a longer-term perspective. While near-term volatility cannot be ruled out, the company's solid financials, promising growth prospects, and undervalued status make it an attractive addition to any watchlist or portfolio.

- Lotus (LOT.AX) traded flat 0 % and now trades at AUD 0.26. Lotus has a market capitalisation of AUD 627.5 mn. Lotus Resources Ltd.: Technical Analysis Investors may be eyeing Lotus Resources Ltd. (OTCMKTS: LTUSF) with interest, given the company's recent activity and promising financials. As of yesterday's closing bell, the stock closed at $0.305 AUD, down slightly from its 52-week high of $0.4925 AUD reached on May 19th, 2024. However, the stock has experienced significant fluctuations throughout the year, hitting a low of $0.20 AUD on September 8th, 2024. Despite these ups and downs, Lotus appears to be trading at a discount compared to its peers, with a price-to-earnings ratio of -20 and a price-to-book ratio of 3.88445. This suggests that investors may be overlooking the company's potential for growth and undervaluing its assets. Looking back at the company's historical performance, we can see that Lotus has consistently demonstrated resilience in the face of market volatility. In fact, the stock has recovered significantly since bottoming out in September, with a gain of nearly 60% in just over two months. This could indicate that the company is well-positioned to weather any future downturns and continue growing its value. From a technical standpoint, the stock's relative strength index (RSI) currently sits at 47.83, indicating that it is neither overbought nor oversold. Additionally, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator shows a bullish crossover, suggesting that the upward trend may continue in the short term. Overall, while there have been no recent news updates on Lotus Resources Ltd., the company's strong fundamentals and technical indicators suggest that it may be an attractive investment opportunity for those looking to capitalize on its long-term growth potential.

- Botanix (BOT.AX) traded up 1.43 % and now trades at AUD 0.34. Current market capitalisation for Botanix is AUD 636.1 mn. In a groundbreaking move, Chainlink has partnered with Botanix Labs to bring DeFi functionalities to Bitcoin for the first time. The collaboration integrates Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) into the Spiderchain network, enabling seamless interactions between Bitcoin and Ethereum-based DeFi apps. This expansion marks a significant milestone in the growth of DeFi on Bitcoin, providing users with access to a wider range of financial tools and services. Additionally, Botanix Labs has joined Chainlink's Scale program, further solidifying the partnership and paving the way for future developments in the space.

- Beacon Lighting (BLX.AX) traded down -4.56 % and now trades at AUD 2.9. Beacon Lighting has a market capitalisation of AUD 665 mn. Current price/earnings ratio for Beacon Lighting is 22.01.

- Tasmea (TEA.AX) traded up 0.34 % and now trades at AUD 2.91. Current market capitalisation for Tasmea is AUD 660.6 mn. Tasmea has a current price to earnings ratio of 13.52. Tasmea Limited: Technical Analysis Paints Promising Picture Investors looking for a compelling investment opportunity may want to take a closer look at Tasmea Limited (ASX: TAS), a company that has been steadily gaining momentum over the past few months. As of yesterday's closing bell, the stock closed at 2.84 AUD, just shy of its 52-week high of 2.89 AUD reached on October 24th. This marks a significant improvement from its 52-week low of 1.42 AUD hit on May 27th, indicating a strong upward trend. A quick glance at the company's financial ratios paints an equally promising picture. With a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 13.52 and a price-to-book ratio (P/B) of 4.46312, Tasmea appears to be undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. This could be a sign that the market has yet to fully recognize the company's growth potential. From a technical standpoint, the stock has been trading above its short-term moving averages, which suggests that buyers have been driving the price higher. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 61.8%, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, providing room for further upside. While there haven't been any recent news updates on Tasmea, the company's fundamentals and technical indicators paint a positive picture. In light of this, savvy investors may want to keep a close eye on Tasmea, as it could be poised for continued growth in the near future.

SECTION 2 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS

2.1 Uptrend

Price/Moving Average Price of 1.38 and positive MACD:

- The Price/MAP 200 for Civmec is 1.38. Being higher than 1 is a bullish indicator. It is higher than the Price/MAP 200 for the All Ordinaries Index of 1.03, a second bullish indicator.

Press Release article 2 of 6, 1151 words

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

SECTION 3 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS

3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 9.6% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 1.7%.

- The earnings yield of 9.6% is 2.1 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.5%.

(All figures in %)

Earnings Yield   9.6   
Australian avg   1.7   
Dividend Yield   6.6   
Bond Yield       4.5   

Dividend Yield > Bond Yield of 4.52%:

The dividend yield of 6.62% is 1.46 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.52%. The times factor of 1.46 is above the benchmark factor of 0.67 times set by Benjamin Graham.

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   6.62   
Bond Yield       4.52   
Spread           2.1    

The Dividend Yield of 6.6% is better than the Index average of 3.3%

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 6.6%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the All Ordinaries Index of 3.3% is 199.4%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

Press Release article 2 of 6, 1151 words

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

SECTION 3 BULLISH SIGNALS

3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 9.6% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 1.7%.

- The earnings yield of 9.6% is 2.1 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.5%.

(All figures in %)

Earnings Yield   9.6   
Australian avg   1.7   
Dividend Yield   6.6   
Bond Yield       4.5   

Dividend Yield > Bond Yield of 4.52%:

The dividend yield of 6.62% is 1.46 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.52%. The times factor of 1.46 is above the benchmark factor of 0.67 times set by Benjamin Graham.

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   6.62   
Bond Yield       4.52   
Spread           2.1    

The Dividend Yield of 6.6% is better than the Index average of 3.3%

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 6.6%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the All Ordinaries Index of 3.3% is 199.4%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

MCap/Total Assets:

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.8. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.5% in the last 3 years. This is better than the sector average of 5.4% and suggests a high margin of safety.

Press Release article 2 of 6, 1151 words

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 9.6% is 2.1 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.
