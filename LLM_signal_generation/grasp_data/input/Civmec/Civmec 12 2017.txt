4.15 Satisfies six criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 10.1 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.3 is 13.4. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 10% is 3.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.9%.

- The P/E of 10.1 is 0.3 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.7 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.9%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).

-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).

4.16 Satisfies 5 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.4 to 1.5.

- Improvement in asset turnover [growth in revenue of 24.4% exceeded growth in assets of 17.5%].

But does not meet the following 4 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Return on Assets improvement.

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in gross margin.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities." Link here.

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities." Link here.

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield equals the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).

-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities."

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities." Link here.

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities." Link here.

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

- The P/E of 10.1 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.4 is 13.7. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 9.9% is 2.2 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield equals the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).

-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).

-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

SECTION 2 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS

2.1 Other Bullish Signals

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.6 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

MCap/Total Assets:

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.7. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.5% in the last 3 years. This is better than the sector average of 5.5% and suggests a high margin of safety.

2.2 Oversold/Bullish/Support Signals:

- At $A1.28 the price is below the lower Bollinger band support of $A1.29, indicating an upside for it to return to the band.

SECTION 3 ONGOING BULLISH PARAMETERS

3.1 Past two-years

- Civmec rose for a second consecutive year. In the previous year the shares rose 37.25c (71.3%).

3.2 Created Market Value [CMV] past 5 yrs of $A280.6 million

- Market Capitalization has increased by $A430.5 million from $A220.4 million to $A650.9 million in the last 5 years. This increase comprises cumulative retained earnings (RETE) of $A149.9 million and Created Market Value of $A280.6 million. The Created Market Value multiple, defined by the change in MCap for every AUD1 of retained earnings is exemplary at $A2.87.

3.3 Satisfies six criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 9.8 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.3 is 13.1. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 10.2% is 2.3 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield equals the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).

-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).

-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

3.4 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.4 to 1.5.

- Reduction in total shares on issue.

- Improvement in asset turnover [growth in revenue of 24.4% exceeded growth in assets of 17.5%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Return on Assets improvement.

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Improvement in gross margin.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities." Link here.

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

- The P/E of 9.8 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.3 is 13.1. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 10.2% is 2.3 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield equals the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).

-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).

-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

SECTION 2 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS

2.1 Other Bullish Signals

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.6 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

MCap/Total Assets:

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.7. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.5% in the last 3 years. This is better than the sector average of 5.5% and suggests a high margin of safety.

2.2 Oversold/Bullish/Support Signals:

- At $A1.28 the price is below the lower Bollinger band support of $A1.29, indicating an upside for it to return to the band.

SECTION 3 ONGOING BULLISH PARAMETERS

3.1 Past two-years

- Civmec rose for a second consecutive year. In the previous year the shares rose 37.25c (71.3%).

3.2 Created Market Value [CMV] past 5 yrs of $A280.6 million

- Market Capitalization has increased by $A430.5 million from $A220.4 million to $A650.9 million in the last 5 years. This increase comprises cumulative retained earnings (RETE) of $A149.9 million and Created Market Value of $A280.6 million. The Created Market Value multiple, defined by the change in MCap for every AUD1 of retained earnings is exemplary at $A2.87.

3.3 Satisfies six criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 9.8 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.3 is 13.1. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 10.2% is 2.3 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield equals the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).

-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).

-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

3.4 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.4 to 1.5.

- Reduction in total shares on issue.

- Improvement in asset turnover [growth in revenue of 24.4% exceeded growth in assets of 17.5%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Return on Assets improvement.

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Improvement in gross margin.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities." Link here.

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

4.17 Satisfies six criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 9.8 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.3 is 13.1. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 10.2% is 2.3 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield equals the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).

-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).

-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

- Reduction in total shares on issue.

- Improvement in asset turnover [growth in revenue of 24.4% exceeded growth in assets of 17.5%].

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities."

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities."

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

SECTION 3 BULLISH SIGNALS

3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 10.2% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 1.9%.

- The earnings yield of 10.2% is 2.3 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.5%.

- The P/E of 9.9 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.3 is 13.0. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 10.1% is 3.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 3%.

- The P/E of 9.9 is 0.3 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.7 times the triple-A bond yield of 3%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).

-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).

2.16 Satisfies 5 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.4 to 1.5.

- Improvement in asset turnover [growth in revenue of 24.4% exceeded growth in assets of 17.5%].

But does not meet the following 4 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Return on Assets improvement.

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities."

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

- The P/E of 10.2 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.4 is 14.2. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 9.8% is 2.2 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield equals the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).

-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).

MCap/Total Assets:

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.7. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.5% in the last 3 years. This is better than the sector average of 5.5% and suggests a high margin of safety.

3.2 Created Market Value [CMV] past 5 yrs of $A316.1 million

The Created Market Value multiple, defined by the change in MCap for every AUD1 of retained earnings is exemplary at $A3.11.

3.3 Satisfies six criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 10.3 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.4 is 14.4. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield equals the triple-A bond yield of 4.4%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).

-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).

-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

3.4 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.4 to 1.5.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities." Link here.

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield equals the triple-A bond yield of 4.4%.

-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).

-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

SECTION 2 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS

2.1 Other Bullish Signals

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.6 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

MCap/Total Assets:

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.7. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.5% in the last 3 years. This is better than the sector average of 5.5% and suggests a high margin of safety.

SECTION 3 ONGOING BULLISH PARAMETERS

3.1 Past two-years

- Civmec rose for a second consecutive year. In the previous year the shares rose 38.53c (77.1%).

3.2 Created Market Value [CMV] past 5 yrs of $A316.1 million

- Market Capitalization has increased by $A466 million from $A215.4 million to $A681.4 million in the last 5 years. This increase comprises cumulative retained earnings (RETE) of $A149.9 million and Created Market Value of $A316.1 million. The Created Market Value multiple, defined by the change in MCap for every AUD1 of retained earnings is exemplary at $A3.11.

3.3 Satisfies six criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 10.3 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.4 is 14.4. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 9.7% is 2.2 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.4%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield equals the triple-A bond yield of 4.4%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD488.2 million (US$325.4 million).

-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD121.3 million (US$80.9 million) is 0.5 times the net liquidation value of AUD236.74 million (US$157.8 million).

-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

3.4 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.4 to 1.5.

- Reduction in total shares on issue.

- Improvement in asset turnover [growth in revenue of 24.4% exceeded growth in assets of 17.5%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Return on Assets improvement.

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Improvement in gross margin.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities." Link here.

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities."

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

November 13: Civmec awarded major shiploader project

Civmec is proud to announce that it has been awarded the design and construction works for the delivery of a new major shiploader. The project is for a replacement machine and comprises design, fabrication, preassembly, shipping and installation activities.

Engineering and design work will be undertaken by Civmec's in-house engineering team, followed by manufacture, preassembly and no-load commissioning being completed in Civmec's Henderson fabrication facilities. Once completed, the machine will be shipped by heavy lift vessel to its final destination for installation by Civmec at an existing Western Australian port facility. The shiploader is due for handover in 2028 and the total project value is expected to be in the region of A$90-100 million.

The project will create significant opportunities for local employment and subcontracting, reinforcing Civmec's commitment to contributing positively to the communities in which we operate. The project is anticipated to create over 100 highly specialised jobs.

Commenting on the shiploader award, Civmec's Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Patrick Tallon, said: "We are delighted to secure the award of this prestigious shiploader project which represents a significant advancement of our balance machine division, following on from the recent award from Alcoa for a new bridge reclaimer, and establishes Civmec as a key Original Equipment Manufacturer supplier of high-quality balance machines for Tier 1 clients around Australia. Civmec continues to expand its footprint in the balance machines sector, including stackers, reclaimers and shiploaders, in anticipation of at least 30-40 new, replacement and major refurbishments of balance machines that will be required across Australia over the next 10 years".

October 28: ASI Australian Steel Excellence Award for shiploader replacement project

Civmec's work on the Shiploader and Berth Replacement (SABR) Project - Shiploader has been recognised, with the project team winning the QLD NT Australian Steel Institute (ASI) 2024 Steel Excellence Awards for Engineering Projects. Civmec accepts the award alongside DBM Vircon, Aurecon, BlueScope and International Protective Coatings.

The ASI commented, "The Australian Steel Excellence Awards promotes excellence in Australian steel and profiles the strength, beauty and versatility of steel as a prime building material. Hay Point Shiploader is listed as one of the largest shiploaders to be built globally. It is truly a complex structure as it is not just static and has moving parts. Constructing this structure in modular designs allowed for streamlining of other work to occur to ensure that time was managed well in delivering and assembling the project. It was great to hear the client comment to you that they felt 'this was the best machine they have seen ever produced'. Well done on such a successful project."

Civmec was awarded the SABR shiploader contract in 2020 by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA). The scope included the supply, fabrication, surface treatment, assembly, and no-load commissioning of the 2,000-tonne shiploader, with the majority of the work undertaken at Civmec Henderson, supported by Civmec Newcastle.

October 16: Civmec : Chairman's Statement

Executive Chairman's Statement

Back in 2009, we had a vision: to create a successful, multidisciplined organisation with a variety of diverse and integrated capabilities. One of our early goals was to prove to our customers the value of local manufacturing and encourage more heavy engineering projects to stay within Australian shores. To this end, we are consistently achieving this goal, with an increasing number of clients realising that value, seeking out our services and returning to us, repeatedly, to deliver to their requirements.

Fittingly, this is our first Annual Report since announcing our intention to redomicile the head company from Singapore to Australia. This became effective on 4 September 2024, through a restructuring of the company by way of a scheme of arrangement. We greatly value both our Australian and Singaporean shareholders and we are optimistic that this will further position Civmec as the contractor of choice for future Australian content requirements, not only increasing our opportunity pool, but further strengthening the business and its overall appeal to investors.

Financial Performance

I am pleased to report that in FY24, Civmec achieved exceptional financial results, culminating in our revenue surpassing A$1 billion for the first time in our history. Furthermore, we attained our highest ever Net Profit After Tax figure, A$64.4 million - a remarkable achievement that reflects our unrelenting commitment to growth.

We strengthened our cash position, transitioning from a net borrowing position of A$76.5 million in FY19 to a net cash position of A$24.5 million (excluding lease liabilities). Our increased net assets now stand at an impressive A$488.2 million. These achievements underscore the effectiveness of our financial strategy over the past fifteen years. We will continue to focus on cash generation and the maintenance of a strong balance sheet to support our strong operational performance and growth strategy.

Dividends

Our objective at Civmec is to create value for shareholders through delivering consistent, stable and reliable returns. Since our listing on the ASX, we have generated A$232.2 million in profit and returned more than A$75.5 million to our shareholders through dividends.

Our Board of Directors has declared a final cash dividend of A$0.035 per share. The payment will bring the full-year dividend to A$0.06 per share, representing a 47% payout ratio, and will be paid on 25 October 2024.

People

Our people are the heartbeat of our direct operations and support services, and, without them, we wouldn't be where we are today. During FY24, we provided employment either directly or indirectly for over 4,000 people, including almost 150 apprentices, graduates, and trainees.

We also continued to equip workers with additional skills, delivering 56 units of competency to almost 2,500 participants through our in-house registered training organisation (RTO).

Our leadership and professional development programs, such as our internal LEAD program, were ongoing, reaffirming our strong commitment to the promotion of organic growth within the company. In fact, this year, it is pleasing to report that around 90 people completed our leading hand or supervisory position courses, successfully progressing to the next stages of their career with us.

It's important that everyone at Civmec feels equally valued and welcome, so we continue to promote diversity across our facilities and sites with visible action and representation. This year, a personal highlight of mine was hosting the Matagarup Elders Group for a tour of our Henderson facility, during which the group generously provided insight into their culture and connection to the lands and waters in Perth.

Sustainability

Our journey towards a more sustainable future continues, as we strive for the most effective management of our environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, obligations and opportunities. The Board has committed to a target of net zero emissions by 2050, and to achieve this has set a target of greater than 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (compared to 2022 levels).

On the topic of sustainability, I would like to highlight the Causeway Pedestrian and Cyclist Bridges Project, underway during FY24. Throughout the project, great respect has been shown for the environment and the rich Aboriginal history of the site. The project has embraced diversity, with equal representation of males and females in management roles, and two thirds of the site apprentices and trainees of Aboriginal descent. The project is also a prime example of effective collaboration between non-Indigenous and Indigenous businesses. A detailed case study on the project is included within this report on page 52.

Governance

At Civmec, we are unwavering in our commitment to responsible corporate governance and transparency, striving for the highest levels of integrity and accountability. For the past twelve years, we have done so with the support of Independent Directors Chong Teck Sin, Wong Fook Choy Sunny, and Douglas Owen Chester, whose time with us will end in October 2024 due to SGX Listing Rules on director independence.

We are pleased to announce that the nomination committee has shortlisted new Independent Directors to ensure that the Board holds the required skills, commitment, and knowledge whilst having a diverse range of perspectives. These individuals will be nominated for shareholder approval at the AGM. New Independent Directors Ms. Ong Beng Hong, Mr. Gary Gray, and Mr. Ambrose Law bring with them a diverse range of skills and experience. Ms. Ong Beng Hong is the Joint Managing Director of Wong Tan & Molly Lim LLC, specialising in corporate, banking, finance, and capital markets law.

Mr. Gary Gray is a distinguished professional with experience as the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, a former member of the Australian Parliament, and in senior executive and Board member roles. Mr. Ambrose Law is a seasoned Chartered Accountant with extensive experience in senior financial roles across multiple countries. I am confident that their strategic guidance and oversight will add great value, as we continue to deliver safely, sustainably, and in the best interests of our stakeholders.

Outlook

Looking ahead, I believe that Civmec is well positioned for our next chapter. During a recent strategy session with our executive leadership team, we outlined high-level targets and a staged, planned approach to achieve certain goals by 2030, signifying a new stage of our business that I am excited to see unfold. With a clear roadmap in place, a well-established platform for growth, and a strong executive team who are achievement focused, we have all the foundations set for building long-term, sustainable value.

To conclude, I wish to thank all those who have played a role in our success, not just this year, but since we opened our doors in 2009. This includes our employees, our delivery partners, suppliers, clients, executive management team and our Board. As we prepare to bid our current Independent Directors farewell, I would like to take the opportunity to sincerely thank them for their insight and guidance over the years. Their contributions have been instrumental in our journey of success.

Finally, to our shareholders, thank you for your continued trust and confidence in Civmec. Your ongoing support and encouragement are much appreciated.

October 16: Civmec: New Defence Precinct at Henderson

Civmec Limited welcomes the joint announcement by the Commonwealth of Australia and Western Australia State Government regarding the creation of a new Defence precinct at Henderson to deliver continuous naval shipbuilding and nuclear-powered submarine maintenance. Civmec's Executive Chairman, Mr. Jim Fitzgerald, said "the sheer scale of the proposed infrastructure investment in Henderson and the magnitude of the opportunities it will present for us, a proven construction and defence contractor, is potentially a game changer for these divisions of our business. It represents a monumental day for Western Australia and should be welcome news to the entire State. It is in the national interest that we have this capability and capacity on the west coast. This new infrastructure will play a crucial role in WA's ability to effectively deliver and/or sustain these large Naval vessels and nuclear-powered submarines."

"Civmec is working with the Department of Defence, along with the State and Federal Governments on suitable alternate land options in the immediate vicinity for the establishment of a new State-owned Common User Facilities with the infrastructure and capabilities that can support current and future non-defence industries, activities and projects. This planning work is underpinned by the commitments made in the Cooperation Agreement between the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Western Australia to deliver and sustain Australia's future Defence capabilities." Link here.

"In terms of the vital work Civmec does for the sectors outside of Defence, we continue to be forward leaning and are engaging closely with all relevant stakeholders to ensure there is minimal disruption to our critical resources, energy, and infrastructure projects that rely on daily access to the Henderson Common User Facility."

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.
