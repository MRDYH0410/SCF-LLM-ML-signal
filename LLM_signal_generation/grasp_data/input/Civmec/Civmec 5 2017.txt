SECTION 1 BULLISH SIGNALS

1.1 Price/Earnings of 8.2 < Construction and Engineering sector (of 45 stocks) avg of 13.3:

- The price-to-earnings ratio of 8.2 indicates undervaluation compared with sector average of 13.3 and market average of 11.8.

1.2 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 12.2% is more attractive compared with the Singapore average earning yield of 8.5%.

- The earnings yield of 12.2% is 3.6 times the 10-year bond yield of 3.4%.

(All figures in %)

Earnings Yield   12.2   
Singapore avg    8.5    
Dividend Yield   6.0    
Bond Yield       3.4    

Dividend Yield > Bond Yield of 3.36%:

The dividend yield of 6.02% is 1.79 times the triple-A bond yield of 3.36%. The times factor of 1.79 is above the benchmark factor of 0.67 times set by Benjamin Graham.

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   6.02   
Bond Yield       3.36   
Spread           2.66   

The Dividend Yield of 6% is better than the Index average of 5.0%

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 6%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the Straits Times Index of 5.0% is 121.4%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

2.18 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 8.2 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.1 is 8.9. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 12.3% is 3.6 times the triple-A bond yield of 3.4%.

- The P/E of 8.2 is 0.3 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.8 times the triple-A bond yield of 3.4%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).

2.19 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

SECTION 2 BULLISH SIGNALS

2.1 Price/Earnings of 8.6 < Capital Goods sector (of 68 stocks) avg of 34.7:

- The price-to-earnings ratio of 8.6 indicates undervaluation compared with sector average of 34.7 and market average of 25.0.

Price to Book of 0.5 < Capital Goods sector (of 68 stocks) average of 7.2:

- The Price to Book of 0.5 indicates undervaluation compared with sector average of 7.2 and 3.0 for the Australian Market.

2.2 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

3.16 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 8.6 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.5 is 4.6. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 11.7% is 2.6 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.3 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings"; there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

3.17 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

With a strong upward trend, favorable valuation metrics, and increasing trading volume, investors may want to keep a close eye on this Australian airline. However, it's important to note that the aviation industry is highly competitive and subject to various external factors such as fuel costs, geopolitical tensions, and global economic conditions. Therefore, any investment decisions should be made after thorough research and consultation with a financial advisor.

- Csl (CSL.AX) traded up 0.47 % and now trades at AUD 279.1. Current market capitalisation for Csl is AUD 133.1 bn. Csl has a current price to earnings ratio of 35.96. Biotech Firm Csl Soars to New Heights with Promising COVID-19 Vaccine Data Shares of Australian biotechnology company Csl (CSL.AX) have been on an upward trajectory in recent months, buoyed by promising data from clinical trials of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate. According to the latest figures available, the stock closed at a record high of 280.92 AUD on May 20th, representing a significant increase from its 52-week low of 228.65 AUD in October 2023. The surge in investor interest can be attributed to the publication of pivotal data demonstrating the efficacy and tolerability of Csl's COVID-19 vaccine, as reported by Nature Communications on May 20th. This development has sparked renewed optimism among analysts and investors alike, who see the potential for this vaccine to make a meaningful impact in the fight against the virus. From a technical standpoint, Csl's stock appears to be in a strong uptrend, with a series of higher highs and higher lows over the past several months. This trend has been driven by a combination of improving fundamentals, including increased demand for the company's products and services, as well as growing investor confidence in the company's long-term prospects. Looking ahead, the next key level of resistance for Csl's stock may be found around the 312.99 AUD mark, which represents the all-time high reached on June 5th of last year. If the stock can successfully breach this level, it could open the door to even higher prices in the near term. However, it's important to note that the biotechnology sector is inherently volatile, and there are always risks associated with investing in individual companies. As such, investors should conduct thorough research and consult with their financial advisors before making any investment decisions regarding Csl or any other security.

- Westpac Banking (WBC.AX) traded down -0.41 % and now trades at AUD 27.34. Westpac Banking has a market capitalisation of AUD 94 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Westpac Banking is 14.5. Title: Technical Analysis: Westpac Banking's Mixed Signals Investors looking to gauge the performance of Westpac Banking (WBK) may be scratching their heads after the latest financial results and market trends. Despite posting strong half-year earnings, the stock has struggled to break above its 52-week high, leaving analysts divided on the company's future prospects. In this technical analysis, we'll dive into the numbers to determine if WBK is a buy, sell, or hold. Westpac Banking closed at $26.75 AUD on May 6th, just shy of its 52-week high of $28.05 AUD reached on May 7th, 2024. This marks a significant improvement from the previous year's low of $20.03 AUD on June 6th, 2023. However, the stock has been trading sideways since then, failing to make any substantial gains. Financial Highlights: According to the most recent earnings call transcript available, Westpac Banking reported solid half-year results, with net profit after tax (NPAT) up 11% compared to the prior corresponding period (PCP). The company attributed this growth to increased lending volumes and improved margins. Notably, the price to earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) stands at 14.5041, indicating that investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of earnings. Moving Averages: Short-term moving averages paint a mixed picture for WBK. The stock's 20-day moving average is $27.11 AUD, while the 50-day moving average sits at $26.39 AUD. These indicators suggest that the stock may be experiencing a short-term correction before potentially resuming its upward trend. Support and Resistance: Key support levels for WBK include $26.50 AUD and $25.00 AUD, based on the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, respectively. Meanwhile, resistance lies at $28.05 AUD, the 52-week high. A break above this level could trigger a rally towards $30.00 AUD. Conclusion: While Westpac Banking's recent financial results were encouraging, the stock's inability to sustain gains above $28.05 AUD raises concerns about its long-term potential. From a technical standpoint, the stock appears range-bound between $25.00 AUD and $28.05 AUD, with a slight bias towards the downside. Therefore, investors should exercise caution when considering an investment in WBK, and wait for a clear breakout or pullback before making a decision.

- Apa (APA.AX) traded down -0.81 % and now trades at AUD 8.7. Current market capitalisation for Apa is AUD 10.8 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Apa is 9.09. **Apa's Market Performance Under Scrutiny** In an era where market fluctuations can be unpredictable, investors have been keeping a keen eye on APA group's performance over the past year. According to data available until August 2023, there has been little movement regarding significant events or announcements affecting the stock. As we delve into the numbers, it becomes clear that Apa's share value experienced some volatility during this period. On May 9th, 2023, the 52-week high stood at AU$10.52 before gradually declining towards July-August levels around AU$8.50. However, since then, the trend appears to have reversed slightly with a slight increase up to AU$8.27 by the time our records cut off (August 2023). Technical analysts may find interest in comparing these figures against other key metrics such as Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E) and Book Value per Share (BVPS). As reported, Apa boasts a P/E ratio of approximately 8.93 – indicating moderate growth expectations compared to industry peers. Meanwhile, the BVPS stands at roughly 2.95, suggesting reasonable valuation considering historical trends. While further developments might shed more light on future prospects, one thing remains certain: Apa continues to fascinate traders seeking insight into potential investment opportunities amidst shifting global markets.

- Computershare (CPU.AX) traded down -0.26 % and now trades at AUD 27.36. Computershare has a market capitalisation of AUD 15.6 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Computershare is 21.11. Title: Computershare's Migration to Nutanix Boosts Growth Prospects In a move aimed at enhancing its technology infrastructure, Computershare has successfully migrated 24,000 virtual machines (VMs) onto Nutanix's cloud platform, according to a recent report by IT News. This strategic migration is expected to drive growth and improve the company's competitive position in the market. From a technical perspective, the stock's performance over the past year has been impressive, with the shares trading at an all-time high of $28.435 AUD on April 11, 2024. The closing price of $26.7 AUD on May 23, 2024, represents a modest pullback, providing investors with an attractive entry point into the stock. Looking at the company's financial metrics, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 21.1113, indicating that the stock is slightly overvalued compared to its peers. However, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 4.97952 suggests that the stock is still reasonably priced based on its assets. Despite the slight pullback in recent days, the long-term outlook for Computershare remains positive, driven by the successful migration to Nutanix and the company's commitment to innovation and technological advancement. Investors looking for exposure to the technology sector may want to consider adding Computershare to their watchlists or portfolios. * Last Close Price: $26.7 AUD * 52 Weeks High: $28.435 AUD (April 11, 2024) * 52 Weeks Low: $21.85 AUD (June 5, 2023) * P/E Ratio: 21.1113 * P/B Ratio: 4.97952

4.15 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 8.8 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.6 is 4.9. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 11.4% is 2.6 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.4%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.3 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.4%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings";there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.4%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings";there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

CIVMEC LIMITED: Q3 FY2024 Business Update Another Strong Quarter - Plus Media Premium Official News

{{20240511T205049.160+0000}}CIVMEC LIMITED: Q3 FY2024 Business Update Another Strong QuarterSydney, Australia: CIVMEC LIMITED has issued the following news release:

Civmec Limited (“Civmec” or the “Group”) is pleased to announce its financial results for the third quarter ended 31 March 2024 (Q3 FY24), delivering increased revenue and profits together with a stronger balance sheet. 

Chairman James Fitzgerald said: “I am proud to announce another strong quarter for our shareholders, with continued growth in both top line revenue and bottom line earnings and resilient profit margins. An increase in the volume of maintenance related awards reflects our increasing focus on maintenance works as a significant pillar of growth for the company.” 
 Operational Update 
 Maintenance Awards: 
 With a continuous focus on the growth of the service offerings and expansion of client base, Civmec is delighted to announce a series of panel contract awards in the maintenance sector both on the west and east coast of Australia. The Contracts include: 
 • 
 A contract for process plant punchlist works on at a recently completed construction site in the Pilbara which sees Civmec providing multi-discipline labour for modifications and shutdowns on the site.

• 
 A master agreement for engineering, procurement and construction activities for Wesfarmers Chemicals, Energy and Fertilisers (WESCEF) in support of its brownfield projects including construction services and temporary labour hire. 
 • 
 Various shutdown contracts for Cargill’s facility located in Newcastle, NSW. Civmec will perform fabrication and site shutdown services for a plant upgrade including change out and modifications on existing equipment. 
 • 
 Fabrication and and installation of new gangways and associated components at a site in the Pilbara. This project includes fabrication, carry out required Structural, mechanical and piping installation (SMP) as well as, remediation electrical, communications and commissioning activities. 
 • 
 A shutdown and maintenance services call-off agreement awarded by Pilbara Minerals. This contract involves the supply of labour, plant and equipment and other services to support shutdowns at the Pilgangoora Operation. 
 • 
 Ongoing dump truck tray replacement orders that maintain Civmec’s production rates for tray replacements at it’s Newcastle facility. 
 • 
 Continued awards under existing panel and term agreements with existing clients. 
 With final finishings allowing Civmec’s Port Hedland maintenance and workshop facility to now be practically complete, the focus will be on increasing utilisation of the facility and offering employment and apprenticeship opportunities to the local community as opportunities arise. 
 Civmec is also finalising land and facility plans for our Queensland maintenance hub in Gladstone which in turn will also create a new line of opportunity for the east coast based maintenance team. 
 Construction Awards: 
 Pilbara Minerals P1000 expansion project 
 Further demonstrating Civmec’s diversified service offering, the company has also secured a contract for the site installation of structural, mechanical, piping, and E&I components with Pilbara Minerals on the P1000 Expansion Project at their lithium operation near Port Hedland, Western Australia. This contract encompasses a broad range of Civmec’s in-house capabilities and underscores our integrated approach to project delivery. This will be our second package of work for Pilbara Minerals as we near the completion of the fabrication of components for their P680 Expansion Project. 
 Manufacturing Awards : 
 Chevron Gorgon CCS Fabrication and Preassembly (Modules) 
 Civmec has been awarded a comprehensive supply contract to deliver multiple steel and pipe modules for the Gorgon Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) system This contract highlights Civmec’s robust capability in heavy engineering and our commitment to supporting the energy sector with high-quality solutions. 
 To be delivered from our extensive facilities in Henderson, Western Australia, Civmec will complete procurement, manufacture, assembly and testing of a series of modules, loose steel and piping for the project.

Defence Update 
 As outlined in the Australian Government’s recently announced ‘Independent analysis of Navy’s surface combatant fleet’, the initial requirements for 12 OPVs has been reduced to six vessels. Having recently completed our scope of supply for six vessels, Civmec has redeployed its shipbuilding workforce of staff, tradespeople, apprentices and trainees to support other existing contracts while more clarity on medium to longer term shipbuilding requirements is better understood. This underscores the Company’s diversity of contracts, not being reliant on one sector and being flexible enough to transfer personnel to contracts in another sector pending the award of further defence work. 
 Leasing of space at Civmec’s Henderson facility to our client for the consolidation of vessels is unaffected by this change. The change in Commonwealth requirement for the quantity of OPVs will not have any material impact on FY24 revenue or profits. 
 The long term outlook for shipbuilding is promising with a forecast spend over the next 10 years in the Henderson precinct forecast to be over A$25 billion. 
 Order Book 
 Tendering activities across the Group’s operations is at historically high levels, with current priced opportunities approaching A$10 billion as Civmec works closely with a range of clients on approved expansion, sustaining and maintenance opportunities as well as on a budgetary level for projects under feasibility studies. As a result of these engagements, Civmec sees significant opportunity for both order book replenishment and growth in the medium and longer term. 
 Taking into account these new awards and the reduced OPV program, Civmec’s order book currently stands at approximately A$821 million. 
 Re-Domicile Update 
 In view of Civmec’s operations and workforce being entirely Australian based, and Australian tax resident, on 27 October 2023, Civmec announced the proposed change of domicile of the head company of the group from Civmec Limited (domiciled in Singapore) to Civmec Australia Limited (domiciled in Australia). The change in domicile will be achieved through a restructuring of the Company by way of a scheme of arrangement which will position Civmec to better meet local content requirements, increasing the number of available opportunities for Civmec. 
 The Company is working with relevant regulatory bodies in Australia and Singapore to finalise the scheme documents and gain the relevant regulatory approvals before submitting the proposal to a shareholder vote. Updates on the timing of this will be provided as this information becomes available.Copyright (c) 2024 Right Vision Media

SECTION 3 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS

Price/Earnings of 8.3 < Capital Goods sector (of 68 stocks) avg of 35.5:

- The price-to-earnings ratio of 8.3 indicates undervaluation compared with sector average of 35.5 and market average of 25.1.

Price to Book of 0.5 < Capital Goods sector (of 68 stocks) average of 7.4:

- The Price to Book of 0.5 indicates undervaluation compared with sector average of 7.4 and 3.0 for the Australian Market.

3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 12.1% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 4%.

Australian avg   4      
Dividend Yield   6.0    
Bond Yield       4.4    

Dividend Yield > Bond Yield of 4.36%:

The dividend yield of 6.04% is 1.39 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.36%. The times factor of 1.39 is above the benchmark factor of 0.67 times set by Benjamin Graham.

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   6.04

The Dividend Yield of 6% is better than the Index average of 3.8%

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 6%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the All Ordinaries Index of 3.8% is 160.6%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

- The P/E of 8.1 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.5 is 4.1. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 12.4% is 2.8 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.4%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.4%.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings";there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.
