Investors look to see if Civmec's recent rally will continue - Global Round Up - Stocks

{{20240925T000935.239+0000}}Investors look to see if Civmec's recent rally will continueSINGAPOREAN STOCK REPORT

Ahead of this morning's market opening, Civmec has shown some strength in recent days. Civmec (SI:P9D), Singapore's largest Construction and Engineering company by market cap, lifted 1.0% during its previous trading session to close at 99.0 Singapore cent.

Bullish Turning Point

Price/Earnings of 10.2 close to historical low

The P/E of 10.2 is 0.3 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

2.18 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 10.2 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.4 is 13.9. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 9.8% is 4 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.5%.

- The P/E of 10.2 is 0.3 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 2 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.5%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

Civmec Australia is trading 0 percent unchanged with a volume of AUD 15.7 k on Tuesday 24th of September - Stockpulse

{{20240924T180957.374+0000}}Civmec Australia is trading 0 percent unchanged with a volume of AUD 15.7 k on Tuesday 24th of SeptemberSep 24, 2024

Civmec Australia (CVLDA.OLD.AX) traded flat 0 % during a 24 hours period ending at 07:54 PM Central Europe on Tuesday 24th. One Civmec Australia stock can currently be bought for about AUD 1.16 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Civmec Australia stocks is 507.6 mn. Civmec Australia has a current market capitalization of AUD 494.9 mn and approximately AUD 15.7 k worth of Civmec Australia was traded on exchanges in the last 24 hours. Since last month end, Civmec Australia has traded 10.48 % up. Simple moving average of last 200 days is at AUD 0.98. The highest price of past 52 weeks was recorded at AUD 1.3 on 08/05/2024. 52 weeks low was at AUD 0.86 on 05/07/2024.

Here is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:

- Pepper Money -Australia (PPM.AX) traded down -1.9 % and now trades at AUD 1.27. Pepper Money -Australia has a market capitalisation of AUD 580.1 mn. Current price/earnings ratio for Pepper Money -Australia is 5.93.

- Pacific Current (PAC.AX) traded up 0.28 % and now trades at AUD 10.59. Pacific Current has a market capitalisation of AUD 562.7 mn. Current price/earnings ratio for Pacific Current is 5.07. Pacific Current Group Ltd: Technical Analysis As of September 22nd, 2024, Pacific Current Group Ltd (PCG) has been trading steadily with minimal recent news. The last known news report dates back to August 26th, 2024, when PCG released its full-year 2024 earnings call transcript. Since then, the stock has maintained a consistent trend, with little volatility in both upward and downward directions. Currently, PCG is trading at $10.77 AUD per share, slightly above its 52-week low of $7.95 AUD reached on November 15th, 2023. However, the stock remains below its 52-week high of $11.495 AUD achieved on September 2nd, 2024. This suggests that while investor sentiment may be improving, there is still room for growth before reaching previous highs. From a technical standpoint, PCG's price to earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) stands at 5.1, indicating that the market values each dollar of the company's earnings at approximately five times their worth. Additionally, the price to book ratio (P/B Ratio) is 0.94364, suggesting that investors are willing to pay nearly one dollar for every dollar of the company's book value. These ratios indicate that PCG may be undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. Looking ahead, potential investors may want to keep an eye on PCG's future earnings reports and any developments related to the company's operations or industry trends. If the company can continue to demonstrate strong financial performance and growth, the stock could potentially see increased demand and higher prices in the near term.

- Develop Global (DVP.AX) traded down -1.9 % and now trades at AUD 2.09. Develop Global has a market capitalisation of AUD 531.6 mn.

- Latin (LRS.AX) traded down -2.56 % and now trades at AUD 0.2. Latin has a market capitalisation of AUD 541.5 mn. Headline: Technical Analysis: Latin Resources Ltd's Price Plummets Despite Strong Fundamentals In a recent webinar series, Latin Resources Ltd (LAT) showcased its impressive portfolio of mining assets and outlined its growth strategy for the upcoming year. However, despite these positive developments, the company's stock has experienced a significant decline in value over the past few months. As of yesterday's closing bell, LAT closed at $0.20 per share, down from its 52-week high of $0.315 on September 18th, 2023. A closer look at LAT's financial statements reveals that the company's price-to-earnings ratio stands at -23.38, indicating that investors are currently paying less for each dollar of earnings compared to historical averages. Additionally, the price-to-book ratio of 4.35 suggests that the market is undervaluing LAT's assets relative to its peers. Despite these attractive valuations, LAT's stock performance has been weighed down by a lack of recent news updates. The last known news report dates back to March 8th, 2024, when the company participated in the Red Cloud Virtual Webinar Series. Since then, there have been no further announcements or developments that may have impacted investor sentiment. From a technical standpoint, LAT's chart pattern suggests a potential reversal in the near future. The stock has been trending downwards since reaching its peak in September 2023, but has recently found support at around $0.20 per share. If buyers can push the stock above this level, it could signal a possible uptrend in the making. Overall, while LAT's fundamentals remain strong, the absence of recent news and the lack of momentum in its stock price may be causing hesitation among investors. However, with attractive valuations and a potentially reversible downtrend, savvy investors may view this as an opportunity to accumulate shares at a discount before the market recognizes the company's true worth.

- Ipd -Australia (IPG.AX) traded up 0.2 % and now trades at AUD 5.07. Ipd -Australia has a market capitalisation of AUD 529.3 mn. Ipd -Australia has a current price to earnings ratio of 22.08.Copyright (c) 2024 Stockpulse

One Civmec Australia stock can currently be bought for about AUD 1.16 on popular exchanges. Current supply of Civmec Australia stocks is 507.6 mn.

Here is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:

- Pepper Money -Australia (PPM.AX) traded down -1.9 % and now trades at AUD 1.27. Pepper Money -Australia has a market capitalisation of AUD 580.1 mn. Current price/earnings ratio for Pepper Money -Australia is 5.93.

Pacific Current Group Ltd: Technical Analysis As of September 22nd, 2024, Pacific Current Group Ltd (PCG) has been trading steadily with minimal recent news. The last known news report dates back to August 26th, 2024, when PCG released its full-year 2024 earnings call transcript. Since then, the stock has maintained a consistent trend, with little volatility in both upward and downward directions. Currently, PCG is trading at $10.77 AUD per share, slightly above its 52-week low of $7.95 AUD reached on November 15th, 2023. However, the stock remains below its 52-week high of $11.495 AUD achieved on September 2nd, 2024. This suggests that while investor sentiment may be improving, there is still room for growth before reaching previous highs. From a technical standpoint, PCG's price to earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) stands at 5.1, indicating that the market values each dollar of the company's earnings at approximately five times their worth. Additionally, the price to book ratio (P/B Ratio) is 0.94364, suggesting that investors are willing to pay nearly one dollar for every dollar of the company's book value. These ratios indicate that PCG may be undervalued compared to its peers in the industry. Looking ahead, potential investors may want to keep an eye on PCG's future earnings reports and any developments related to the company's operations or industry trends. If the company can continue to demonstrate strong financial performance and growth, the stock could potentially see increased demand and higher prices in the near term.

However, despite these positive developments, the company's stock has experienced a significant decline in value over the past few months. As of yesterday's closing bell, LAT closed at $0.20 per share, down from its 52-week high of $0.315 on September 18th, 2023. A closer look at LAT's financial statements reveals that the company's price-to-earnings ratio stands at -23.38, indicating that investors are currently paying less for each dollar of earnings compared to historical averages. Additionally, the price-to-book ratio of 4.35 suggests that the market is undervaluing LAT's assets relative to its peers. Despite these attractive valuations, LAT's stock performance has been weighed down by a lack of recent news updates. The last known news report dates back to March 8th, 2024, when the company participated in the Red Cloud Virtual Webinar Series. Since then, there have been no further announcements or developments that may have impacted investor sentiment. From a technical standpoint, LAT's chart pattern suggests a potential reversal in the near future. The stock has been trending downwards since reaching its peak in September 2023, but has recently found support at around $0.20 per share. If buyers can push the stock above this level, it could signal a possible uptrend in the making. Overall, while LAT's fundamentals remain strong, the absence of recent news and the lack of momentum in its stock price may be causing hesitation among investors. However, with attractive valuations and a potentially reversible downtrend, savvy investors may view this as an opportunity to accumulate shares at a discount before the market recognizes the company's true worth.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings";there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

The Long-Term Bullish Case For Civmec - News Bites Asia - Singapore

{{20240916T080740.561+0000}}The Long-Term Bullish Case For CivmecSINGAPOREAN STOCK REPORT

Civmec (SI:P9D) has jumped 24.0% Year To Date. There is uncertainty in the market and it is difficult to predict how economic conditions will be in 2024 and beyond as well as what the impact of those conditions may be on Civmec. However, there are several key reasons why some investors remain bullish on the long-term prospects for Civmec.

Below are some of those key reasons:

- The dividend yield of 5.16% is 2.06 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.51%. The times factor of 2.06 is above the benchmark factor of 0.67 times set by Benjamin Graham.

- Earnings yield of 10.2% is more attractive compared with the Singapore average earning yield of 8.4%.

- The price-to-earnings ratio of 9.8 indicates undervaluation compared with sector average of 13.2 and market average of 11.9.

- Return on Assets of 7.4% versus sector average of 2.3% and market average of 1.5%.

- Return on Equity of 13.7% versus sector average of 4.3% and market average of 6.3%.

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.3 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

- As per the Du Pont analysis, Return on Equity of 13.7% is better than sector average of 4.3%. This is computed as net profit margin of 6.9% times asset turnover [sales/assets] of 1.1 times leverage factor [total assets/shareholders' equity] of 1.8.

- LONG-TERM FUNDAMENTAL RANKING: 4 OUT OF 5 [5 is best]; It has a strong relative ROE of 13.7% and ROA of 7.4%. The company paid a dividend of 2.20c in the last twelve months. The dividend yield is high at 5.2%. Finally, its earnings growth in the past 12 months has been a comparatively high 10%.

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.7. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued.

P/E/G < 1

The price earnings ratio of 9.8 divided by trailing twelve months eps growth of 10.0% corresponds to an attractive P/E/G of 1.0 times; this is better than sector average of 1.6.

EPS Growth (%)   10.0   
P/E/G            0.99   
P/E              9.78   

Improved EBIT Margins:

EBIT margin is positive and has seen consecutive rises in the last 4 years.

FY     EBIT Margins (%)   
2023   9.9                
2022   8.6

2020   5.8                
2019   1.8                

Low Debt to Equity (%) and Reducing

The debt to equity ratio of 15.9% is under a safe benchmark figure of 50%. Moreover, it has improved in the past four years.

Years      Debt to Equity (%)   
Jun 2023   15.86                
Jun 2022   22.79                
Jun 2021   24.12                
Jun 2020   27.79                
Jun 2019   67.29                

Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 9.8 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.3 is 12.8. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 10.2% is 4.1 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.5%.

- The P/E of 9.8 is 0.3 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 2.1 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.5%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).

Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.
