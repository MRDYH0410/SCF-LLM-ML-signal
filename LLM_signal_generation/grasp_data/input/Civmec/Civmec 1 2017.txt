{{20240119T061315.665+0000}}Civmec (CVL: 91.0c) offers earnings yield of 12.1% ; +1c [1.1%] Vol Index 1.8 [1 is avg]AUSTRALIAN END-OF-DAY STOCK REPORT

Civmec Limited (ASX:CVL) Australia's 17th largest Capital goods company by market cap, ranks 20 in the Top 20 by earnings yield stocks in the Total Australian Market ex All Ordinaries Index of 1605 stocks.

Note: Earnings yield is the inverse of the P/E ratio.

FY 2023 EPS: 11.0c;

The earnings yield of 12.1% is 2.8 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.264%.

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

SECTION 3 BULLISH SIGNALS

3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 12.1% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 5.1%.

- The earnings yield of 12.1% is 2.8 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.3%.

(All figures in %)

Earnings Yield   12.1   
Australian avg   5.1    
Dividend Yield   5.5    
Bond Yield       4.3    

Dividend Yield > Bond Yield of 4.26%:

The dividend yield of 5.49% is 1.29 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.26%. The times factor of 1.29 is above the benchmark factor of 0.67 times set by Benjamin Graham.

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   5.49   
Bond Yield       4.26   
Spread           1.23   

The Dividend Yield of 5.5% is better than the Index average of 4.0%

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 5.5%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the All Ordinaries Index of 4.0% is 137.6%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

3.2 Other Bullish Signals

- Return on Equity of 13.7% versus sector average of 8.9% and market average of 10.9%.

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.3 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

- Return on Capital Employed of 14.3% versus sector average of 9.4% and market average of 3.8%.

MCap/Total Assets:

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.3. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued and ranks in the top quartile of stocks by value of Q Ratio.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.1% in the last 3 years. This is better than the sector average of 6.0% and suggests a high margin of safety.

- As per the Du Pont analysis, Return on Equity of 13.7% is better than sector average of 8.9%. This is computed as net profit margin of 6.9% times asset turnover [sales/assets] of 1.1 times leverage factor [total assets/shareholders' equity] of 1.8.

4.7 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 8.3 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.5 is 4.3. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 12.1% is 2.8 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.3%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.3 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.3%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings"; there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

SECTION 3 BULLISH SIGNALS

3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 12.2% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 5.1%.

- The earnings yield of 12.2% is 2.9 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.2%.

Earnings Yield   12.2   
Australian avg   5.1    
Dividend Yield   5.6    
Bond Yield       4.2    

Dividend Yield > Bond Yield of 4.15%:

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   5.56   
Bond Yield       4.15   
Spread           1.41   

The Dividend Yield of 5.6% is better than the Index average of 4.0%

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 5.6%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the All Ordinaries Index of 4.0% is 138.0%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

3.2 Other Bullish Signals

- Return on Equity of 13.7% versus sector average of 8.9% and market average of 10.9%.

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.3 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.1% in the last 3 years. This is better than the sector average of 6.0% and suggests a high margin of safety.

- As per the Du Pont analysis, Return on Equity of 13.7% is better than sector average of 8.9%. This is computed as net profit margin of 6.9% times asset turnover [sales/assets] of 1.1 times leverage factor [total assets/shareholders' equity] of 1.8.

4.3 P/E/G < 1

2020   137             

The stock is thinly traded. Liquidity has improved from 137 Days Untraded five years ago to 34 days in the past year.

4.7 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 8.2 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.5 is 4.2. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 12.2% is 2.9 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.2%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.3 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.2%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings"; there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

4.8 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

SECTION 3 BULLISH SIGNALS

3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 11.9% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 5%.

- The earnings yield of 11.9% is 2.9 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.1%.

(All figures in %)

Earnings Yield   11.9   
Australian avg   5      
Dividend Yield   5.4    
Bond Yield       4.1    

Dividend Yield > Bond Yield of 4.07%:

The dividend yield of 5.41% is 1.33 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.07%. The times factor of 1.33 is above the benchmark factor of 0.67 times set by Benjamin Graham.

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   5.41   
Bond Yield       4.07   
Spread           1.34   

The Dividend Yield of 5.4% is better than the Index average of 4.0%

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 5.4%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the All Ordinaries Index of 4.0% is 135.6%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

3.2 Other Bullish Signals

- Return on Equity of 13.7% versus sector average of 8.9% and market average of 10.8%.

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.3 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

- Return on Capital Employed of 14.3% versus sector average of 9.4% and market average of 3.8%.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.1% in the last 3 years. This is better than the sector average of 6.0% and suggests a high margin of safety.

- As per the Du Pont analysis, Return on Equity of 13.7% is better than sector average of 8.9%. This is computed as net profit margin of 6.9% times asset turnover [sales/assets] of 1.1 times leverage factor [total assets/shareholders' equity] of 1.8.

2023   11.0      10.0       
2022   10.0      42.9       

4.3 P/E/G < 1

The price earnings ratio of 8.4 divided by trailing twelve months eps growth of 10.0% corresponds to an attractive P/E/G of 0.8 times; being less than the value benchmark of 1.0.

EPS Growth (%)   10.0   
P/E/G            0.84

2021   84              
2020   137             

The stock is thinly traded. Liquidity has improved from 137 Days Untraded five years ago to 35 days in the past year.

4.7 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 8.4 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.5 is 4.4. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 11.9% is 2.9 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.1%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.3 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.1%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings"; there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

4.8 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

SECTION 3 BULLISH SIGNALS

3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 12.2% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 5%.

- The earnings yield of 12.2% is 3.0 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.1%.

(All figures in %)

Earnings Yield   12.2   
Australian avg   5      
Dividend Yield   5.6    
Bond Yield       4.1    

Dividend Yield > Bond Yield of 4.07%:

The dividend yield of 5.56% is 1.37 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.07%. The times factor of 1.37 is above the benchmark factor of 0.67 times set by Benjamin Graham.

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   5.56   
Bond Yield       4.07   
Spread           1.5    

The Dividend Yield of 5.6% is better than the Index average of 4.0%

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 5.6%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the All Ordinaries Index of 4.0% is 140.4%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

3.2 Other Bullish Signals

- Return on Equity of 13.7% versus sector average of 8.9% and market average of 10.8%.

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.3 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

- Return on Capital Employed of 14.3% versus sector average of 9.4% and market average of 3.8%.

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.3. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued and ranks in the top quartile of stocks by value of Q Ratio.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.1% in the last 3 years. This is better than the sector average of 6.0% and suggests a high margin of safety.

- As per the Du Pont analysis, Return on Equity of 13.7% is better than sector average of 8.9%. This is computed as net profit margin of 6.9% times asset turnover [sales/assets] of 1.1 times leverage factor [total assets/shareholders' equity] of 1.8.

2022   10.0      42.9       

4.3 P/E/G < 1

The price earnings ratio of 8.2 divided by trailing twelve months eps growth of 10.0% corresponds to an attractive P/E/G of 0.8 times; being less than the value benchmark of 1.0.

2020   138             

The stock is thinly traded. Liquidity has improved from 138 Days Untraded five years ago to 35 days in the past year.

4.7 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 8.2 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.5 is 4.2. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 12.2% is 3 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.1%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.1%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings"; there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

4.8 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 5.5%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the All Ordinaries Index of 4.0% is 139.4%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

3.2 Other Bullish Signals

- Return on Equity of 13.7% versus sector average of 8.9% and market average of 10.8%.

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.3 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

- Return on Assets of 7.4% versus sector average of 4.0% and market average of 1.9%.

- Return on Capital Employed of 14.3% versus sector average of 9.4% and market average of 3.8%.

MCap/Total Assets:

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.3. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued and ranks in the top quartile of stocks by value of Q Ratio.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.1% in the last 3 years. This is better than the sector average of 6.0% and suggests a high margin of safety.

- As per the Du Pont analysis, Return on Equity of 13.7% is better than sector average of 8.9%. This is computed as net profit margin of 6.9% times asset turnover [sales/assets] of 1.1 times leverage factor [total assets/shareholders' equity] of 1.8.

- The P/E of 8.2 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.5 is 4.2. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 12.2% is 2.9 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.1%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.3 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.1%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings"; there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

SECTION 3 BULLISH SIGNALS

3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 12.2% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 5%.

- The earnings yield of 12.2% is 3.0 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.1%.

(All figures in %)

Earnings Yield   12.2   
Australian avg   5      
Dividend Yield   5.6    
Bond Yield       4.1    

Dividend Yield > Bond Yield of 4.13%:

The dividend yield of 5.56% is 1.35 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.13%. The times factor of 1.35 is above the benchmark factor of 0.67 times set by Benjamin Graham.

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   5.56   
Bond Yield       4.13   
Spread           1.43   

The Dividend Yield of 5.6% is better than the Index average of 4.0%

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 5.6%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the All Ordinaries Index of 4.0% is 140.8%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

3.2 Other Bullish Signals

- Return on Equity of 13.7% versus sector average of 8.9% and market average of 10.8%.

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.3 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

- Return on Capital Employed of 14.3% versus sector average of 9.4% and market average of 3.8%.

MCap/Total Assets:

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.3. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued and ranks in the top quartile of stocks by value of Q Ratio.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.1% in the last 3 years. This is better than the sector average of 6.0% and suggests a high margin of safety.

- The P/E of 8.2 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.5 is 4.2. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 12.2% is 3 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.1%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.3 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.1%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings"; there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

SECTION 3 BULLISH SIGNALS

3.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 12.5% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 5%.

- The earnings yield of 12.5% is 3.0 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.1%.

(All figures in %)

Earnings Yield   12.5   
Australian avg   5      
Dividend Yield   5.7    
Bond Yield       4.1    

Dividend Yield > Bond Yield of 4.13%:

The dividend yield of 5.68% is 1.38 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.13%. The times factor of 1.38 is above the benchmark factor of 0.67 times set by Benjamin Graham.

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   5.68   
Bond Yield       4.13   
Spread           1.55   

The Dividend Yield of 5.7% is better than the Index average of 4.0%

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 5.7%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the All Ordinaries Index of 4.0% is 143.1%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

3.2 Other Bullish Signals

- Return on Equity of 13.7% versus sector average of 8.9% and market average of 10.8%.

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.3 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

- Return on Assets of 7.4% versus sector average of 4.0% and market average of 1.9%.

- Return on Capital Employed of 14.3% versus sector average of 9.4% and market average of 3.8%.

MCap/Total Assets:

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.3. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued and ranks in the top quartile of stocks by value of Q Ratio.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.1% in the last 3 years. This is better than the sector average of 6.0% and suggests a high margin of safety.

- As per the Du Pont analysis, Return on Equity of 13.7% is better than sector average of 8.9%. This is computed as net profit margin of 6.9% times asset turnover [sales/assets] of 1.1 times leverage factor [total assets/shareholders' equity] of 1.8.

2022   10.0      42.9       

4.3 P/E/G < 1

The price earnings ratio of 8.0 divided by trailing twelve months eps growth of 10.0% corresponds to an attractive P/E/G of 0.8 times; being less than the value benchmark of 1.0.

The stock is thinly traded. Liquidity has improved from 137 Days Untraded five years ago to 35 days in the past year.

4.7 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 8 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.5 is 4.0. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 12.5% is 3 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.1%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.1%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings"; there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

4.8 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

- Improvement in asset turnover.

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

2.7 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 7.9 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.5 is 3.9. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 12.6% is 3 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.2%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.2%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings"; there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

2.8 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

SECTION 1 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS

Price/Earnings of 7.9 < Capital Goods sector (of 69 stocks) avg of 27.7:

- The Price to Book of 0.5 indicates undervaluation compared with sector average of 6.2 and 2.9 for the Australian Market.

1.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

(All figures in %)

Earnings Yield   12.6   
Australian avg   5      
Dividend Yield   5.8

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   5.75

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

SECTION 1 BULLISH SIGNALS

1.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 12.2% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 5%.

- The earnings yield of 12.2% is 3.0 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.1%.

(All figures in %)

Earnings Yield   12.2   
Australian avg   5      
Dividend Yield   5.5    
Bond Yield       4.1    

Dividend Yield > Bond Yield of 4.08%:

The dividend yield of 5.52% is 1.35 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.08%. The times factor of 1.35 is above the benchmark factor of 0.67 times set by Benjamin Graham.

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   5.52   
Bond Yield       4.08   
Spread           1.44   

The Dividend Yield of 5.5% is better than the Index average of 4.0%

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 5.5%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the All Ordinaries Index of 4.0% is 139.4%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

1.2 Other Bullish Signals

- Return on Equity of 13.7% versus sector average of 8.9% and market average of 10.8%.

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.3 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

- Return on Capital Employed of 14.3% versus sector average of 9.4% and market average of 3.8%.

MCap/Total Assets:

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.3. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued and ranks in the top quartile of stocks by value of Q Ratio.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.1% in the last 3 years. This is better than the sector average of 6.0% and suggests a high margin of safety.

- As per the Du Pont analysis, Return on Equity of 13.7% is better than sector average of 8.9%. This is computed as net profit margin of 6.9% times asset turnover [sales/assets] of 1.1 times leverage factor [total assets/shareholders' equity] of 1.8.

The stock is thinly traded. Liquidity has improved from 135 Days Untraded five years ago to 36 days in the past year.

2.7 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 8.2 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.5 is 4.2. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 12.2% is 3 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.1%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.1%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings"; there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

2.8 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

Earnings Yield   12.2   
Australian avg   5      
Dividend Yield   5.5

The Dividend Yield of 5.5% is better than the Index average of 4.0%

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 5.5%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the All Ordinaries Index of 4.0% is 139.4%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

SECTION 1 BULLISH SIGNALS

1.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 12.0% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 4.9%.

- The earnings yield of 12.0% is 2.9 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.1%.

(All figures in %)

Earnings Yield   12.0   
Australian avg   4.9    
Dividend Yield   5.4    
Bond Yield       4.1    

Dividend Yield > Bond Yield of 4.09%:

The dividend yield of 5.43% is 1.33 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.09%. The times factor of 1.33 is above the benchmark factor of 0.67 times set by Benjamin Graham.

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   5.43   
Bond Yield       4.09   
Spread           1.34   

The Dividend Yield of 5.4% is better than the Index average of 4.0%

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 5.4%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the All Ordinaries Index of 4.0% is 137.5%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

1.2 Other Bullish Signals

- Return on Equity of 13.7% versus sector average of 8.9% and market average of 10.8%.

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.3 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

- Return on Capital Employed of 14.3% versus sector average of 9.4% and market average of 3.8%.

MCap/Total Assets:

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.3. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued and ranks in the top quartile of stocks by value of Q Ratio.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.1% in the last 3 years. This is better than the sector average of 6.0% and suggests a high margin of safety.

- As per the Du Pont analysis, Return on Equity of 13.7% is better than sector average of 8.9%. This is computed as net profit margin of 6.9% times asset turnover [sales/assets] of 1.1 times leverage factor [total assets/shareholders' equity] of 1.8.

The stock is thinly traded. Liquidity has improved from 135 Days Untraded five years ago to 36 days in the past year.

2.7 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 8.4 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.5 is 4.3. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 12% is 2.9 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.1%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.3 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.1%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings"; there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

2.8 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings";there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

THEME 1: BUY THE HIGHEST YIELDING STOCKS IN THE INDEX

Pg 65: The Dow 10 strategy, which calls for investors to buy the ten highest-yielding stocks in the Dow - Jones Industrial Average, has been regarded as one of the most successful investment strategies of all time. James Glassman of the Washington Post claimed that John Slatter, a Cleveland investment adviser and writer, invented the Dow 10 systems in the 1980s. The basic theory behind the Dow 10 strategy grounded in "value investing". Since firms reduce cash dividend payouts infrequently, stocks with a high dividend yield are often those that have fallen in price and are out of favor with investors.

Pg 67: Why has the Dow 10 strategy worked? There are two reasons: first, and most important, a value-based strategy based on a group of superior "survivor" firms; second, a high-dividend strategy.

Stocks for the Long Run by Jeremy J Siegel, McGraw Hill.

If investors are sure that the high yield will hold up, they'll buy the stock just for that. This will put a floor under the stock price. Blue chips with long records paying and raising dividends are the stocks people flock to in any sort of crisis.

- Earnings yield of 12.4% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 4.9%.

- The earnings yield of 12.4% is 3.1 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.0%.

Earnings Yield   12.4   
Australian avg   4.9    
Dividend Yield   5.6    
Bond Yield       4.0    

Dividend Yield > Bond Yield of 3.97%:

The dividend yield of 5.62% is 1.42 times the triple-A bond yield of 3.97%. The times factor of 1.42 is above the benchmark factor of 0.67 times set by Benjamin Graham.

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   5.62   
Bond Yield       3.97   
Spread           1.65   

The Dividend Yield of 5.6% is better than the Index average of 3.9%

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 5.6%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the All Ordinaries Index of 3.9% is 142.6%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

1.2 Other Bullish Signals

- Return on Equity of 13.7% versus sector average of 8.9% and market average of 10.8%.

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.3 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

- As per the Du Pont analysis, Return on Equity of 13.7% is better than sector average of 8.9%. This is computed as net profit margin of 6.9% times asset turnover [sales/assets] of 1.1 times leverage factor [total assets/shareholders' equity] of 1.8.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 4%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings"; there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- The P/E of 8.1 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.5 is 4.0. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 12.4% is 3.1 times the triple-A bond yield of 4%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 4%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings";there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].
