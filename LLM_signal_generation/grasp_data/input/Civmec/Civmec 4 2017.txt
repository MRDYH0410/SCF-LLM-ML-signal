4.15 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 8.2 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.5 is 4.3. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 12.2% is 2.7 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.3 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings";there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

4.16 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

SECTION 5 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS

Price/Earnings of 8 < Capital Goods sector (of 68 stocks) avg of 35.1:

4.15 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 8.2 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.5 is 4.3. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 12.2% is 2.7 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.5%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings";there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

4.16 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

4.15 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 8.3 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.5 is 4.4. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 12% is 2.8 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.3%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.3%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings";there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.4%.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings";there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

- The P/E of 8.2 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.5 is 4.3. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 12.2% is 2.8 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.3%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.3%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings";there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

- The P/E of 8.4 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.5 is 4.6. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 11.8% is 2.8 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.2%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.4 times the triple-A bond yield of 4.2%.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings";there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

2.16 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 8.1 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.1 is 8.8. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 12.3% is 3.9 times the triple-A bond yield of 3.2%.

- The P/E of 8.1 is 0.3 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 2 times the triple-A bond yield of 3.2%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).

2.17 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

- The P/E of 8.4 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.5 is 4.4. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 12% is 3 times the triple-A bond yield of 4%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings";there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

SECTION 1 THE PAST QUARTER: PRESS RELEASES

1.1 Press Releases and Corporate Wire

Press Release article 1 of 1, 52 words

March 25: Civmec announces dividend

Civmec today announced an interim dividend of 2.50c per share, franked to 100%. The ex-dividend date is Tuesday, March 26, 2024 and the record date is Wednesday, March 27, 2024 and it is payable on Monday, April 15.

SECTION 2 BULLISH SIGNALS

2.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 12.0% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 4.9%.

- The earnings yield of 12.0% is 3.0 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.0%.

(All figures in %)

Earnings Yield   12.0   
Australian avg   4.9    
Dividend Yield   6.0    
Bond Yield       4.0    

Dividend Yield > Bond Yield of 3.98%:

The dividend yield of 5.98% is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 3.98%. The times factor of 1.5 is above the benchmark factor of 0.67 times set by Benjamin Graham.

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   5.98   
Bond Yield       3.98   
Spread           2.0    

The Dividend Yield of 6% is better than the Index average of 4.2%

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 6%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the All Ordinaries Index of 4.2% is 143.4%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

2.2 Other Bullish Signals

- Return on Equity of 13.7% versus sector average of 7.9% and market average of 10.7%.

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.3 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

- Return on Assets of 7.4% versus sector average of 3.5% and market average of 1.9%.

- Return on Capital Employed of 14.3% versus sector average of 8.8% and market average of 3.5%.

MCap/Total Assets:

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.3. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued and ranks in the top quartile of stocks by value of Q Ratio.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.1% in the last 3 years. This is better than the sector average of 6.1% and suggests a high margin of safety.

- As per the Du Pont analysis, Return on Equity of 13.7% is better than sector average of 7.9%. This is computed as net profit margin of 6.9% times asset turnover [sales/assets] of 1.1 times leverage factor [total assets/shareholders' equity] of 1.8.

The stock is thinly traded. Liquidity has improved from 130 Days Untraded five years ago to 33 days in the past year.

3.7 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 8.4 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.5 is 4.4. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 12% is 3 times the triple-A bond yield of 4%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings"; there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

3.8 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

SECTION 3 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS

Price/Earnings of 8.4 < Capital Goods sector (of 68 stocks) avg of 37.0:

- The price-to-earnings ratio of 8.4 indicates undervaluation compared with sector average of 37.0 and market average of 20.6.

Australian avg   4.9    
Dividend Yield   5.9

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings";there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

- The P/E of 8.1 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.1 is 8.8. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 12.3% is 3.9 times the triple-A bond yield of 3.2%.

- The P/E of 8.1 is 0.3 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 2 times the triple-A bond yield of 3.2%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).

2.17 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

- The P/E of 8.4 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.5 is 4.4. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 12% is 3 times the triple-A bond yield of 4%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings";there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

1.1 Press Releases and Corporate Wire

Press Release article 1 of 1, 52 words

March 25: Civmec announces dividend

Civmec today announced an interim dividend of 2.50c per share, franked to 100%. The ex-dividend date is Tuesday, March 26, 2024 and the record date is Wednesday, March 27, 2024 and it is payable on Monday, April 15.

SECTION 2 BULLISH SIGNALS

2.1 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 12.0% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 4.9%.

- The earnings yield of 12.0% is 3.0 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.0%.

(All figures in %)

Earnings Yield   12.0   
Australian avg   4.9    
Dividend Yield   6.0    
Bond Yield       4.0    

Dividend Yield > Bond Yield of 3.98%:

The dividend yield of 5.98% is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 3.98%. The times factor of 1.5 is above the benchmark factor of 0.67 times set by Benjamin Graham.

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   5.98   
Bond Yield       3.98   
Spread           2.0    

The Dividend Yield of 6% is better than the Index average of 4.2%

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 6%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the All Ordinaries Index of 4.2% is 143.4%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

2.2 Other Bullish Signals

- Return on Equity of 13.7% versus sector average of 7.9% and market average of 10.7%.

- Total Liabilities/EBITDA of 4.3 is less than 5, this compares favourably with the Joseph Piotroski benchmark of 5.

- Return on Assets of 7.4% versus sector average of 3.5% and market average of 1.9%.

- Return on Capital Employed of 14.3% versus sector average of 8.8% and market average of 3.5%.

MCap/Total Assets:

- Tobin's Q Ratio, defined as MCap divided by Total Assets, is 0.3. Compared with the rest of the market the stock is undervalued and ranks in the top quartile of stocks by value of Q Ratio.

- Net profit margin has averaged 6.1% in the last 3 years. This is better than the sector average of 6.1% and suggests a high margin of safety.

- As per the Du Pont analysis, Return on Equity of 13.7% is better than sector average of 7.9%. This is computed as net profit margin of 6.9% times asset turnover [sales/assets] of 1.1 times leverage factor [total assets/shareholders' equity] of 1.8.

The stock is thinly traded. Liquidity has improved from 130 Days Untraded five years ago to 33 days in the past year.

3.7 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 8.4 multiplied by the P/NTA of 0.5 is 4.4. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 12% is 3 times the triple-A bond yield of 4%.

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.5 times the triple-A bond yield of 4%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).-"Earnings growth over the most recent ten years of 7% compounded - that is a doubling of earnings in a five-year period"; the earnings per share have more than doubled in the last 5 years.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings"; there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

3.8 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].
