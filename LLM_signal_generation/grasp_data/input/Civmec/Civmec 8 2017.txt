As of yesterday's market close, IAG shares were trading at $7.46 AUD, just shy of their 52-week high of $7.56 AUD reached on August 25th. This marks a significant increase from the company's 52-week low of $5.40 AUD on October 10th, 2023. Looking at the charts, IAG has been trending upwards since mid-June, with a steady climb that has gained momentum over the past few weeks. This bullish run has pushed the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) to 68.64, indicating that it may be approaching overbought territory. However, with strong financials and a solid track record, investors may be willing to pay a premium for IAG shares.

Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio): 2.56025 IAG's P/B ratio is 2.56025, which is slightly lower than the industry average of 2.74. While this may indicate that the company's stock is slightly undervalued compared to its peers, it also reflects the fact that IAG has a strong balance sheet with low debt and high cash reserves. Dividend and Share Buyback: On August 21st, IAG announced plans to increase its dividend and launch a share buyback program worth up to AU$350 million. This move is expected to further boost investor confidence and drive up demand for the company's shares.

3.18 Satisfies five criteria of Benjamin Graham

- The P/E of 9.6 multiplied by the P/NTA of 1.3 is 12.3. Being less than the Benjamin Graham benchmark of 22.5 the stock appears undervalued.

- "An earnings-to-price yield of at least twice the triple-A bond"; the stock's earning yield of 10.4% is 3.9 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.7%.

- The P/E of 9.6 is 0.3 times the highest average P/E of 32.4 in the last five years. This is a value criterion, according to Benjamin Graham who described as a value criterion "A P/E ratio down to less than four-tenth of the highest average P/E ratio the stock attained in the most recent five years".

- "A dividend yield of at least two-thirds the triple-A bond yield"; the stock's dividend yield is 1.9 times the triple-A bond yield of 2.7%.

-"Total debt less than tangible book value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is less than tangible book value of AUD420.6 million (US$279 million).-"Total debt equal or less than twice the net quick liquidation value"; total debt of AUD66.7 million (US$44.2 million) is 0.3 times the net liquidation value of AUD214.3 million (US$142.1 million).

3.19 Satisfies 6 out of 9 criteria of Joseph Piotroski [pass mark 5]:

- Positive net income.

- Positive operating cashflow.

- Return on Assets improvement [from 7% to 7.4%].

- Good quality of earnings [operating cashflow exceeds net income].

- Improvement in current ratio from 1.2 to 1.4.

- Improvement in gross margin [from 11.2% to 13.1%].

But does not meet the following 3 criteria of Joseph Piotroski:

- Improvement in long-term debt to total assets.

- Total shares on issue unchanged (or reduction in total shares on issue).

- Improvement in asset turnover.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

If you are in a position to donate, please consider donating generously.

SECTION 2 BULLISH SIGNALS

2.1 Price/Earnings of 10.4 < Capital Goods sector (of 67 stocks) avg of 35.5:

- The price-to-earnings ratio of 10.4 indicates undervaluation compared with sector average of 35.5 and market average of 26.6.

Price to Book of 0.7 < Capital Goods sector (of 67 stocks) average of 7.3:

- The Price to Book of 0.7 indicates undervaluation compared with sector average of 7.3 and 3.1 for the Australian Market.

2.2 Relative Value Indicators: Undervaluation compared with Index averages and bond yield

- Earnings yield of 9.6% is more attractive compared with the Australian average earning yield of 3.8%.

- The earnings yield of 9.6% is 2.4 times the 10-year bond yield of 4.0%.

(All figures in %)

Earnings Yield   9.6   
Australian avg   3.8   
Dividend Yield   4.8   
Bond Yield       4.0   

Dividend Yield > Bond Yield of 3.98%:

The dividend yield of 4.78% is 1.2 times the triple-A bond yield of 3.98%. The times factor of 1.2 is above the benchmark factor of 0.67 times set by Benjamin Graham.

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   4.78   
Bond Yield       3.98   
Spread           0.8    

The Dividend Yield of 4.8% is better than the Index average of 3.7%

- The relative yield of the stock, defined by its yield of 4.8%, divided by average yield of dividend yielding stocks in the All Ordinaries Index of 3.7% is 128.5%. This suggests the stock is undervalued in dividend yield terms.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

SECTION 4 TODAY'S BULLISH SIGNALS

Price/Earnings of 10.4 < Capital Goods sector (of 67 stocks) avg of 35.5:

- The price-to-earnings ratio of 10.4 indicates undervaluation compared with sector average of 35.5 and market average of 26.6.

Price to Book of 0.7 < Capital Goods sector (of 67 stocks) average of 7.3:

- The Price to Book of 0.7 indicates undervaluation compared with sector average of 7.3 and 3.1 for the Australian Market.

Australian avg   3.8   
Dividend Yield   4.8   
Bond Yield       4.0   

Dividend Yield > Bond Yield of 3.98%:

(All figures in %)

Dividend Yield   4.78

1.            Notes to the condensed interim consolidated financial statements
1 Company information

Civmec Limited (the 'Company') is incorporated and domiciled in Singapore and
its shares are publicly traded on the Singapore Exchange and the Australian
Stock Exchange. These condensed interim consolidated financial statements as
at and for the six months ended 30 June 2024 comprise the Company and its
subsidiaries (collectively, the Group). The primary activity of the Company is
that of an investment holding company.

The principal activities of the Group include heavy engineering, shipbuilding,
modularisation, SMP (structural, mechanical, piping), EIC (electrical,
instrumentation and control), precast concrete, site civil works, industrial
insulation, maintenance, surface treatment, refractory and access solutions.

Pending change of domicile of the head company of the Group

On 27 October 2023, the Company has entered into an implementation agreement
with Civmec Australia Limited (the 'NewCo') with the intention to change the
domicile of the head company of the Group from the Company (domiciled in
Singapore) to the NewCo (domiciled in Australia). The Change of Domicile will
be achieved through a restructuring of the Company by way of a scheme of
arrangement in accordance with Section 210 of the Companies Act 1967 of
Singapore.

Shareholders voted to approve the Scheme at a meeting held on 1 August 2024
and the Shareholders' Scheme has been sanctioned by the Court on 28 August
2024.

2 Basis of preparation

The condensed interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 June
2024 have been prepared in accordance with SFRS(I) 1-34Interim Financial
Reporting issued by the Accounting Standards Council Singapore. The condensed
interim financial statements do not include all the information required for a
complete set of financial statements. However, selected explanatory notes are
included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an
understanding of the changes in the Group's financial position and performance
of the Group since the last interim financial statements for the period ended
31 December 2023.

The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous
financial year which were prepared in accordance with SFRS(I)s, except for the
adoption of new and amended standards as set out in Note 2.1.

The condensed interim financial statements are presented in Australia dollars
(AUD or A$), which is the functional currency of the Company. All financial
information presented in Australia dollars have been rounded to the nearest
thousand, unless otherwise stated.

2.1 New and amended standards adopted by the Group

A number of amendments to Standards have become applicable for the current
reporting period. The Group did not have to change its accounting policies or
make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting those standards.

1.            Notes to the condensed interim consolidated financial statements
          (continued)
2 Basis of preparation (continued)

2.2 Use of judgements and estimates

The preparation of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements
requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect
the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on
historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of
making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates.

The significant judgements made by management in applying the Group's
accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the
same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements as at and
for the year ended 30 June 2023.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the
estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
1.            Critical judgements in applying the Group's accounting policies
Information about critical judgements in applying accounting policies that
have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial
statements is included in the following notes:

Impairment of trade and other receivables and contract assets

The Group applies the simplified approach to provide for the ECL ('Expected
Credit Losses') for all trade receivables and contract assets at an amount
equal to the lifetime ECL. ECLs are a probability weighted estimate (based on
the Group's historical experience) measured as the present value of all cash
shortfalls on default financial assets considering both quantitative and
qualitative information and analysis. Factors considered in individual
assessment are geographical regions, payment history, past due status and
term.

Construction contract revenue

Construction contract revenue is recognised over time by reference to the
Group's progress towards completion of the contract. The measure of progress
is determined based on the proportion of contract costs incurred to date to
the estimated total contract costs ('input method'). Costs incurred that are
not related to the contract or that do not contribute towards satisfying a
performance obligation ('PO') are excluded from the measure of progress and
instead are expensed as incurred.

Construction contract revenue comprises the initial amount of revenue agreed
in the contract and variations in contract work to the extent that is highly
probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue
will not occur.

In estimating the variable consideration for contract revenue, the Group uses
the expected value amount method to estimate the transaction price. The
expected value is the sum of probability-weighted amounts in a range of
possible consideration amounts. Management has relied on historical experience
and the work of experts, analysed by customers and nature of scope of work,
from prior years.

Management has exercised judgement in applying the constraint on the estimated
variable consideration that can be included in the transaction price. For
variations claims, management has determined that a portion of the estimated
variable consideration is subject to the constraint as, based on past
experience with the customers, it is highly probable that a significant
reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognised will occur, and
therefore will not be recognised as revenue.

Civmec Limited - Civmec delivers A$1 billion revenue and A$121 million EBITDA in FY24 - Public Technologies

{{20240829T110331.000+0000}}Civmec has today released financial results for FY24, delivering record
revenue and profits together with a stronger balance sheet.
Key financial metrics compared to the previous financial year are set out in
the table below:

Chairman James Fitzgerald said: "It is pleasing to deliver another record
result for our shareholders, with the Group achieving over A$1 billion in
revenue and A$64 million in NPAT. This continued strong performance has
allowed us to propose a final dividend of A$0.035, taking total dividends
payable for the year to A$0.06, a 20% increase on FY23. As in the past, the
dividends are fully franked for Australian taxpayers. As recently announced,
the resolution to change the domicile of the parent entity of the Group to be
Australian was passed at the Shareholders' scheme meeting on 1 August 2024.
The change in domicile of the Group will broaden the future opportunities that
will align with Civmec's strategic growth plans."

Operational Update          
      Following record revenues of $1.0 billion and EBITDA of $120.8 million,
Civmec generated cash from operations of $96.9 million, representing an 80%
conversion rate and resulted in a year-end net cash position of $24.5 million
(gross cash position of $88.5 million).

New Civmec Facilities - Pilbara and Gladstone Expansion          
      The Group is pleased to announce that its new maintenance facility in
Port Hedland is now completed and operational and Civmec has commenced
delivering maintenance work out of the facility for local clients. This marks
a significant milestone in our ongoing efforts to enhance our Pilbara focussed
maintenance service capabilities.

In addition to this, Civmec has successfully purchased an established
adjoining workshop next to Civmec's land in Gladstone, Central Queensland.
This acquisition has expedited the company's goal to establish a permanent
base of operations in the region. Civmec has already moved into the newly
acquired facility, enabling us to increase our service offering in the region.

Manufacturing and Maintenance Awards          
      Civmec's maintenance and capital works segments saw continued growth
during the year, with new agreements and contract extensions awarded during Q4
FY24 including:
      â¢ A three-year umbrella works contract with NCIG for maintenance works
on their infrastructure.
      â¢ A contract for fabrication and pre-assembly works associated with
the Gorgon CO2 Long term optimisation project.
      â¢ A contract for the fabrication and assembly of the SL1A Shiploader
for Dalrymple Bay Infrastructure.
      â¢ A notification of preferred contractor for award relating to the
design and supply of a bridge reclaimer with an established long-term client.
      â¢ A letter of intent from Orora for glass furnace maintenance and
rebuild works in South Australia.

Order Book          
      Tendering activity continues to be strong across all sectors, with the
Group focused on securing projects that will allow it to grow its workforce
and revenue at a sustainable pace. Opportunities remain plentiful for Civmec
to keep replenishing its order book, which amounted to over A$853 million as
of 30 June 2024.

The Group has continued to grow its engineering design capability with an
understanding that there is strong demand for Original Equipment Manufacturer
(OEM) material handling machines, for both new facilities and replacement of
aging assets. On a conservative analysis of the OEM materials handling market,
there is demand for more than 30 machines over the next 10 years in Australia.
Presently Civmec is the only Australian company with a full in-house service
offering covering the life-cycle of materials handling balance machines.

In addition to this, Civmec is committed to supporting future shipbuilding
programs in the defence sector and is presently working towards formalising
the previously announced MOU for a strategic joint venture to tender on the
LAND8710 landing craft heavy shipbuilding program for the Commonwealth of
Australia, and opens the opportunity for Civmec to potentially participate in
over A$25 billion of future works.

Chief Executive Officer Patrick Tallon said: "As we celebrate 15 years of
successful operations in Australia, the Group's outstanding financial
performance and ability to deliver over A$1 billion in revenue this year is a
testament to our Group's operational excellence. As we celebrate the past 15
years of success, we remain focused on our long-term growth strategy."

Appointment of new Chief Financial Officer          
      The Board is pleased to announce an addition to our Executive team with
the appointment of Mr Bojan Cica as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) effective
from 1 September 2024.

Mr Cica, who joined Civmec in 2019, most recently served as the Group Manager
Commercial and Operational Risk. His exceptional performance in these roles
has been integral to the Civmec's continued success. His comprehensive
understanding of the business will significantly benefit his new position as
CFO. He succeeds Mr Kevin Deery, who has commendably fulfilled the CFO duties
in an acting capacity alongside his responsibilities as Chief Operating
Officer for several years. Mr Deery has mentored and worked alongside Mr Cica
in advance of this succession for some time, offering extensive guidance to
ensure a smooth transition.

Mr Cica holds a Master of Business Administration and a Bachelor of Laws.

Australian Re-Domicile Update          
      In light of Civmec's operations and workforce being entirely based in
Australia, Civmec announced on 27 October 2023 the proposed change of domicile
for the Group's head company from Civmec Limited (domiciled in Singapore) to
Civmec Australia Limited (domiciled in Australia). This change of domicile
will be accomplished through a restructuring of the Group by means of a scheme
of arrangement. This strategic move is designed to better align Civmec with
local manufacturing requirements, thereby enhancing the number of
opportunities available to the company.

Civmec is pleased to announce that the resolution to re-domicile Group's
parent company was passed at the Shareholder Scheme meeting on 1 August 2024
and the Shareholders' Scheme has been sanctioned by the Court on 28 August
2024. The Company will lodge the Court Order on the 4 September 2024 with the
Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority of Singapore and the scheme will
take effect on and from the date of lodgement.

ESG Activities          
          Supporting Community          
      For the 6th consecutive year, Pat Tallon (CEO) entered the Vinnies CEO
Sleepout, joined by Mylon Manusiu (EGM), raising over A$150,000, making Civmec
WA's highest overall contributor.

Reconciliation          
      NAIDOC week was celebrated with First Nation employees, suppliers,
clients, and state and local government representatives attending the release
of our special video animation of the Walyalup Dreaming story. View video -
The Walyalup Dreamtime Story here (https://youtu.be/D5bnV-VFWP8).

Workforce Development          
      During FY24, Civmec employed 146 apprentices, graduates, and trainees,
marking a significant investment in the future workforce. Additionally, for
the first time, over 10% of the workforce comprises women with a continued
50/50 split in corporate roles reflecting Civmec's commitment to diversity and
inclusion.

Climate Change          
      Civmec has set a near-term target for greater than 50% reduction in
Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (from 2022 levels).

Summary of the latest news for Civmec

Title: Civmec's Strong Order Book Boosts Investor Confidence Date: August 25, 2024 Perth-based engineering firm Civmec (ASX: CIV) has been making waves in the industry with its impressive order book and strong financial performance. Despite the lack of recent news, investors remain optimistic about the company's future prospects. A review of Civmec's historical stock prices reveals a steady upward trend over the past year. The company's shares have consistently traded above their 52-week low of $0.87 AUD, reaching a high of $1.05 AUD on October 31st, 2023. This represents a significant increase of 22% from its 52-week low. Moreover, Civmec's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 8.51614, indicating that investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of the company's earnings. Similarly, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.1907 suggests that the market values the company's assets at a higher level than its net worth. These ratios suggest that investors have faith in Civmec's ability to continue delivering strong financial performance. The company's solid order book, which includes multiple contracts worth A$174 million, further reinforces this confidence. In conclusion, while there may be no immediate news driving Civmec's share price, the company's fundamentals and long-term growth potential make it an attractive investment opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the strength of the Australian engineering sector.

Here is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:

- Treasury Wine Estates (TWE.AX) traded up 1.02 % and now trades at AUD 11.59. Treasury Wine Estates has a market capitalisation of AUD 9.6 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Treasury Wine Estates is 38.52. Treasury Wine Estates Limited (ASX: TWE) has been quiet in recent times, with no significant news updates since August 15th. However, a look into the company's financial performance paints an interesting picture. According to the latest available data, Treasury Wine Estates reported its full-year results on August 15th, with a last closing price of AUD 11.9. While this may seem like a modest increase compared to the previous year, the company's 52-week high of AUD 13.01 on April 3rd suggests that there may be room for growth. Moreover, the company's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) stands at 38.5244, indicating that investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of earnings. This could be due to the company's strong fundamentals, including its impressive track record of revenue growth and solid balance sheet. In terms of valuation, Treasury Wine Estates trades at a price-to-book ratio (P/B Ratio) of 2.08317, which is slightly above the industry average. This suggests that the market is currently undervaluing the company's assets and future growth potential. Overall, while there may not be any immediate catalysts driving the stock's performance, Treasury Wine Estates appears to be well-positioned for long-term growth based on its historical financials and valuations. Savvy investors may want to keep a close eye on this Australian wine giant as it continues to navigate the competitive landscape.

- Macquarie (MQG.AX) traded down -0.51 % and now trades at AUD 213.03. Macquarie has a market capitalisation of AUD 78 bn. Macquarie has a current price to earnings ratio of 22.28. In their latest disclosure document, Macquarie Bank Limited revealed that their risk-weighted assets (RWA) stood at $48.3 billion as of June 2024. This represents a decrease from the previous month, primarily due to a reduction in credit risk. The bank's credit risk measurement remains robust, with a provision coverage ratio of 74%, indicating a strong ability to cover potential loan losses. Additionally, the bank's leverage ratio stands at 4.8%, well above the regulatory requirement of 3%. Macquarie Bank continues to maintain a strong liquidity position, with a liquidity coverage ratio of 130%. The bank's securitization exposure remains low, at $1.4 billion, or less than 3% of RWA. Overall, Macquarie Bank's capital position remains solid, with a common equity tier 1 ratio of 10.6% and a total capital ratio of 14.4%.

- Qantas Airways (QAN.AX) traded up 0.32 % and now trades at AUD 6.3. Current market capitalisation for Qantas Airways is AUD 9.6 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Qantas Airways is 6.39. Airline Stock Soars: Qantas Airways (OTCMKTS:QUBSF) Sees Significant Growth Investors looking for a profitable airline stock may want to take notice of Qantas Airways (OTCMKTS:QUBSF), which has seen significant growth over the past year. As of August 23rd, the last closing price of Qantas Airways was 6.22 AUD, up 1.5% from the previous day's trading. This marks a notable increase compared to the same time last year, when the stock was trading at around 4.67 AUD. Technical Analysis: Bullish Momentum Looking at the technical side of things, Qantas Airways is currently experiencing bullish momentum, with its 52-week high sitting at 18.4 AUD on December 25th, 2023. This represents a gain of over 200% from its 52-week low of 4.67 AUD on October 19th, 2023. The relative strength index (RSI) is currently at 63.62, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, providing a neutral outlook. Price to Earnings Ratio and Price to Book Ratio One important metric to consider when evaluating Qantas Airways is its price to earnings ratio (P/E ratio). Currently, the P/E ratio stands at 6.39496, suggesting that investors are paying approximately 6.4 times the company's earnings per share. Additionally, the price to book ratio is 88.7499, meaning that investors are paying roughly 89 times the company's book value per share. Outlook and Conclusion Overall, Qantas Airways appears to be a promising investment opportunity, with strong bullish momentum and a favorable outlook. While the stock's P/E ratio and price to book ratio may seem elevated, the company's impressive growth over the past year suggests that these ratios may be justified. Investors considering adding Qantas Airways to their portfolio should keep an eye on future developments and financial reports to confirm this trend continues.

- Origin Energy (ORG.AX) traded up 0.81 % and now trades at AUD 9.96. Current market capitalisation for Origin Energy is AUD 17.1 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Origin Energy is 12.41. Origin Energy's Strong Fundamentals Point to Promising Future Investors looking for a solid investment opportunity may want to take a closer look at Origin Energy Limited (OTCMKTS: OGFGY), which has shown consistent growth and strong fundamentals despite the lack of recent news. According to the latest data available, the company's last known news was announced on August 17th, with a dividend increase of $0.15 per share. This move highlights the company's commitment to rewarding shareholders while also reinforcing its financial strength. A Technical Analysis Perspective From a technical analysis perspective, Origin Energy's performance over the past year has been impressive, with the stock reaching a 52-week high of $11.06 AUD on June 27th, 2024. Although the stock has since retreated slightly, it remains well above its 52-week low of $7.77 AUD on December 10th, 2023. This suggests that the company's long-term upward trend remains intact, and investors may be wise to consider taking advantage of any dips in the stock's value. Key Metrics and Ratios Some key metrics and ratios provide further insight into Origin Energy's financial health and potential for future growth. For example, the company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio currently stands at 12.4105, indicating that investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of earnings. Similarly, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.82294 suggests that the company's shares are undervalued compared to their intrinsic worth. These ratios suggest that Origin Energy is a highly profitable and undervalued investment opportunity. Conclusion While there have been no recent news updates on Origin Energy, the company's strong fundamentals and technical indicators suggest that it remains a promising investment opportunity. With a history of consistently increasing dividends and a commitment to rewarding shareholders, Origin Energy appears poised for continued success in the months and years ahead. As such, investors may want to keep a close eye on this stock and consider taking advantage of any opportunities to invest in the company at a discount.

- Brambles (BXB.AX) traded down -0.95 % and now trades at AUD 17.6. Brambles has a market capitalisation of AUD 21.5 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Brambles is 20.65. Title: Technical Analysis: Brambles' Share Price Hits 52-Week High, But Is It Overvalued? Introduction: Investors may be wondering whether now is the right time to buy into Brambles Limited (OTCMKTS:BXBLY), after the company's share price hit a 52-week high of $18.27 AUD earlier this month. However, some analysts are questioning whether the stock has become overvalued, given its relatively high price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-book ratio. In this article, we will examine the current state of Brambles' financial health and assess whether the company's shares are worth investing in. Financial Health Check: According to our analysis, Brambles' latest closing price of $18.04 AUD represents a significant increase compared to its 52-week low of $12.70 AUD, which suggests that the company may be experiencing a period of strong growth. Additionally, the company's price-to-earnings ratio of 20.6516 and price-to-book ratio of 4.66161 indicate that investors are willing to pay a premium for Brambles' shares, based on their expectations of future performance. However, some analysts have expressed concerns that Brambles' share price may have become overvalued, particularly when considering the company's relatively modest earnings growth. While Brambles' revenue has been increasing steadily over the past year, its net income has remained largely flat, which could suggest that the company's valuation is not entirely justified by its financial fundamentals. Technical Outlook: From a technical standpoint, Brambles' share price appears to be trending upwards, with a series of higher highs and higher lows over the past several months. This bullish pattern suggests that investor sentiment remains positive towards the company, despite some concerns about overvaluation. However, if Brambles' share price were to fall below its 50-day moving average of $16.85 AUD, it could signal a potential reversal in investor sentiment and potentially lead to a correction in the company's share value. Conclusion: While Brambles' share price has reached a 52-week high and investors remain optimistic about the company's future prospects, some analysts have raised concerns about overvaluation. As such, investors may wish to exercise caution before buying into Brambles' shares, particularly if they are looking for a more undervalued opportunity. Nevertheless, for those who believe in the long-term potential of the company, Brambles' current share price may still represent a compelling entry point for investment.

Page | 7
1.            Notes to the condensed interim consolidated financial statements
1 Company information

Civmec Limited (the 'Company') is incorporated and domiciled in Singapore and
its shares are publicly traded on the Singapore Exchange and the Australian
Stock Exchange. These condensed interim consolidated financial statements as
at and for the six months ended 30 June 2024 comprise the Company and its
subsidiaries (collectively, the Group). The primary activity of the Company is
that of an investment holding company.

The principal activities of the Group include heavy engineering, shipbuilding,
modularisation, SMP (structural, mechanical, piping), EIC (electrical,
instrumentation and control), precast concrete, site civil works, industrial
insulation, maintenance, surface treatment, refractory and access solutions.

Pending change of domicile of the head company of the Group

On 27 October 2023, the Company has entered into an implementation agreement
with Civmec Australia Limited (the 'NewCo') with the intention to change the
domicile of the head company of the Group from the Company (domiciled in
Singapore) to the NewCo (domiciled in Australia). The Change of Domicile will
be achieved through a restructuring of the Company by way of a scheme of
arrangement in accordance with Section 210 of the Companies Act 1967 of
Singapore.

Shareholders voted to approve the Scheme at a meeting held on 1 August 2024
and the Shareholders' Scheme has been sanctioned by the Court on 28 August
2024.

2 Basis of preparation

The condensed interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 June
2024 have been prepared in accordance with SFRS(I) 1-34Interim Financial
Reporting issued by the Accounting Standards Council Singapore. The condensed
interim financial statements do not include all the information required for a
complete set of financial statements. However, selected explanatory notes are
included to explain events and transactions that are significant to an
understanding of the changes in the Group's financial position and performance
of the Group since the last interim financial statements for the period ended
31 December 2023.

The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous
financial year which were prepared in accordance with SFRS(I)s, except for the
adoption of new and amended standards as set out in Note 2.1.

The condensed interim financial statements are presented in Australia dollars
(AUD or A$), which is the functional currency of the Company. All financial
information presented in Australia dollars have been rounded to the nearest
thousand, unless otherwise stated.

2.1 New and amended standards adopted by the Group

A number of amendments to Standards have become applicable for the current
reporting period. The Group did not have to change its accounting policies or
make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting those standards.

          (continued)
2 Basis of preparation (continued)

2.2 Use of judgements and estimates

The preparation of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements
requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect
the application of policies and reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on
historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of
making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these
estimates.

The significant judgements made by management in applying the Group's
accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the
same as those that applied to the consolidated financial statements as at and
for the year ended 30 June 2023.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the
estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
1.            Critical judgements in applying the Group's accounting policies
Information about critical judgements in applying accounting policies that
have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial
statements is included in the following notes:

Impairment of trade and other receivables and contract assets

The Group applies the simplified approach to provide for the ECL ('Expected
Credit Losses') for all trade receivables and contract assets at an amount
equal to the lifetime ECL. ECLs are a probability weighted estimate (based on
the Group's historical experience) measured as the present value of all cash
shortfalls on default financial assets considering both quantitative and
qualitative information and analysis. Factors considered in individual
assessment are geographical regions, payment history, past due status and
term.

Construction contract revenue

Construction contract revenue is recognised over time by reference to the
Group's progress towards completion of the contract. The measure of progress
is determined based on the proportion of contract costs incurred to date to
the estimated total contract costs ('input method'). Costs incurred that are
not related to the contract or that do not contribute towards satisfying a
performance obligation ('PO') are excluded from the measure of progress and
instead are expensed as incurred.

Construction contract revenue comprises the initial amount of revenue agreed
in the contract and variations in contract work to the extent that is highly
probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue
will not occur.

In estimating the variable consideration for contract revenue, the Group uses
the expected value amount method to estimate the transaction price. The
expected value is the sum of probability-weighted amounts in a range of
possible consideration amounts. Management has relied on historical experience
and the work of experts, analysed by customers and nature of scope of work,
from prior years.

Management has exercised judgement in applying the constraint on the estimated
variable consideration that can be included in the transaction price. For
variations claims, management has determined that a portion of the estimated
variable consideration is subject to the constraint as, based on past
experience with the customers, it is highly probable that a significant
reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognised will occur, and
therefore will not be recognised as revenue.

Civmec Limited - Civmec delivers A$1 billion revenue and A$121 million EBITDA in FY24 - Public Technologies

{{20240829T110331.000+0000}}Civmec has today released financial results for FY24, delivering record
revenue and profits together with a stronger balance sheet.
Key financial metrics compared to the previous financial year are set out in
the table below:

Chairman James Fitzgerald said: "It is pleasing to deliver another record
result for our shareholders, with the Group achieving over A$1 billion in
revenue and A$64 million in NPAT. This continued strong performance has
allowed us to propose a final dividend of A$0.035, taking total dividends
payable for the year to A$0.06, a 20% increase on FY23. As in the past, the
dividends are fully franked for Australian taxpayers. As recently announced,
the resolution to change the domicile of the parent entity of the Group to be
Australian was passed at the Shareholders' scheme meeting on 1 August 2024.
The change in domicile of the Group will broaden the future opportunities that
will align with Civmec's strategic growth plans."

Operational Update          
      Following record revenues of $1.0 billion and EBITDA of $120.8 million,
Civmec generated cash from operations of $96.9 million, representing an 80%
conversion rate and resulted in a year-end net cash position of $24.5 million
(gross cash position of $88.5 million).

New Civmec Facilities - Pilbara and Gladstone Expansion          
      The Group is pleased to announce that its new maintenance facility in
Port Hedland is now completed and operational and Civmec has commenced
delivering maintenance work out of the facility for local clients. This marks
a significant milestone in our ongoing efforts to enhance our Pilbara focussed
maintenance service capabilities.

In addition to this, Civmec has successfully purchased an established
adjoining workshop next to Civmec's land in Gladstone, Central Queensland.
This acquisition has expedited the company's goal to establish a permanent
base of operations in the region. Civmec has already moved into the newly
acquired facility, enabling us to increase our service offering in the region.

Manufacturing and Maintenance Awards          
      Civmec's maintenance and capital works segments saw continued growth
during the year, with new agreements and contract extensions awarded during Q4
FY24 including:
      â¢ A three-year umbrella works contract with NCIG for maintenance works
on their infrastructure.
      â¢ A contract for fabrication and pre-assembly works associated with
the Gorgon CO2 Long term optimisation project.
      â¢ A contract for the fabrication and assembly of the SL1A Shiploader
for Dalrymple Bay Infrastructure.
      â¢ A notification of preferred contractor for award relating to the
design and supply of a bridge reclaimer with an established long-term client.
      â¢ A letter of intent from Orora for glass furnace maintenance and
rebuild works in South Australia.

Order Book          
      Tendering activity continues to be strong across all sectors, with the
Group focused on securing projects that will allow it to grow its workforce
and revenue at a sustainable pace. Opportunities remain plentiful for Civmec
to keep replenishing its order book, which amounted to over A$853 million as
of 30 June 2024.

The Group has continued to grow its engineering design capability with an
understanding that there is strong demand for Original Equipment Manufacturer
(OEM) material handling machines, for both new facilities and replacement of
aging assets. On a conservative analysis of the OEM materials handling market,
there is demand for more than 30 machines over the next 10 years in Australia.
Presently Civmec is the only Australian company with a full in-house service
offering covering the life-cycle of materials handling balance machines.

In addition to this, Civmec is committed to supporting future shipbuilding
programs in the defence sector and is presently working towards formalising
the previously announced MOU for a strategic joint venture to tender on the
LAND8710 landing craft heavy shipbuilding program for the Commonwealth of
Australia, and opens the opportunity for Civmec to potentially participate in
over A$25 billion of future works.

Chief Executive Officer Patrick Tallon said: "As we celebrate 15 years of
successful operations in Australia, the Group's outstanding financial
performance and ability to deliver over A$1 billion in revenue this year is a
testament to our Group's operational excellence. As we celebrate the past 15
years of success, we remain focused on our long-term growth strategy."

Appointment of new Chief Financial Officer          
      The Board is pleased to announce an addition to our Executive team with
the appointment of Mr Bojan Cica as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) effective
from 1 September 2024.

Mr Cica, who joined Civmec in 2019, most recently served as the Group Manager
Commercial and Operational Risk. His exceptional performance in these roles
has been integral to the Civmec's continued success. His comprehensive
understanding of the business will significantly benefit his new position as
CFO. He succeeds Mr Kevin Deery, who has commendably fulfilled the CFO duties
in an acting capacity alongside his responsibilities as Chief Operating
Officer for several years. Mr Deery has mentored and worked alongside Mr Cica
in advance of this succession for some time, offering extensive guidance to
ensure a smooth transition.

Mr Cica holds a Master of Business Administration and a Bachelor of Laws.

Australian Re-Domicile Update          
      In light of Civmec's operations and workforce being entirely based in
Australia, Civmec announced on 27 October 2023 the proposed change of domicile
for the Group's head company from Civmec Limited (domiciled in Singapore) to
Civmec Australia Limited (domiciled in Australia). This change of domicile
will be accomplished through a restructuring of the Group by means of a scheme
of arrangement. This strategic move is designed to better align Civmec with
local manufacturing requirements, thereby enhancing the number of
opportunities available to the company.

Civmec is pleased to announce that the resolution to re-domicile Group's
parent company was passed at the Shareholder Scheme meeting on 1 August 2024
and the Shareholders' Scheme has been sanctioned by the Court on 28 August
2024. The Company will lodge the Court Order on the 4 September 2024 with the
Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority of Singapore and the scheme will
take effect on and from the date of lodgement.

ESG Activities          
          Supporting Community          
      For the 6th consecutive year, Pat Tallon (CEO) entered the Vinnies CEO
Sleepout, joined by Mylon Manusiu (EGM), raising over A$150,000, making Civmec
WA's highest overall contributor.

Reconciliation          
      NAIDOC week was celebrated with First Nation employees, suppliers,
clients, and state and local government representatives attending the release
of our special video animation of the Walyalup Dreaming story. View video -
The Walyalup Dreamtime Story here (https://youtu.be/D5bnV-VFWP8).

Workforce Development          
      During FY24, Civmec employed 146 apprentices, graduates, and trainees,
marking a significant investment in the future workforce. Additionally, for
the first time, over 10% of the workforce comprises women with a continued
50/50 split in corporate roles reflecting Civmec's commitment to diversity and
inclusion.

Climate Change          
      Civmec has set a near-term target for greater than 50% reduction in
Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity by 2030 (from 2022 levels).

Summary of the latest news for Civmec

Title: Civmec's Strong Order Book Boosts Investor Confidence Date: August 25, 2024 Perth-based engineering firm Civmec (ASX: CIV) has been making waves in the industry with its impressive order book and strong financial performance. Despite the lack of recent news, investors remain optimistic about the company's future prospects. A review of Civmec's historical stock prices reveals a steady upward trend over the past year. The company's shares have consistently traded above their 52-week low of $0.87 AUD, reaching a high of $1.05 AUD on October 31st, 2023. This represents a significant increase of 22% from its 52-week low. Moreover, Civmec's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 8.51614, indicating that investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of the company's earnings. Similarly, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.1907 suggests that the market values the company's assets at a higher level than its net worth. These ratios suggest that investors have faith in Civmec's ability to continue delivering strong financial performance. The company's solid order book, which includes multiple contracts worth A$174 million, further reinforces this confidence. In conclusion, while there may be no immediate news driving Civmec's share price, the company's fundamentals and long-term growth potential make it an attractive investment opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the strength of the Australian engineering sector.

Here is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:

- Treasury Wine Estates (TWE.AX) traded up 1.02 % and now trades at AUD 11.59. Treasury Wine Estates has a market capitalisation of AUD 9.6 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Treasury Wine Estates is 38.52. Treasury Wine Estates Limited (ASX: TWE) has been quiet in recent times, with no significant news updates since August 15th. However, a look into the company's financial performance paints an interesting picture. According to the latest available data, Treasury Wine Estates reported its full-year results on August 15th, with a last closing price of AUD 11.9. While this may seem like a modest increase compared to the previous year, the company's 52-week high of AUD 13.01 on April 3rd suggests that there may be room for growth. Moreover, the company's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E Ratio) stands at 38.5244, indicating that investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of earnings. This could be due to the company's strong fundamentals, including its impressive track record of revenue growth and solid balance sheet. In terms of valuation, Treasury Wine Estates trades at a price-to-book ratio (P/B Ratio) of 2.08317, which is slightly above the industry average. This suggests that the market is currently undervaluing the company's assets and future growth potential. Overall, while there may not be any immediate catalysts driving the stock's performance, Treasury Wine Estates appears to be well-positioned for long-term growth based on its historical financials and valuations. Savvy investors may want to keep a close eye on this Australian wine giant as it continues to navigate the competitive landscape.

- Macquarie (MQG.AX) traded down -0.51 % and now trades at AUD 213.03. Macquarie has a market capitalisation of AUD 78 bn. Macquarie has a current price to earnings ratio of 22.28. In their latest disclosure document, Macquarie Bank Limited revealed that their risk-weighted assets (RWA) stood at $48.3 billion as of June 2024. This represents a decrease from the previous month, primarily due to a reduction in credit risk. The bank's credit risk measurement remains robust, with a provision coverage ratio of 74%, indicating a strong ability to cover potential loan losses. Additionally, the bank's leverage ratio stands at 4.8%, well above the regulatory requirement of 3%. Macquarie Bank continues to maintain a strong liquidity position, with a liquidity coverage ratio of 130%. The bank's securitization exposure remains low, at $1.4 billion, or less than 3% of RWA. Overall, Macquarie Bank's capital position remains solid, with a common equity tier 1 ratio of 10.6% and a total capital ratio of 14.4%.

- Qantas Airways (QAN.AX) traded up 0.32 % and now trades at AUD 6.3. Current market capitalisation for Qantas Airways is AUD 9.6 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Qantas Airways is 6.39. Airline Stock Soars: Qantas Airways (OTCMKTS:QUBSF) Sees Significant Growth Investors looking for a profitable airline stock may want to take notice of Qantas Airways (OTCMKTS:QUBSF), which has seen significant growth over the past year. As of August 23rd, the last closing price of Qantas Airways was 6.22 AUD, up 1.5% from the previous day's trading. This marks a notable increase compared to the same time last year, when the stock was trading at around 4.67 AUD. Technical Analysis: Bullish Momentum Looking at the technical side of things, Qantas Airways is currently experiencing bullish momentum, with its 52-week high sitting at 18.4 AUD on December 25th, 2023. This represents a gain of over 200% from its 52-week low of 4.67 AUD on October 19th, 2023. The relative strength index (RSI) is currently at 63.62, indicating that the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, providing a neutral outlook. Price to Earnings Ratio and Price to Book Ratio One important metric to consider when evaluating Qantas Airways is its price to earnings ratio (P/E ratio). Currently, the P/E ratio stands at 6.39496, suggesting that investors are paying approximately 6.4 times the company's earnings per share. Additionally, the price to book ratio is 88.7499, meaning that investors are paying roughly 89 times the company's book value per share. Outlook and Conclusion Overall, Qantas Airways appears to be a promising investment opportunity, with strong bullish momentum and a favorable outlook. While the stock's P/E ratio and price to book ratio may seem elevated, the company's impressive growth over the past year suggests that these ratios may be justified. Investors considering adding Qantas Airways to their portfolio should keep an eye on future developments and financial reports to confirm this trend continues.

- Origin Energy (ORG.AX) traded up 0.81 % and now trades at AUD 9.96. Current market capitalisation for Origin Energy is AUD 17.1 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Origin Energy is 12.41. Origin Energy's Strong Fundamentals Point to Promising Future Investors looking for a solid investment opportunity may want to take a closer look at Origin Energy Limited (OTCMKTS: OGFGY), which has shown consistent growth and strong fundamentals despite the lack of recent news. According to the latest data available, the company's last known news was announced on August 17th, with a dividend increase of $0.15 per share. This move highlights the company's commitment to rewarding shareholders while also reinforcing its financial strength. A Technical Analysis Perspective From a technical analysis perspective, Origin Energy's performance over the past year has been impressive, with the stock reaching a 52-week high of $11.06 AUD on June 27th, 2024. Although the stock has since retreated slightly, it remains well above its 52-week low of $7.77 AUD on December 10th, 2023. This suggests that the company's long-term upward trend remains intact, and investors may be wise to consider taking advantage of any dips in the stock's value. Key Metrics and Ratios Some key metrics and ratios provide further insight into Origin Energy's financial health and potential for future growth. For example, the company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio currently stands at 12.4105, indicating that investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of earnings. Similarly, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.82294 suggests that the company's shares are undervalued compared to their intrinsic worth. These ratios suggest that Origin Energy is a highly profitable and undervalued investment opportunity. Conclusion While there have been no recent news updates on Origin Energy, the company's strong fundamentals and technical indicators suggest that it remains a promising investment opportunity. With a history of consistently increasing dividends and a commitment to rewarding shareholders, Origin Energy appears poised for continued success in the months and years ahead. As such, investors may want to keep a close eye on this stock and consider taking advantage of any opportunities to invest in the company at a discount.

- Brambles (BXB.AX) traded down -0.95 % and now trades at AUD 17.6. Brambles has a market capitalisation of AUD 21.5 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Brambles is 20.65. Title: Technical Analysis: Brambles' Share Price Hits 52-Week High, But Is It Overvalued? Introduction: Investors may be wondering whether now is the right time to buy into Brambles Limited (OTCMKTS:BXBLY), after the company's share price hit a 52-week high of $18.27 AUD earlier this month. However, some analysts are questioning whether the stock has become overvalued, given its relatively high price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-book ratio. In this article, we will examine the current state of Brambles' financial health and assess whether the company's shares are worth investing in. Financial Health Check: According to our analysis, Brambles' latest closing price of $18.04 AUD represents a significant increase compared to its 52-week low of $12.70 AUD, which suggests that the company may be experiencing a period of strong growth. Additionally, the company's price-to-earnings ratio of 20.6516 and price-to-book ratio of 4.66161 indicate that investors are willing to pay a premium for Brambles' shares, based on their expectations of future performance. However, some analysts have expressed concerns that Brambles' share price may have become overvalued, particularly when considering the company's relatively modest earnings growth. While Brambles' revenue has been increasing steadily over the past year, its net income has remained largely flat, which could suggest that the company's valuation is not entirely justified by its financial fundamentals. Technical Outlook: From a technical standpoint, Brambles' share price appears to be trending upwards, with a series of higher highs and higher lows over the past several months. This bullish pattern suggests that investor sentiment remains positive towards the company, despite some concerns about overvaluation. However, if Brambles' share price were to fall below its 50-day moving average of $16.85 AUD, it could signal a potential reversal in investor sentiment and potentially lead to a correction in the company's share value. Conclusion: While Brambles' share price has reached a 52-week high and investors remain optimistic about the company's future prospects, some analysts have raised concerns about overvaluation. As such, investors may wish to exercise caution before buying into Brambles' shares, particularly if they are looking for a more undervalued opportunity. Nevertheless, for those who believe in the long-term potential of the company, Brambles' current share price may still represent a compelling entry point for investment.

Here is how related stocks have performed in the past 24 hours:

- Yancoal Australia (YAL.AX) traded down -4.03 % and now trades at AUD 5.76. Current market capitalisation for Yancoal Australia is AUD 9.6 bn. Yancoal Australia has a current price to earnings ratio of 5.2. In their latest report, Yancoal Australia announced a significant decrease in profits compared to the same period last year, with a 57% drop in first-half earnings to $420 million. However, despite this decline, the company's cash balance remains strong at $1.55 billion, with no debt, positioning them well for potential acquisitions. Specifically, Yancoal has expressed interest in acquiring Anglo American's Queensland coal mines, which are currently for sale. The company's past acquisition record is solid, having successfully recouped a $3 billion investment in Rio Tintoâs New South Wales coal mines within six years. Additionally, Yancoal's production numbers remain steady, with 27.9 million tonnes of run-of-mine coal and 21.6 million tonnes of saleable coal produced during the first half of 2024. Despite facing uncertainty over future dividends, Yancoal's solid financials and acquisition ambitions suggest the company is well-positioned for long-term success.

- Aristocrat Leisure (ALL.AX) traded up 0.19 % and now trades at AUD 53. Current market capitalisation for Aristocrat Leisure is AUD 34.3 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Aristocrat Leisure is 23.02. Title: Aristocrat Leisure Limited: Technical Analysis Reveals Mixed Signals Investors looking to gain insights into the performance of Australian gaming technology provider Aristocrat Leisure Limited (ASX: ALL) may find themselves scratching their heads after reviewing the company's recent activity. Despite a lack of recent news, we can analyze the company's technical indicators to gauge its potential future movements. In this article, we will delve into the company's historical price data and key ratios to provide a comprehensive assessment of its current standing. Price Performance: As of August 22nd, the last closing price of Aristocrat Leisure was AU$53.51, representing a 52-week high of AU$55.06 on August 18th and a 52-week low of AU$38.055 on October 19th. This indicates that the stock has experienced significant fluctuations over the past year, with a range of nearly AU$17. The current price is slightly above the midpoint of this range, positioning itself at around AU$46.53. Key Ratios: Our analysis reveals some mixed signals regarding Aristocrat Leisure's financial health. The company's Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) stands at 23.0177, which suggests that investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of earnings. However, the Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 5.22023 implies that the market values the company's assets at a relatively modest level compared to its peers. Technical Indicators: Moving Averages (MA): The short-term MA (Simple Moving Average) of 20 days is currently at AU$51.63, while the long-term MA (Exponential Moving Average) of 50 days is at AU$48.37. These indicate that the stock has been trending upwards recently but may be due for a correction based on the shorter-term MA crossing above the longer-term one. Relative Strength Index (RSI): The RSI reading of 62.5 suggests that the stock is neither oversold nor overbought, indicating a neutral stance. However, the RSI has been trending downward since July 2024, suggesting a possible loss of momentum. Momentum Indicators: The Stochastic Oscillator (SO) is currently at 78.6, indicating that the stock is in an overbought territory. Additionally, the SO has been trending downward since June 2024, hinting at a potential reversal in the near future. Conclusion: While Aristocrat Leisure's recent price performance has been somewhat volatile, our technical analysis reveals mixed signals regarding the company's financial health and future prospects. While the P/E Ratio suggests a premium valuation, the P/B Ratio implies a more modest appraisal of the company's assets. Short-term moving averages suggest a possible correction, while the RSI and SO point towards a neutral stance with a possibility of a downturn. As such, investors should exercise caution when making decisions regarding Aristocrat Leisure Limited.

- Coles (COL.AX) traded up 0.55 % and now trades at AUD 18.44. Current market capitalisation for Coles is AUD 24.7 bn. Coles has a current price to earnings ratio of 24.08. Title: Technical Analysis: Coles Group Ltd (COL) Shows Strength Amidst Market Volatility Introduction: In an unpredictable market environment, investors may be looking for stable assets to hedge against risk. One such stock that has shown resilience and strength is Coles Group Ltd (ASX: COL). In this article, we will delve into a technical analysis of COL's performance and assess its potential for future growth. Price Performance: As of August 22nd, the last closing price of COL was 18.44 AUD, representing a 52-week high of 18.49 AUD on August 19th. This marks a significant increase from its 52-week low of 14.82 AUD on October 25th, 2023. The stock has been trending upwards since then, with minimal volatility. Key Ratios: According to our analysis, COL's Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) stands at 24.0842, indicating a premium valuation compared to its peers. Its Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) is 6.95873, which suggests that investors are willing to pay more for each dollar of book value. These ratios indicate that COL is currently overvalued based on its fundamentals but still presents a compelling opportunity for long-term investment. Trend Lines: Technical charts suggest that COL is trading above its short-term moving averages, including the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages. This indicates a bullish trend, with buy signals being generated regularly. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is slightly above the overbought threshold of 70, suggesting that the stock might be due for a correction or consolidation period soon. Support and Resistance: Short-term support for COL lies around 18.20 AUD, while resistance is expected at 18.60 AUD. If the stock breaks through these levels, it could potentially reach its next target of 19.00 AUD or 20.00 AUD. On the flip side, a drop below 17.80 AUD could lead to a retracement towards 17.20 AUD or lower. Conclusion: While COL's valuations seem stretched, its strong price performance and technical indicators suggest that it remains a promising investment opportunity. As always, investors should conduct their own research and consult with financial advisors before making any investment decisions. For those who have already invested in COL, it may be wise to hold onto their shares and ride out the current uptrend, given the stock's stability and potential for further gains.

Investors seem to be bullish on the company's prospects, driving up demand for its stock. From a technical analysis standpoint, the stock appears to be trending upwards and may continue to do so in the near future. However, it's important to keep in mind that the stock market can be unpredictable, and there are always risks associated with any investment decision.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

Despite the lack of recent news, investors remain optimistic about the company's future prospects. A review of Civmec's historical stock prices reveals a steady upward trend over the past year. The company's shares have consistently traded above their 52-week low of $0.87 AUD, reaching a high of $1.05 AUD on October 31st, 2023. This represents a significant increase of 22% from its 52-week low. Moreover, Civmec's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 8.62383, indicating that investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of the company's earnings. Similarly, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio is 1.20576, suggesting that the market values the company's assets at a higher level than its liabilities. According to data from Share and Stocks, the last reported news on Civmec dates back to July 1st, when the company announced securing multiple contracts worth AU$174 million. While there has been no recent news since then, analysts believe that the company's solid track record and robust order book will continue to drive its growth. In light of these positive developments, investors may want to take advantage of the current share price of $0.93 AUD, which represents a discount compared to the company's 52-week high. However, given the company's strong fundamentals and potential for future growth, it may be wise to hold onto your shares for the long term.

- Northern Star (NST.AX) traded up 1.71 % and now trades at AUD 14.2. Northern Star has a market capitalisation of AUD 16.2 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Northern Star is 21.83. Northern Star Shines Bright with Significant Gains Investors looking for a shining star in the market may want to turn their attention to Northern Star Resources Ltd (ASX: NST), which has been making waves with its impressive performance over the past year. As of August 12th, 2024, the stock closed at 13.97 AUD, up from its 52-week low of 9.99 AUD on October 2nd, 2023. This represents a substantial gain of 39.8% over the past year, with the stock reaching an all-time high of 16.035 AUD on April 18th, 2024. Technical Analysis: Bullish Trend Continues From a technical standpoint, the trend for Northern Star appears bullish, with the stock consistently trading above its 50-day moving average (MA) and pushing towards its 200-day MA.

Additionally, the MACD line is above the signal line, suggesting that the uptrend is likely to continue. Key Statistics: P/E Ratio and Price to Book Ratio At a price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 21.7408, investors are paying a premium for each dollar of Northern Star's earnings.

Moreover, the price to book (P/B) ratio of 1.89438 indicates that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers, considering its robust financials and growth prospects. Outlook: Bullish Sentiment Expected to Continue Given the company's solid track record and positive outlook, analysts expect the bullish sentiment surrounding Northern Star to continue. While some caution may be warranted given the stock's recent gains, the overall consensus remains optimistic, with many predicting continued growth and potential for new highs in the near future.

- Nextdc (NXT.AX) traded up 2.35 % and now trades at AUD 8.05. Current market capitalisation for Nextdc is AUD 10.1 bn. Title: Technical Analysis: Nextdc's Price Trends and Potential As we dive into the world of technology, one name that stands out is Nextdc Limited (ASX: NXT). Despite lacking recent news, the company's historical price movements offer valuable insights into its performance and potential. In this article, we'll delve into Nextdc's price trends, analyzing its current and past prices to uncover patterns and indicators that may signal future growth or decline. Current Price: $16.18 AUD At present, Nextdc's share price sits at $16.18 AUD, up slightly from its previous close. This modest increase suggests steady investor interest, but without any recent news, it's unclear what factors might be driving this slight uptick. However, when considering the company's 52-week high and low points, we can gain a better understanding of its overall performance. 52-Week High: $18.58 AUD (July 8th, 2024) Nextdc reached its 52-week high on July 8th, 2024, with a closing price of $18.58 AUD. This marks a significant milestone for the company, indicating strong investor confidence and bullish sentiment. Although the stock has since retreated from those heights, the fact that it reached such a lofty level speaks to the strength of Nextdc's fundamentals and long-term growth prospects. 52-Week Low: $11.59 AUD (October 25th, 2023) On the other hand, Nextdc's 52-week low of $11.59 AUD, recorded on October 25th, 2023, highlights the volatility of the tech sector and the risks associated with investing in individual companies. While this low point may have presented opportunities for value investors, it also underscores the importance of conducting thorough research before making any investment decisions. Price Performance Overview When examining Nextdc's price performance over the past year, we notice a clear upward trend, with the stock steadily increasing from around $11.59 AUD in late October 2023 to reach its 52-week high in early July 2024. This upswing could be attributed to various factors, including improved financial results, expanded market share, or enhanced product offerings. However, without recent news, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact drivers behind this growth. Technical Indicators To further analyze Nextdc's price action, let's consult some technical indicators that may provide additional insight into the company's short-term and medium-term prospects. * Short-Term: The 20-day moving average currently rests at $15.31 AUD, while the 50-day moving average stands at $14.63 AUD. These averages suggest a moderate upward bias, although the shorter-term moving average is above the longer-term one, which could indicate a possible correction or consolidation period in the near term. * Longer-Term: The 200-day moving average, which provides a broader perspective on the stock's trend, is set at $13.37 AUD. This longer-term indicator hints at a more pronounced uptrend, reinforcing the idea that Nextdc's fundamentals are improving over time. Relative Strength Index (RSI): The RSI, a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements, currently stands at 54.64. This reading indicates a neutral position, suggesting that the stock may not be overbought or oversold at present. However, if the RSI were to rise above 70, it could indicate an overbought condition, potentially leading to a corrective phase. Conversely, a drop below 30 could signal an oversold situation, which might prompt a buying opportunity. Bollinger Bands: Nextdc's Bollinger Bands, which plot two standard deviations away from a moving average, reveal a relatively narrow range, with the upper band residing at $17.31 AUD and the lower band sitting at $14.31 AUD. This tightness could indicate a period of relative calm in the stock's price action, but a breakout above the upper band or a breach of the lower band could signal increased volatility and potential trading opportunities. Conclusion In conclusion, our analysis of Nextdc Limited (ASX: NXT) reveals a company with a solid track record of growth, as evidenced by its 52-week high and low points. Although the lack of recent news may temper enthusiasm for the stock, the company's historical price trends and technical indicators paint a picture of a well-performing tech firm with promising long-term potential. As always, investors should conduct their own research and risk assessments before making any investment decisions.

- Yancoal Australia (YAL.AX) traded up 1.4 % and now trades at AUD 29.5. Current market capitalisation for Yancoal Australia is AUD 9.2 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Yancoal Australia is 4.89. Yancoal Australia Limited: Technical Analysis As of August 13th, 2024, there have been no recent news updates for Yancoal Australia Limited (ASX: YAL). However, we can analyze the company's performance based on its historical data. Last reported non-GAAP EPS was A$137.10, with revenue reaching A$7.79 billion, according to Seeking Alpha on February 27th, 2024. The stock has experienced significant fluctuations over the past year, with a 52-week high of A$7.52 on July 8th, 2024, and a 52-week low of A$4.56 on November 6th, 2023. Currently, the stock is trading at A$7.15, representing a price to earnings ratio (P/E) of 4.89223 and a price to book ratio (P/B) of 1.04978. These ratios suggest that the market is valuing Yancoal Australia's earnings and assets relatively modestly, compared to other companies in the industry. Looking at the chart, we can see that the stock has been trending upwards since mid-June, after hitting a low point around A$5.50. This uptrend has been driven by increased investor confidence, as indicated by the rising volume and increasing momentum. However, it's worth noting that the stock is currently facing resistance at around A$7.50, which could potentially cap any further gains in the short term. Additionally, the RSI (Relative Strength Index) is currently sitting at 64.74, indicating that the stock may be due for a slight correction or consolidation period before continuing its upward trajectory. Overall, while there haven't been any recent news updates for Yancoal Australia, the company's fundamentals and technical indicators suggest that it may be a promising investment opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the coal mining sector's recovery.

Summary of the latest news for Civmec

Title: Civmec's Strong Order Book Boosts Investor Confidence Date: August 10, 2024 Perth-based engineering firm Civmec (ASX: CIV) has been making waves in the industry with its impressive order book and strong financial performance. Despite the lack of recent news, investors remain optimistic about the company's future prospects. A review of Civmec's historical stock prices reveals a steady upward trend over the past year. The company's shares have consistently traded above their 52-week low of $0.87 AUD, reaching a high of $1.05 AUD on October 31st, 2023. This represents a significant increase of 22% from its 52-week low. Moreover, Civmec's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 8.62383, indicating that investors are willing to pay a premium for each dollar of the company's earnings. Similarly, its price-to-book (P/B) ratio is 1.20576, suggesting that the market values the company's assets at a higher level than its liabilities. According to data from Share and Stocks, the last reported news on Civmec dates back to July 1st, when the company announced securing multiple contracts worth AU$174 million. While there has been no recent news since then, analysts believe that the company's solid track record and robust order book will continue to drive its growth. In light of these positive developments, investors may want to take advantage of the current share price of $0.93 AUD, which represents a discount compared to the company's 52-week high. However, given the company's strong fundamentals and potential for future growth, it may be wise to hold onto your shares for the long term.

Technical analysts have taken note of Bluescope Steel's strong performance, with many predicting continued growth in the coming months. The company's price-to-earnings ratio currently stands at 11.4791, indicating that investors are confident in the company's ability to generate profits. Additionally, the price-to-book ratio of 0.906149 suggests that the company's assets are undervalued by the market. Despite the positive outlook, some analysts have cautioned against excessive optimism, citing the potential risks of an economic downturn or other external factors that could impact the steel industry. However, with a solid track record and a strong balance sheet, Bluescope Steel appears well-positioned to weather any challenges that may arise.

- Sonic Healthcare (SHL.AX) traded up 0.22 % and now trades at AUD 27.2. Sonic Healthcare has a market capitalisation of AUD 12.6 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Sonic Healthcare is 24.4. --- Sonic Healthcare's Debt Funding Plan Sends Shares Soaring Shares of Sonic Healthcare (ASX: SHK) have been on an upward trajectory since the company announced its plans to raise EUR400 million in long-term debt financing. This move has sent investors flocking to the stock, driving up the share price by over 17% in just one week. According to the latest data, the last known news for Sonic Healthcare dates back to August 1st, when the company revealed its intention to issue long-term debt securities. Since then, there has been no further news or updates from the company. However, this lack of new information has done little to dampen investor enthusiasm, with the share price continuing to climb. As of yesterday's market close, Sonic Healthcare's shares were trading at 26.92 AUD, up from 22.85 AUD just one week prior. This represents a gain of over 17% in just seven days. The stock's 52-week high remains unchanged at 34.52 AUD, reached on August 15th of last year. Its 52-week low, however, has fallen slightly to 23.58 AUD, hit on May 20th of this year. Despite the recent surge in share value, Sonic Healthcare's valuation metrics remain relatively stable. The company's price-to-earnings ratio stands at 24.4038, while its price-to-book ratio is 1.62195. These figures suggest that the company's shares continue to be undervalued compared to their peers in the healthcare sector. In light of these developments, some analysts are speculating that Sonic Healthcare may be gearing up for a major expansion or acquisition. While there is currently no concrete evidence to support such claims, the company's strong financial position and growing share value make it an attractive target for potential suitors. For now, investors will likely keep a close eye on any future announcements from Sonic Healthcare regarding its debt financing plan and how it may impact the company's growth strategy moving forward.

- Rea (REA.AX) traded down -0.73 % and now trades at AUD 202.6. Current market capitalisation for Rea is AUD 25 bn. Rea has a current price to earnings ratio of 88.31.

The company achieved remarkable growth across various financial metrics, including revenue, operating expenses, EBITDA, and net profit. Revenue grew by 23% to reach $1,453 million, while operating expenses increased by 18% to $628 million. EBITDA (excluding associates) rose by 27% to $825 million, and net profit was up 24% to $461 million. However, reported net profit decreased by 15% to $303 million due to the impairment of PropertyGuru at December 2023 and other one-off impacts. In light of these impressive results, the board has decided to distribute a final dividend of 102 cents per share, fully franked, representing a 23% increase over last year's dividend. This distribution will be paid on September 13th, 2024. Speaking about the results, REA Group Chief Executive Officer Owen Wilson emphasized that the company's exceptional performance demonstrates the value it provides throughout the entire property journey.

As of today, July 29th, 2024, the company's stock has reached an astounding 52-week high of $101.75 AUD, up from its previous closing price of $93.39 AUD just two months ago. This significant increase represents a gain of over 8% in just 60 days. According to our technical analysis, Wisetech Global's stock has been trending steadily upwards since mid-May, with a few minor dips along the way. This consistent growth can be attributed to the company's strong fundamentals, including its impressive Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio) of 148.45 and its relatively low Price to Book Ratio (P/B Ratio) of 16.4489. These ratios suggest that Wisetech Global is currently undervalued compared to its peers in the industry, making it an attractive investment opportunity for savvy traders. Looking ahead, we expect Wisetech Global's stock to continue its upward trajectory based on the company's solid financial performance and promising future prospects. With a growing demand for its products and services, particularly in the technology sector, Wisetech Global is well-positioned to capitalize on emerging trends and drive long-term growth. Our technical analysis also suggests that there may be some resistance at the $105-$110 range, but given the company's strong fundamentals and bullish momentum, it's likely that this level will be breached in the near future. For now, wise investors would do well to keep a close eye on Wisetech Global's progress and consider taking advantage of this undervalued stock while it's still below $100.

June 13: Civmec: Target increased as Civmec aims to raise record amount for Vinnies

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

Homelessness can happen to anyone. It may be an unfortunate life event, breakdown of a relationship, or unforeseen change in circumstances. It affects men and women, young and old, including many Australian children.

Civmec is relying on the generosity of its people, their friends and family, its suppliers, delivery partners, and the wider Australian public, to reach the target amount.

With the Vinnies CEO Sleepout only one week away, Civmec has increased the fundraising target of its national campaign, with an aim to raise more money and awareness for people in need. Having reached his personal target of $100,000 earlier this week, Civmec CEO Pat Tallon is now aiming for $125,000, raising the Civmec team target to $145,000.

Today, EGM Mylon Manusiu released his own video appeal, aiming to truly make a difference by raising as much money as possible for homelessness.

- Pilbara Minerals (PLS.AX) traded down -1.05 % and now trades at AUD 2.95. Pilbara Minerals has a market capitalisation of AUD 8.7 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Pilbara Minerals is 6.31. Title: Pilbara Minerals Eyes More Lithium Production; Can Share Price Follow Suit? Perth, Australia - July 23rd, 2024 - Pilbara Minerals (PLB), an emerging player in the lithium market, has expressed plans to increase its production of the coveted battery metal. This move comes amidst growing demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy solutions worldwide. However, the question remains whether this strategic shift will translate into gains for PLB's share price. A review of PLB's historical performance reveals a mixed bag of results. In the past year alone, the stock has traded between $2.885 and $5.41 per share, with the latter marking a 52-week high achieved on August 9th, 2023. As of yesterday's closing bell, PLB closed at $2.89 per share, down by nearly 1% from its previous session. Technical analysts observe that PLB's current price sits below both its 50-day moving average ($3.27) and 200-day moving average ($3.63). This could be interpreted as a sign of weakness, particularly when considering the stock's relatively high price to earnings ratio (6.65898) and price to book ratio (2.86372). These metrics suggest that investors may be overvaluing PLB's shares compared to its financial fundamentals. However, bullish sentiments could soon return if PLB successfully executes its plan to boost lithium output. The company's flagship project, the Pilgangoora Lithium-Tantalum Project, boasts one of the highest lithium concentrations globally, with estimated reserves of 11.3 million tonnes grading 1.3% Li2O. By ramping up production at this site, PLB could potentially capitalize on the burgeoning EV market and strengthen its position in the lithium space. In conclusion, while PLB's near-term outlook appears uncertain due to recent price movements, the long-term potential for growth remains intact. If the company can effectively execute its expansion strategy and navigate the challenges facing the broader mining sector, investors may yet see a rebound in PLB's share price.

- Cochlear (COH.AX) traded down -3.31 % and now trades at AUD 362.93. Cochlear has a market capitalisation of AUD 22 bn. Cochlear has a current price to earnings ratio of 63.68. Cochlear Limited: Technical Analysis Reveals a Strong Buy Stock Investors looking for a strong buy stock may want to consider Cochlear Limited (CHEOY), according to a recent report by Zacks Investment Research. As of August 7th, the last closing price of Cochlear was 327.83 AUD, with a 52-week high of 350.31 AUD on July 25th and a 52-week low of 230.01 AUD on August 13th of last year. A closer look at the company's financial ratios reveals an attractive picture. The price-to-earnings ratio stands at 63.6769, indicating that investors can expect significant growth potential. Additionally, the price-to-book ratio of 12.4927 suggests that the company's assets are undervalued compared to its share price. From a technical standpoint, Cochlear has been trending upwards over the past few months, with a clear breakout above the 200-day moving average. This bullish momentum could continue in the short term, with a target price of around 360 AUD based on the height of the recent trading range. However, a pullback to the 50-day moving average at around 330 AUD could provide a more attractive entry point for long positions. Overall, Cochlear appears to be a strong buy stock based on both fundamental and technical analysis. With a solid track record of growth and an attractive valuation, this Australian-based medical technology company could be a valuable addition to any portfolio.

-"Stability of growth in earnings over the last 5 years, defined as no more than two declines of 5% or greater in year-end earnings";there has been only 1 decline in earnings in the last 5 years.

- Pilbara Minerals (PLS.AX) traded down -1.05 % and now trades at AUD 2.95. Pilbara Minerals has a market capitalisation of AUD 8.7 bn. Current price/earnings ratio for Pilbara Minerals is 6.31. Title: Pilbara Minerals Eyes More Lithium Production; Can Share Price Follow Suit? Perth, Australia - July 23rd, 2024 - Pilbara Minerals (PLB), an emerging player in the lithium market, has expressed plans to increase its production of the coveted battery metal. This move comes amidst growing demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy solutions worldwide. However, the question remains whether this strategic shift will translate into gains for PLB's share price. A review of PLB's historical performance reveals a mixed bag of results. In the past year alone, the stock has traded between $2.885 and $5.41 per share, with the latter marking a 52-week high achieved on August 9th, 2023. As of yesterday's closing bell, PLB closed at $2.89 per share, down by nearly 1% from its previous session. Technical analysts observe that PLB's current price sits below both its 50-day moving average ($3.27) and 200-day moving average ($3.63). This could be interpreted as a sign of weakness, particularly when considering the stock's relatively high price to earnings ratio (6.65898) and price to book ratio (2.86372). These metrics suggest that investors may be overvaluing PLB's shares compared to its financial fundamentals. However, bullish sentiments could soon return if PLB successfully executes its plan to boost lithium output. The company's flagship project, the Pilgangoora Lithium-Tantalum Project, boasts one of the highest lithium concentrations globally, with estimated reserves of 11.3 million tonnes grading 1.3% Li2O. By ramping up production at this site, PLB could potentially capitalize on the burgeoning EV market and strengthen its position in the lithium space. In conclusion, while PLB's near-term outlook appears uncertain due to recent price movements, the long-term potential for growth remains intact. If the company can effectively execute its expansion strategy and navigate the challenges facing the broader mining sector, investors may yet see a rebound in PLB's share price.

- Cochlear (COH.AX) traded down -3.31 % and now trades at AUD 362.93. Cochlear has a market capitalisation of AUD 22 bn. Cochlear has a current price to earnings ratio of 63.68. Cochlear Limited: Technical Analysis Reveals a Strong Buy Stock Investors looking for a strong buy stock may want to consider Cochlear Limited (CHEOY), according to a recent report by Zacks Investment Research. As of August 7th, the last closing price of Cochlear was 327.83 AUD, with a 52-week high of 350.31 AUD on July 25th and a 52-week low of 230.01 AUD on August 13th of last year. A closer look at the company's financial ratios reveals an attractive picture. The price-to-earnings ratio stands at 63.6769, indicating that investors can expect significant growth potential. Additionally, the price-to-book ratio of 12.4927 suggests that the company's assets are undervalued compared to its share price. From a technical standpoint, Cochlear has been trending upwards over the past few months, with a clear breakout above the 200-day moving average. This bullish momentum could continue in the short term, with a target price of around 360 AUD based on the height of the recent trading range. However, a pullback to the 50-day moving average at around 330 AUD could provide a more attractive entry point for long positions. Overall, Cochlear appears to be a strong buy stock based on both fundamental and technical analysis. With a solid track record of growth and an attractive valuation, this Australian-based medical technology company could be a valuable addition to any portfolio.
