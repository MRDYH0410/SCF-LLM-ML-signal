By Henning Gloystein

SINGAPORE, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Oil traders from around the world, including the United States, Britain and Brazil, have tripled their sales to Asia as they take advantage of an emerging supply gap following OPEC-led production cuts announced late last year.

Around 30 supertankers have this month made long-haul trips to ship crude oil from the Americas, the North Sea and the Mediterranean to refineries across Asia, the world's biggest and fastest growing consumer, data extracted from Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts shows.

The unusual movements follow the decision late last year by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers including Russia to cut production by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) during the first half of this year in a bid to rein in global oversupply and prop up prices.

Companies most involved in the long-haul deals include major oil producers such as BP and Royal Dutch Shell , private commodity traders Trafigura, Vitol and Mercuria, and Chinese refiner Unipec <600028.SS>, trading sources say. Energy and mining giant Glencore , Azerbaijan's state-oil firm Socar and Brazil's Petrobras have also been involved.

Taking advantage of relatively low freight costs and regional crude oil price differentials - known as arbitrage, or arb - traders can profit from supply shortages in one region and oversupply in another.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures , for example, currently trade at around $54.50 per barrel, while international benchmark Brent crude costs $56.90 - a Brent premium over WTI of $2.40 a barrel, compared with near parity in late November, just before OPEC announced its cuts.

"The OPEC cuts have ... led to an open arb for long-haul cargoes, leading to a rise in long-haul crude imports (which) make up for the decline in OPEC (supplies)," said Tushar Bansal, director of Ivy Global Energy, a Singapore-based consultancy.

The cuts are an OPEC policy reversal after two years of pumping out oil and keeping prices low as the cartel sought to squeeze rival exporters.

"OPEC production cuts... created distortions in the Asian crude market, changing global trade patterns," BMI Research said in a note to clients.

OPEC CEDES MARKET SHARE

Helping fill the OPEC gap, crude shipments to Asia from the United States, Britain, Brazil, and even war-torn Libya jumped to over 35 million barrels in February, or 1.26 million bpd, from 10.4 million barrels in October, or 336,000 bpd, the data shows.

For OPEC, which typically meets around 70 percent of Asia's oil demand, that means a 5 percent loss of market share since October.

"Under current oil market conditions, OPEC risks losing market share with further production cuts," said Carole Nakhle, director of advisory firm Crystol Energy in London.

Although OPEC's relationship with customers in Asia tends to be good, refiners in North Asia's consumer hubs of Japan, China, and South Korea say they will readily turn to other suppliers in order to meet their needs. [nL4N1DV093]

Loading schedules show U.S. crude exports to Asia increased to more than 3.5 million barrels this month - including a first U.S. oil cargo delivery to India - from below 1 million in October. UK shipments have jumped to more than 10.5 million barrels from just 1.6 million.

Shipments to Asia from Brazil have hit a record 16.7 million barrels in February, up from 6.9 million in October, and Libya, an OPEC-member exempted from the cuts, doubled its Asia shipments to 2 million barrels last month.

Shipping schedules show the trend continuing into March.

BMI said the OPEC cuts, especially of medium and sour crude grades, were "providing opportunities for (similar)... Mediterranean crudes to flow into the Asian market," which include Libyan oil.

WILL THE ARB LAST?

One of the first major long-haul shipments to Asia in this round of arbitrage trading was by BP, which late last year used more than half a dozen tankers to ship almost 3 million barrels of U.S. crude as far as 30,000 km (18,641 miles) to Australia, Thailand and Japan. [nL4N1DM32X]

In similar deals, Unipec and Trafigura have shipped U.S. oil from the Gulf of Mexico to China. [nL4N1G13GD] [nL4N1DQ2HX]

Shippers of North Sea crude to Asia have included Vitol, Mercuria, Trafigura, Glencore, Shell, Unipec and Socar. [nL4N1F12DP] [nL4N1FN147]

The main exporter from Brazil has been state-owned Petrobras, shipping data shows, with traders saying its crude has replaced oil from OPEC-member Angola.

Oystein Berentsen, managing director for crude oil trader Strong Petroleum in Singapore, said arbitrage for North Sea and U.S. oil to Asia has been possible due to the OPEC-led cuts, and these routes "may continue depending on freight and price spreads."

Benchmark Middle-East to Japan freight rates for supertankers (VLCC) <.BAWC> are at 71 points on a so-called Worldscale rate based on 100, compared to a long-term average rate of around 76 over the last 10 years.

"The whole reason arb opportunities are there is because of weak freight," said Matt Stanley, a fuel broker at Freight Investor Services in Dubai.

It's not clear how long this arb window will remain open.

Strong Petroleum's Berentsen said that despite the OPEC cuts "there is still oversupply, but the market will probably balance in the third quarter. Then we'll see if the arb still works."

By Chen Aizhu and Ruma Paul

BEIJING/DHAKA, Feb 22 (Reuters) - China's state-run Zhenhua Oil has signed a preliminary deal with Chevron to buy the U.S. oil major's natural gas fields in Bangladesh that are worth about $2 billion, two Beijing-based Chinese oil executives said.

Zhenhua is a subsidiary of China's defence industry conglomerate NORINCO. A completed deal would mark China's first major energy investment in the South Asian country, where Beijing is competing with New Delhi and Tokyo for influence.

Bangladesh, though, holds the right of first refusal on the assets and could block the transaction. The country, via its national oil company Petrobangla, is keen to buy the gas fields and is talking to international banks to raise financing, according to a banking source familiar with the process.

Bangladesh is in the process of hiring global energy consultant Wood Mackenzie to assess the fields' reserves before placing a formal bid to buy the assets, two Bangladesh sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. [nL1N1D106W]

The Bangladesh sources said they were not aware of Zhenhua Oil's competing interest in the Chevron fields.

"As this project is in the process of commercial discussions, we can't comment based on our company policy," said Zhang Xiaodi, Zhenhua Oil's spokesman.

Zhenhua Oil is a small oil and gas explorer that despite its connections to China's defence industry is dwarfed in comparison to state energy giants PetroChina <0857.HK> and Sinopec <0386.HK>. It is trying to formalise its deal with Chevron by June, after the two companies signed a preliminary pact in January, the two senior oil executives told Reuters.

Zhenhua will partner with China Reform Holdings Corp Ltd, an investment vehicle under the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC). Zhenhua will hold 60 percent of the deal and China Reform 40 percent, the two executives said.

The executives declined to be named as these discussions were not public.

Chevron, in an e-mailed statement, confirmed that it was in commercial discussions on its Bangladesh assets, but would not comment further as a matter of policy.

Chevron had said in October 2015 that it planned to sell about $10 billion worth of assets by 2017 including geothermal projects in Indonesia and the Philippines and gas fields in Bangladesh amid a prolonged slump in energy prices.

Bangladesh knows that Chevron is in talk with global companies, but has no specific knowledge about Zhenhua's interest, said Nasrul Hamid, state minister for power, energy and mineral resources.

"This is Chevron's matter. We'll not interrupt but we are supposed to get the first priority," he said when asked if Bangladesh would try to block the China deal.

"We will place a formal bid only if the project is viable," Hamid said.

Chevron sells the entire output from its three gas fields - Bibiyana, Jalalabad and Moulavi Bazar, which account for more than half of Bangladesh's total gas output - to state energy firm Petrobangla under a production sharing contract.

ZHENHUA BEAT OUT CHINA RIVAL

With output and revenue slashed by low oil prices for the last nearly three years, China's state energy firms are under pressure to step up efforts to boost reserves and profits as Brent crude stabilizes around $55 a barrel.

Zhenhua Oil appears to have outrivaled competing bidders by partnering with the state investment vehicle China Reform, the Chinese executives said.

Geo-Jade Petroleum Corp <600759.SS>, an independent Chinese oil and gas explorer, was a close competitor with a bid at $2.3 billion, said one of the executives.

"Possibly because Zhenhua is a state-owned company and has the backing of China Reform, that's why it was picked by Chevron," said the executive.

Zhenhua Oil has oil and gas operations in Iraq, Kazakhstan, Syria, Myanmar and Egypt.

If the Bangladesh deal materializes, it would hand the Chinese firm 16 million tonnes a year of oil equivalent output, including natural gas and condensate, a scale that would make it China's fourth-largest oil and gas producer, the two Chinese executives said.

SINGAPORE, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Oil traders from around the world, including the United States, Britain and Brazil, have tripled their sales to Asia as they take advantage of an emerging supply gap following OPEC-led production cuts announced late last year.

Around 30 supertankers have this month made long-haul trips to ship crude oil from the Americas, the North Sea and the Mediterranean to refineries across Asia, the world's biggest and fastest growing consumer, data extracted from Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts shows.

Strong Petroleum's Berentsen said that despite the OPEC cuts "there is still oversupply, but the market will probably balance in the third quarter. Then we'll see if the arb still works."

Papua New Guinea LNG export plant seeks to sell 6 cargos in tender-trade - 路透新闻

{{20170221T120224.775+0000}}Papua New Guinea LNG export plant seeks to sell 6 cargos in tender-tradeMILAN, Feb 21 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil's Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas (PNG LNG) export facility is seeking to sell six cargoes in a tender, trade sources said.

Cargoes are for delivery between May and October, traders said, adding that they expected the tender to attract high levels of interest.

"It's also a bearish sign that PNG is trying to sell so many ... it suggests expected demand from the plant's long-term customers in Japan, Taiwan and others is weak," one source said.

Customers at the 6.9 million tonnes a year plant are Tokyo Electric Power Company <9501.T>, Osaka Gas <9532.T>, Taiwan's CPC and China's Sinopec <600028.SS>.

* 600,000-barrel US Gulf Coast Blend crude cargo landed in January

* CCI to load 1 mln bbls heavy crude from U.S. for China in Feb

* Teapot close to buying 1 mln bbls Mars oil for April delivery

By Florence Tan and Liz Hampton

SINGAPORE/HOUSTON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Chinese independent, or teapot, refiners are bringing in rare cargoes of North American heavy crude in a new long-distance flow that traders say has only been made possible by OPEC's output cuts and ample supplies in Canada and the United States.

In April, at least 1 million barrels of the heavy crude Mars, pumped from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, are expected to land in China's Shandong province and 1 million barrels of a second unidentified heavy grade will arrive in China, trade and shipping sources said last week. This follows the arrival in January of 600,000 barrels of U.S. Gulf Blend, a heavy crude made up of a blend of various U.S. and Canadian grades loaded onto ships on the U.S. Gulf Coast, according to the sources and shipping data.

Heavy crude is typically more dense and viscous than other oil grades. Refiners with facilities that can process these grades value heavy crude because its lower cost results in higher margins from producing fuels from these grades.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' (OPEC) output cuts have targeted heavy crude, with linchpin producer Saudi Arabia and Venezuela reducing their exports of heavy crude. That has increased the price of Middle East heavy crudes for Asian delivery, making it economical for traders to ship crude from Russia, the Atlantic Basin and the United States to Asia.

"The OPEC cuts started from medium and heavy grades and Venezuela (a key supplier to China) is exporting less," said a Singapore-based crude oil trader.

The tightening heavy crude supplies are occurring at a time when demand for these types has increased after refiners upgraded their plants, the trader said. Heavy crude typically yields a higher percentage of residue fuels when first processed at a refinery and that residue is then reformulated into higher-value fuels such as gasoline and diesel fuel in so-called cracking units.

Since late last year, China, the world's second-largest oil consumer, has stepped up imports from North America, one of the few regions where oil production is growing.

Asia's strong pull for heavy sour crude from the Americas led Mars to hit its highest level in a year relative to North American price benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) as traders forecast increased export demand from Asia. [nL1N1FV1RM]

The Ligurian Sea, a Suezmax tanker, loaded 600,000 barrels of U.S. Gulf Coast Blend from Port Arthur in Texas. The tanker then went around South Africa to arrive at Lanshan port in Shandong in early January after a 55-day journey, shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon showed.

The cargo contained Canadian Access Western Blend, a heavy sour grade with an API gravity of about 22 degrees and nearly 4 percent sulphur, said two trade sources who track oil flows.

Chinese agent Sinoenergy sold the bulk of the cargo to Shandong Tianhong Chemical and the rest went to Shandong Haiyou Petrochemical Group, they said.

The Mars cargo may go to Chinese independent refiner Shandong Wonfull Petrochemical Group, who are close to buying the heavy-sour grade for the first time for April delivery, said a source with knowledge of the proposed deal. The source declined to be named due to company policy.

Wonfull will likely buy the cargo from Swiss trader Trafigura [TRAFG.UL], an active seller of U.S. crude in Asia, said a second trader who closely tracks oil deals in Shangdong.

Castleton Commodities International (CCI) also plans to ship 1 million barrels of an unknown heavy crude grade from the United States to China onboard the Suezmax tanker Erviken which is scheduled to load on Feb. 20, according to one trader, a source in the shipping industry and shipping data.

Sinoenergy, Trafigura, Wonfull, CCI and Haiyou declined to comment. Tianhong could not be reached for comment. [nL1N1FN1N4]

UPDATE 1-As OPEC cuts, traders send European oil volumes to Asia - Reuters News

* Arbitrage open for European oil to Asia

* Exports from North Sea, Azerbaijan to Asia hit record in January

(Adds map, table, no change to text)

By Florence Tan and Mark Tay

SINGAPORE, Jan 11 (Reuters) - European and Chinese traders are shipping a record 22 million barrels of crude from the North Sea and Azerbaijan to Asia this month, seeking to plug any supply gap left by OPEC production cuts.

Over 11 million barrels of North Sea Forties crude have either been offloaded or are on their way to Asia, adding to a record 11 million barrels of Azeri crude oil from Azerbaijan, Reuters oil trade flows data showed.

The record export volumes come on expectations of tighter Middle East crude supplies due to plans by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to cut production in an attempt to prop up prices. [nL5N1EZ1T3]

Seeing an opportunity to sell North Sea oil profitably in arbitrage deals to Asia, seven supertankers chartered by commodity traders Vitol and Mercuria, European oil major Royal Dutch Shell , and China's refiner Unipec <600028.SS>, have either delivered or are expected to soon offload European crude to China and South Korea this month, according to trade sources and Reuters data.

"Asia needs the oil, Europe has it. The OPEC cut has raised prices, and that now makes it profitable to send European oil to Asia," said one senior trader with knowledge of the deals on condition of anonymity as he is not allowed to talk to media.

December's OPEC deal, in which the group agreed to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half of 2017, pushed up benchmark price Dubai against Brent and West Texas Intermediate , allowing Asia to pull more competitively priced supplies from the Atlantic Basin. [nL8N1DW31U]

An ongoing Brent contango, a market structure where oil becomes more expensive in future months, also enabled traders to lock in profits for crude on long voyages.

Shipping North Sea Forties crude from its load port Hound Point in Britain to customers in North Asia, including Japan, South Korea and China, takes over six weeks.

BATTLE FOR ASIA

The deals highlight the predicament facing OPEC and other producers that have agreed to cuts, including Russia and Oman.

While cutting supplies may temporarily lift prices, this gives other producers like western oil firms an opportunity to fill the gap and sell oil to Asia, the world's biggest demand region.

"The real market battleground is East of Suez," said John Driscoll, director of Singapore-based energy consultancy JTD Energy Services, referring to the Suez Canal through which many tankers ship oil between Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.

The ships now carrying European oil to Asia have 11 million barrels of Forties crude loaded, beating a previous record of 10 million barrels in December 2015, Thomson Reuters Eikon trade flow data showed.

And more oil is to come. Two more Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) supertankers with 2 million barrels of Forties crude each are due to arrive in North Asia in February, while three VLCCs have been provisionally booked to load oil this month for arrival in Asia in March-April, the data showed.

Crude output at China's Daqing oilfield falls 4.8 pct in 2016 - CNPC - Reuters News

{{20170109T143557.259+0000}}Crude output at China's Daqing oilfield falls 4.8 pct in 2016 - CNPCBEIJING, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Output at the Daqing oilfield, China's largest, fell 4.8 percent last year as operator PetroChina <0857.HK> scaled back production at the aging, high-cost field amid a drop in global oil prices.

Daqing, a 57-year-old field in China's northeastern Heilongjiang province, produced 36.56 million tonnes of crude oil last year, parent company China National Petroleum Company said on its website on Monday. That is equivalent to about 729,000 barrels per day.

The report did not give a comparison. But, CNPC has separately reported the field's output was 38.39 million tonnes in 2015, meaning last year's output was 4.8 percent lower.

Benchmark Brent crude futures averaged $45.10 a barrel in 2016, according to data on Thomson Reuters Eikon, 16 percent lower than in 2015.

Daqing's natural gas output rose to 3.77 billion cubic metres (bcm), CNPC said in statement on Monday. That is up from an earlier CNPC report of 3.53 bcm in 2015.

(1 tonne crude = 7.3 barrels)

Hong Kong stocks set for best week in 4 months; China shares slide - Reuters News

{{20170106T044758.419+0000}}Hong Kong stocks set for best week in 4 months; China shares slide* SSEC -0.1 pct, CSI300 -0.3 pct, HSI +0.4 pct

* Hong Kong stocks rise on weak U.S. dollar

* Energy sectors advance on oil prices

SHANGHAI, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Hong Kong stocks extended yesterday's sharp gains on Friday morning, set to have their best week in four months, as weakness in the U.S. currency and low treasury yields helped ease fears of capital outflow from emerging markets.

The benchmark Hang Seng index <.HSI> added 0.4 percent, to 22,546.76 points, while the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index <.HSCE> gained 0.2 percent, to 9,616.88 points.

Barring a correction, the benchmark index was set to have its best weekly gain since Sep. 9, up around 2.5 percent.

The dollar index <.DXY>, which tracks the greenback against six major world currencies, hit a low of 101.37 in early trade, around 2.4 percent down from a intraday high set on Tuesday.

Most sectors in Hong Kong gained modestly, with tech stocks <.HSCIIT> the best performer, up more than 1 percent.

MAINLAND STOCK MARKET

China stocks pulled back in early trade, but Shanghai shares were poised to break a five-week losing streak as the market carries solid momentum into 2017 amid signs of economic stabilisation.

The Shanghai Composite Index <.SSEC> lost 0.1 percent, to 3,161.77 points, putting on nearly 1.9 percent so far this week. The blue-chip CSI300 index <.CSI300> fell 0.3 percent, to 3,357.50 points.

"Investors are likely to stay lukewarm on the stock market until the end of Lunar New year when sentiment is expected to improve," said Cao Xuefeng, head of research at Huaxi Securities.

He noted that Friday's bearish sentiment on the mainland, as the market corrects, was partially offset by strength among energy majors and Beijing's efforts to defend the yuan.

China's central bank set the official yuan midpoint at 6.8668 per dollar prior to market opening on Friday, the strongest fixing in a month, sparking speculation that Beijing wants a firm grip on the currency ahead of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's inauguration later this month. [nZZN3FX200]

Market response towards the finance ministry's resolution to study new measures to cut taxes and reduce the overall cost burden on firms was muted. [nL4N1EV55D]

Sector performance on the mainland was mixed.

Property stocks retreated despite media reports that China's average home prices were forecast to rise 4.1 percent in 2017. [nL4N1EV3IO]

Japan's Inpex in running to develop major Iran oilfield -media - Reuters News

{{20170104T081512.895+0000}}Japan's Inpex in running to develop major Iran oilfield -mediaTOKYO, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Japan's Inpex Corp <1605.T> is in the running to develop a major oilfield in Iran, Kyodo News reported on Wednesday, as Tehran looks to aggressively ramp up crude output following the lifting of sanctions.

Japan's top energy developer is a strong candidate for the project after signing a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to look into developing the Azadegan oilfield, Kyodo said, citing Noreddin Shahnazizadeh, managing director of Iran's Petroleum Engineering and Development Company.

Kyodo reported that a tender would be held around the first quarter of this year.

An Inpex spokesman declined to comment on the report, which also said that France's Total , Royal Dutch Shell , Malaysia's Petronas [PETR.UL] and China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) [CNPET.UL] had signed similar MOUs.

Inpex in 2010 was forced to give up a stake in the Azadegan oilfield due to Western sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme.

Iran has named 29 international companies as being allowed to bid for oil and gas projects using the new, less restrictive Iran Petroleum Contract (IPC) model, including five Japanese firms, Inpex, Itochu Corp <8001.T>, Japan Petroleum Exploration (Japex) <1662.T>, Mitsubishi Corp <8058.T> and Mitsui.

UPDATE 1-Sinopec mandates 6 banks to advise on unit revamp ahead of IPO-IFR - Reuters News

{{20170104T063440.084+0000}}UPDATE 1-Sinopec mandates 6 banks to advise on unit revamp ahead of IPO-IFR* Fuels distribution unit to restructure ahead of IPO

* Six banks to advise on Sinopec Marketing revamp-IFR

* Listing could raise $12 bln, depending on markets

(Adds banks' comments, details on Sinopec Marketing)

HONG KONG, Jan 4 (Reuters) - China Petroleum and Chemical Corp (Sinopec) <0386.HK> has mandated six banks to advise it on a restructuring of its fuels distribution unit ahead of a planned initial public offering in Hong Kong, IFR reported on Wednesday, citing people close to the deal.

Sinopec tapped China International Capital Corp Ltd (CICC) <3908.HK>, China Merchants Securities Co Ltd <600999.SS>, CITIC Securities Co Ltd <600030.SS> <6030.HK>, Citigroup , Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley for the financial advisory role, added IFR, a Thomson Reuters publication.

The company had invited 14 banks to pitch for the role, people close to the deal previously told Reuters.

The advisers will help the unit, Sinopec Marketing Co Ltd, transition from a limited liability company, which has less than 50 shareholders, into a corporation that can have a multitude of investors and a board of directors, among other things, one person said.

The IPO could raise about $12 billion, a separate person said, though the value is subject to market conditions at the time of the listing. [nL4N1E939K]

China Merchants Securities, CICC, Citigroup and Goldman declined to comment, while Sinopec, CITIC Securities and Morgan Stanley did not reply to a Reuters request for comment on the advisory role and restructuring of Sinopec Marketing.

Sinopec Marketing was valued at about $58 billion when it sold a 30 percent stake to a group of 25 investors for $17.5 billion in 2014 in what was hailed at the time as the country's biggest privatisation since President Xi Jinping came to power.

The company operates fuel stations and more than 23,000 convenience stores around the country.

FACTBOX-China's new crude importers - Reuters News

{{20170104T035908.663+0000}}FACTBOX-China's new crude importersBEIJING, Jan 4 (Reuters) - China has granted Shandong-based independent
refinery Rizhao Landbridge Port Petrochemical Co 1.8 million tonnes per year
preliminary crude import quota, China Petroleum & Chemical Industry Federation
said on Wednesday.

The approval came as China's small, independent refiners are set to raise
their crude oil imports again in 2017 on expectations that Beijing will keep
their intake quotas steady, market participants said. [nL4N1DW2PT]

China has given final and preliminary approvals to roughly 1.8 million
barrels per day (bpd) in crude oil import quotas, as part of efforts to reform
the industry, boost competition and attract private investment.

More than 20 refiners - 18 in the coastal province of Shandong - have
either applied for or been granted quotas for the use of imported crude oil.

Separately, the commerce ministry said in July 2015 that China will allow
more refiners to apply for import licences.

The government has promised to open up the crude import business, which has
long been dominated by state oil giants - Sinopec <0386.HK> and PetroChina
<0857.HK>.

Under new rules issued in February 2015 by the National Development and
Reform Commission, the country's state planner, smaller refiners can gain
permission to use imported crude oil if they meet certain environmental
conditions, including the closure of old and polluting refining capacity.

An official with China Petroleum and Chemical Federation, a semi-official
agency involved in national quota policy,  estimated a total of 50 million
tonnes of annual crude processing capacity has been phased out so far.

Following is a list of refiners that have been granted approval from the
NDRC for imported crude oil quotas and import licenses.

Figures are in millions of tonnes per annum.
