{{20171109T033651.528+0000}}UPDATE 1-Chinese companies agree to develop LNG in Alaska as Trump visits(Updating to add details in paragraphs 5 and 6)

BEIJING, Nov 9 (Reuters) - China's top state oil major Sinopec, one of the country's top banks and its sovereign wealth fund have agreed to help develop Alaska's liquefied natural gas sector as part of U.S. President Donald Trump's visit, the U.S. government said on Thursday.

Alaska Gasline Development Corp (AGDC), the State of Alaska, Sinopec <601988.SS>, China Investment Corp [CIC.UL] and the Bank of China <601988.SS> have signed an agreement to advance (LNG) in Alaska, the U.S. government said in an email.

The agreement will involve investment of up to $43 billion, create up to 12,000 U.S. jobs during construction, reduce the trade deficit between the United States and Asia by $10 billion a year, and give China clean energy, it said.

There were no other details.

AGDC is building a gas treatment plant, an 800-mile (1,287 km) pipeline to south central Alaska for in-state use, and a liquefaction plant in Nikiski to produce up to 20 million tons of LNG per year for export. [nL2N1N10A5]

China, the world's third-largest gas buyer, is importing more LNG as the government tries to wean the country off dirty coal as part of its push to clear the skies, while the United States wants to sell more of its excess gas abroad.

Stepping on the gas: China's truckers scramble to meet LNG demand - Reuters News

{{20171107T073001.689+0000}}Stepping on the gas: China's truckers scramble to meet LNG demandBy Chen Aizhu

CAOFEIDIAN, China, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Li Ruipeng's phone has been ringing off the hook with factories and hotels looking to get their hands on prompt supplies of gas.

"Orders started to shoot up from September. Some are asking for deliveries the very next day," said Li, a manager with privately run Huapu Gas, which delivers super-chilled gas by truck to customers within a 500-km (310 mile) radius of its base in Tangshan, east of Beijing.

Huapu is one of a fast-growing band of trucking companies that are transforming China's once-sleepy domestic spot market for gas into a unique and bustling business as Beijing pushes to wean the country off coal.

Hotels, hospitals and factories have been forced to swap their coal-fired boilers for gas ones this year, creating thousands of new standalone gas customers thirsty for the clean fuel. [nL4N1MU1BU]

But with inadequate pipelines and storage tanks, users in the world's second-largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) importer are scrambling for supplies of imported and locally produced gas from dealers like Li.

He's currently dispatching nearly 40 trailers a day, each carrying 20 metric tonnes of LNG. That's double the number six months ago, with customers lured by quick delivery and the chance to bypass higher government-set prices for pipeline gas.

"Inflexible pricing for pipeline gas, insufficient grid network and lack of storage facilities ... make trucked LNG a unique business in China," said Chen Zhu, managing director of consultancy SIA Energy.

TRAILER BREAK

The trend is a major break from the global industry norm, where buyers and sellers are locked into long-term contracts - some as long as 20 years - and rely on pipeline grids to deliver the fuel.

China's first gas trailer hit the road in 2003 as trucks run by companies like Guanghui Energy <600256.SS> travelled for over a week to ship gas from remote northwestern onshore fields to factories 5,000 kms (3,000 miles) to the south.

Now, Li and his peers are expected to play a critical role in keeping the world's most populous nation fueled this winter as it embarks on an experiment to heat homes in nearly 30 northern cities with gas.

The additional demand has boosted spot gas prices over the past month and industrial users have struggled to get their hands on supplies. [nL4N1N13WH] [nL4N1N91MY]

Gas hauled by trailers could make up a tenth of China's total gas consumption of around 240 billion cubic metres (bcm) in 2017, compared with 5.6 percent in 2014, said Chen.

And China aims to lift gas to supply 15 percent of its total energy demand by 2030, more than double the current 6 percent.

CHILLED AND LOADED

Much of the fast-paced dealmaking for spot LNG is unique to China, with Li closing deals on the phone based on prices published by industry monitors on the popular Wechat messaging platform.

A specialist in delivering imported gas, his company secures gas under an annual contract with a nearby CNOOC-operated LNG terminal in Tianjin and also spot cargoes from Caofeidian, supplying customers by trailers loaded with 13-metre long tanks storing the chilled gas.

Gas distributors like the country's largest player ENN Energy Holdings <2688.HK> and niche dealers like Huapu have spent heavily this year expanding their fleet of trailers, each costing nearly a million yuan ($150,300).

Zhangjiagang-based cryogenic equipment maker Santum, controlled by CIMC Enric <3899.HK>, the country's top producer of LNG trailers, sold 600 vehicles in the first nine months of this year, up from 410 in all of 2016.

"We've got yet another 580 trailers ordered for the rest of the year, but realistically we could only deliver those by next March," said a marketing manager with Santum, who estimated some 9,000 trailers now roam the country's highways.

IMPORTS SOAR

Surging spot LNG prices amid concerns about winter demand have drawn in rare shipments from as far as Norway and the United States. [nL2N1MN0A5]

During a recent visit to PetroChina's <0857.HK> gas import terminal at Caofeidian, a district of Tangshan, trailers lined up in a sprawling car park hours before an LNG vessel from Australia docked at the jetty.

A key receiving point for imported gas, trucked LNG sales from Caofeidian soared to 480 million cubic metres by mid-October, already up sixfold from all of 2016, according to PetroChina Jintang LNG Co Ltd which operates the terminal.

"We had to double our staffing for the pump stations and work shifts to fill the trucks," said Gu Wenwen, office manager for PetroChina Jingtang LNG.

Li, whose company plans to double its fleet of trailers, says business will only become more frenzied.

"I am talking so frequently on my phone of the transactions even my five-year daughter knows about LNG prices!" he said.

GRAPHIC-As China faces winter gas crunch, LNG prices soar - Reuters News

{{20171103T063103.848+0000}}GRAPHIC-As China faces winter gas crunch, LNG prices soar* In unusual move, LNG spot prices jump above oil-linked prices

* China's huge gasification programme sends imports soaring

* China's LNG imports expected to hit new record this winter

By Henning Gloystein and Meng Meng

SINGAPORE/BEIJING, Nov 3 (Reuters) - China is hoovering up liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargoes worldwide, pushing spot prices for the fuel above those for oil-indexed cargoes, as energy providers scramble to avoid a looming winter supply crunch.

China has moved millions of households from burning dirty coal to natural gas this year, pushing up import demand amid an already tightening overall Asian market. [nL2N1M80BL]

Most Asian LNG supplies are delivered under long-term contracts with prices linked to crude oil.

But with the upcoming winter heating season, Chinese utilities have turned to the spot market in desperation to cover themselves in order to meet surging demand, chartering tankers from as far away as Norway. [nL2N1MN0A5][nL4N1MO1MM]

"We expect (China's national oil and gas majors) CNOOC, PetroChina <601857.SS>, and Sinopec <600028.SS> to buy 30 percent more (LNG) on the spot market in the coming three months compared with last year, to help boost supplies," said Jiang Jin, gas analyst at JLC Energy.

"LNG terminals are running at full capacity," she added.

A similar short-term supply crunch late last year boosted spot Asian LNG prices by more than 80 in the last four months of the year, and pushed China's December 2016 imports to a record 3.7 million tonnes, nearly double the 2016 average of just 2 million tonnes a month.

With millions more households having moved to gas since then, last year's record is expected to be smashed this year.

"The Chinese are in panic mode. They clearly underestimated the push in demand from their gasification programme. Now they are soaking up LNG spot cargoes where they can. And suppliers are happy to deliver, at a premium," said a trader with a major commodity merchant.

Asian spot LNG prices have soared by more than two-thirds since May to $9 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), above oil-linked prices of around $8 per mmBtu.

"I'm fairly certain China will break a new import record very soon and that spot prices will break through $10," the trader said, declining to be named as he is not allowed to talk about publicly pricing.

Unlike coal or oil, where China is the world's biggest importer, the country is only the number three buyer of LNG behind South Korea and Japan.

But its gasification programme is set to change that.

"Beijing reiterated its commitment to growing the share of natural gas in the domestic energy mix in the recently held 9th National Party Congress as part of a broader move to tackle air pollution," BMI Research said on Friday.

The scale of China's soaring gas demand can be seen in the major industrial province of Hebei.

"Hebei province alone needs an extra 2 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas for heating because of mandatory measures to switch industrial and residential boilers to use natural gas," JLC's Jiang said, referring to winter demand.

That's the equivalent of 870,000 tonnes of extra LNG, equal to almost a quarter of the country's total demand.

Quarter of oil refineries risk closure under climate goals -report - Reuters News

{{20171102T000101.058+0000}}Quarter of oil refineries risk closure under climate goals -report* Refining profits to shrivel as demand drops, report says

* Sector faces heavy over capacity -Carbon Tracker

* Targets to reduce carbon emissions however seem distant

By Ron Bousso

LONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - A quarter of the world's oil refineries risk closure by 2035 if governments meet targets to limit fossil fuel burning in the fight against global warming, a report released on Thursday said.

A surge in electric vehicle sales and higher efficiency in internal combustion and jet engines are expected to slow demand growth for fuels such as gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel in the coming decades, potentially putting pressure on refining profits.

At the same time, governments around the world are set to introduce legislation in the coming years to limit emissions of heat-capturing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in order to meet targets set at a U.N-backed Paris conference in 2015.

As a result, companies such as Chevron , Royal Dutch Shell , France' Total and China's largest refiner Sinopec could see profits from refining drop by 70 percent or more over the period, according to the report co-authored by environment thinktank Carbon Tracker, Swedish investment fund AP7 and Danish pension fund PKA.

The study is based on the International Energy Agency's 450 Scenario to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius under which oil demand declines by 23 percent between 2020 and 2035.

Under this scenario, despite new refinery additions in Asia and the Middle East, only 62 percent of global capacity will be required to meet demand compared with around 80 percent today. Profits from converting crude oil into refined products will also shrink.

That in turn means that approximately one quarter of the 2016 refining capacity, the equivalent of some 24.7 million barrels per day of oil demand, will need to be closed, the report said.

The closures would likely be more pronounced in developed economies where oil demand is expected to peak earlier than in developing economies. Also, modern, complex refineries that can produce more high quality and cleaner fuels are likely to fare better than older plants.

"The consequences of achieving a 2 degree Celsius world are far more detrimental to the refining sector than the upstream sector, as it results in structural over-capacity and associated poor refining margin environment, which can only be addressed by sustained capacity rationalisation," said Alan Gelder, vice president for research at Edinburgh-based consultancy Wood Mackenzie which took part in the report.

Meeting the emission reduction targets however seems distant today. A report published on Tuesday said global emissions are set to be 30 percent higher than the target needed by 2030.[nL8N1N640X]

While oil companies including Shell have acknowledged that demand for some fuels such as gasoline could peak by the end of the 2020s, they expect demand for oil to remain strong for decades from heavy transport, aviation and chemical production.

The authors of the report estimate that overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for refiners could fall by over 50 percent by 2035 from around $147 billion in 2015.

"We consider that prospective investors should be wary of all new refinery investments," the report said.

"When demand growth stalls and turns negative, new investments will carry the risk of failing to earn an adequate return."

Carbon Tracker and a group of investors warned in a report earlier this year that oil giants risk spending trillions by 2025 on oil and gas projects that won't be feasible under the international climate targets. [nL8N1JI1P9]

China issues 5 mln T fuel quotas in fifth release this year -sources - Reuters News

{{20171101T093926.587+0000}}China issues 5 mln T fuel quotas in fifth release this year -sourcesBEIJING/SINGAPORE, Nov 1 (Reuters) - China has approved five million tonnes of fuel export quotas for the rest of 2017 in the fifth release this year after refiners asked for additional permits to ship out surplus fuels, three traders with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.

The quotas will bring the total of permits this year to about 42.5 million tonnes, roughly 12 percent more than the actual exports of gasoline, diesel and jet kerosene combined for last year.

Of the total, CNPC wins about 2.2 million tonnes, Sinopec 1.3 million tonnes, CNOOC 1.2 million tonnes and Sinochem 300,000 tonnes, the traders said.

One trader said 60 percent of the quotas were allotted to diesel, the rest to gasoline and jet kerosene.

The Ministry of Commerce did not immediately comment. Neither did CNPC, CNOOC, Sinopec or Sinochem.

(Refiles to fix punctuation in third, fifth and sixth paragraphs, and to fix mispelling of "Cheniere Energy" in third paragraph.)

By Gina Chon

WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Finance services firms look sidelined as the White House focuses on finding easy China wins. Energy and industrial companies like General Electric will have a chance to cozy up to Beijing's new leadership during U.S. President Donald Trump's upcoming Asia trip, but Wall Street isn't coming along. The U.S. business delegation's composition reflects Trump's desires to find low-hanging fruit deals to tout domestically, but low expectations for deeper concessions.

Trump arrives in Beijing next Wednesday, and the administration has been on the hunt for announcements that would make for photo ops or press releases during his visit. Companies applying to join a business delegation were queried on whether they had deals with China in the works that they could unveil while overseas, people familiar with the matter told Breakingviews. Billions of dollars in sales and investments benefitting the United States are expected. For example, one of the stars of the show will probably be Sinopec's <0386.HK> <600028.SS> 700-mile pipeline deal in Texas and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which could be worth about $7 billion in investments.

U.S. corporate delegates include GE, Honeywell , Thermo Fisher and Cheniere Energy . They arrive at an opportune time to meet Chinese leaders, who just wrapped up a major party congress and rolled out new leadership slate at the end of October.

However, the United States remains locked in contentious talks over improving market access for American firms in the People's Republic, including financial services. A senior administration official said Tuesday that progress has become more difficult. China is retrenching under President Xi Jinping, who has shown scant respect for market-based principles.

While there have been some advances on raising ownership equity caps in financial services, a deal has not been finalized, and the lack of representation by big names like Citi or Goldman Sachs on this trip suggests no major compromise is nigh. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said he hoped the one-off deals don't overshadow the need to push for structural changes.

Convincing Beijing to expose its domestic financial industry to more foreign competition is a tougher pitch than selling goods. The Trump administration is not indifferent to the financial sector's concerns, but low expectations for photo-op concessions have kept the industry at the back of the line this time around.

CONTEXT NEWS

- U.S. President Donald Trump will begin his 12-day Asia trip on Nov. 3, with scheduled stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam, and the Philippines. North Korea and economic relations are expected to be the main topics of discussion during the visit.

- Among the companies listed as participating in the delegation to China are General Electric, Honeywell, Thermo Fisher and Cherniere Energy. The Trump administration also hopes to announce a 700-mile pipeline deal with China Petroleum & Chemical Corp., known as Sinopec, in Texas and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The firm is expected to partner with Massachusetts-based ArcLight Capital and Connecticut-based Freepoint Commodities.

UPDATE 2-China's bold gas plan may threaten winter power supplies  - Reuters News

{{20171019T082741.579+0000}}UPDATE 2-China's bold gas plan may threaten winter power supplies * Underlines growing concerns about pipeline capacity

* Millions of homes to be heated by gas for first time

* Fraction of long-term storage needed has been built

(Adds comments from analysts, details throughout.)

By Josephine Mason and Chen Aizhu

BEIJING, Oct 19 (Reuters) - China has ordered state oil companies to speed up the construction of pipelines to move natural gas to homes and factories, underscoring worries that the country's insufficient infrastructure could cause power outages during the peak winter demand period.

This winter, millions of homes across the colder northern regions of the world's second-largest economy will be heated for the first time by gas rather than coal, as part of Beijing's effort to boost clean fuel use.

But with just a month before newly installed radiators get switched on, the National Development & Reform Commission (NDRC) warned on Thursday that supply and demand conditions could be "serious" this winter.

The alert shows Beijing is trying to head off supply disruptions during the peak demand period from November until March. Residential users with their radiators will have supply priority over industrial users, increasing the possibility of power losses during gas shortages.

"We are all quite concerned with supply shortages this winter ... as we may not have the infrastructure capacity to catch up with the demand growth," said Li Wei, a vice president of Kunlun Energy <0135.HK>, which operates liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and gas production plants.

Wood Mackenzie estimates the heating needs alone will add 10 billion cubic metres (bcm) to China's gas demand, the equivalent of Vietnam's annual consumption. The country is expected to use about 230 bcm this year. [nL4N1L505H]

Small industrial users like hospitals have also had to switch to gas this winter.

China will either need to ramp up imports, offering a boon for major exporters like Russia, or big industrial consumers may get interrupted, warned Kerry Anne Shanks, head of Asia gas and LNG research at consultants Wood Mackenzie.[nL4N1MO1MM] [nL2N1MN0A5]

"This depends on weather. (But) we worry that China doesn't have enough storage," she said.

China has only 8 bcm of gas storage capacity, or about 4 percent of its demand. That is much lower than other gas-using regions like the United States and Europe, which typically store about 15 percent to 25 percent of their annual needs, she said.

IT'S ALL ABOUT THE WEATHER

Winter weather will be the main factor for demand and forecast models are not yet clear.

While long-range forecasts point to a slightly warmer-than-average winter in the major cities of Beijing and Shanghai, the forecasts show that conditions until December are likely to be unusually cold.

Colder weather later in the season would be more challenging because it is harder to pull gas from storage when the tanks are emptier, Shanks said.

Specifically, the NDRC said on Thursday that Sinopec and PetroChina <601857.SS> should be injecting gas into their storage facilities ahead of the peak demand season. Their facilities should be running at full capacity.

The government also called on Sinopec to speed up the construction of four pipeline projects: a Tianjin to Beijing pipeline; a Qingdao to Nanjing project; an Inner Mongolia to Hebei development and one from Xinjiang to other regions.

It has also urged top pipeline operator China National Petroleum Corp [CNPET.UL] <601857.SS> to complete the fourth leg of its Shaanxi to Beijing line by the end of October. [nL3N1H03UP]

China expects that gas demand will rise to between 320 and 360 bcm per year by 2020, meaning more long-term infrastructure investment is needed.

The increase is the equivalent of the annual consumption of Japan, Asia's second-largest gas consumer after China.

RPT-China's CEFC eyes big league with Rosneft oil offtake deal - Reuters News

* CEFC to buy 11-13 MT/yr crude from Rosneft, starting 2018

* Offtake deal signed in Sept with Rosneft stake buy

* Deal to reduce Rosneft supplies to Trafigura, others

By Chen Aizhu and Olga Yagova

BEIJING/MOSCOW, Oct 17 (Reuters) - As part of its recent $9.1 billion investment in Russian oil giant Rosneft , little-known CEFC China Energy will have access to up to 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Russian oil - giving it the sort of market clout to potentially challenge dominant Western oil traders like Vitol.

For China, the world's top crude importer, having access to Russian oil would be a big step towards its ambition to create a globally integrated oil supply chain.

The CEFC deal comes in parallel to a Chinese offer to buy a 5 percent stake in Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest crude oil exporter. [nL8N1MR4PA]

CEFC announced plans last month to buy a stake of more than 14 percent in Rosneft, the world's largest listed oil producer, from a consortium of Glencore and the Qatar Investment Authority. [nL8N1LP3BW]

Rosneft declined comment on the matter, but a CEFC spokesman said on Tuesday that under the agreement Rosneft agreed to sell the Chinese firm 11-13 million tonnes of Russian crude a year, starting in 2018.

That equates to 220,000-260,000 bpd, about 5 percent of Rosneft's output and a quarter of China's monthly imports from Russia.

The offtake deal would eventually rise to 42 million tonnes (840,000 bpd), which CEFC will get through its equity investment.

Beyond extending Russia's lead over Saudi Arabia as China's top oil supplier, the deal will also catapult CEFC, a hitherto little-known and secretive fuel trader, into a top-10 global oil merchant.

Several people within CEFC have said the company one day hopes to rival Vitol, the world's leading oil trader that deals more than 7-8 million bpd.

Over the past year, CEFC has invested in oil concessions in Chad and Abu Dhabi. [nL3N1BL3RA] [nL8N1G51ZY]

CEFC says on its website its management model fuses "entrepreneurship, Confucianism, and military-style regimentation".

BELT AND ROAD

CEFC's tie-up with Rosneft is also seen as a strategic deal that fits Beijing's ambitious Belt and Road trade route initiative. [nL4N1ME1S9]

The cooperation between the two firms extends across the oil and gas supply chain, the CEFC spokesman said.

"The current focus is on upstream oil and gas resources, including exploration and production. The next step will be to bring these resources to China and to develop together, with Rosneft, petrochemical production, further extending the supply chain," he said.

The offtake, signed with the stake purchase agreement last month, is subject to approval by the Rosneft board. That could take place next month, the CEFC spokesman said.

To handle the new oil business, Shanghai-based CEFC, established just 15 years ago, is expanding its trading team, including in Singapore, Asia's oil trading hub.

Led by 41-year-old entrepreneur Ye Jianming, CEFC aims to eventually build a global trading team of over 100, with offices in Singapore, Hong Kong, London and the United States, said a senior person familiar with the plan. [nL4N117362] It already has a European base in Prague.

The terms of the offtake have drawn notice among international traders, who say it could reduce the amount of Russian Eastern Siberia–Pacific Ocean (ESPO) crude grade available to third parties, such as Trafigura which takes 60 percent of seaborne ESPO.

ESPO is one of the most actively traded crude oils in Asia, and is popular among Chinese refiners.

Underscoring a commitment to its home market, the CEFC spokesman said the company will prioritise sales to China, while some of the Urals crude, which it will also receive, will be sold to Chinese refineries in Europe.

CEFC will market about half the supply via term contracts with Chinese independent plants and the trading arms of state oil majors - Sinopec's <0386.HK> Unipec and China National Petroleum Corp's Chinaoil - said the senior source, with the rest sold on the spot market.

"CEFC is no longer the same CEFC it was in 2012-13 when it was a small trader of mixed aromatics .... It has upgraded," said a Beijing-based executive at a global trading house.

* Sinopec, PetroChina offer to buy up to 5 percent of Aramco

* Would offer Riyadh flexibility as it considers options

* Aramco says multiple IPO options still being studied

* South Korea and Japan also look to invest in Aramco

By Rania El Gamal and Alex Lawler

DUBAI/LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - China is offering to buy up to 5 percent of Saudi Aramco directly, sources said, a move that could give Saudi Arabia the flexibility to consider various options for its plan to float the world's biggest oil producer on the stock market.

Chinese state-owned oil companies PetroChina <0857.HK> and Sinopec <0386.HK> have written to Saudi Aramco in recent weeks to express an interest in a direct deal, industry sources told Reuters. The companies are part of a state-run consortium including China's sovereign wealth fund, the sources say.

Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said last year the kingdom was considering listing about 5 percent of Aramco in 2018 in a deal that could raise $100 billion, if the company is valued at about $2 trillion as hoped.

"The Chinese want to secure oil supplies," one of the industry sources said. "They are willing to take the whole 5 percent, or even more, alone."

PetroChina and Sinopec declined to comment.

The initial public offering (IPO) of Saudi Aramco is the centrepiece of an economic reform plan to diversify the Saudi economy beyond oil and it would also provide a welcome boost to the kingdom's budget which has been hit by low oil prices.

But the IPO plan has created public misgivings that Riyadh is relinquishing its crown jewels to foreigners cheaply at a time of low oil prices. Some Aramco employees would like the whole idea to be shelved, sources say. [nL5N1FX00A]

Internal disagreements between what some advisers recommend and what the crown prince wants have delayed several key decisions about the IPO, industry sources said. [nL5N1KX2JV] [nL5N1M122I]

The sources also point to disagreements between senior government officials, with some pushing only to list Aramco locally or to delay the IPO beyond 2018 when they hope oil prices will have stabilised at $55 to $60 a barrel.

"A range of options, for the public listing of Saudi Aramco, continue to be held under active review. No decision has been made and the IPO process remains on track," said a Saudi Aramco spokesman.

Industry sources said the sale of a significant stake to Chinese firms was one of several options being considered by the kingdom as it weighs the benefits of a public listing.

One option includes selling some stock immediately to so-called cornerstone investors, such as China, and then selling shares on the local bourse as well as an international stock exchange, with New York, London and Hong Kong in the running.

Two senior industry sources said Riyadh was keen on China, its biggest buyer of oil, becoming a cornerstone investor in Aramco. But no decision has yet been taken on whether to accept China's offer, or how much stock could be offered to cornerstone investors, the sources said.

China is creating a consortium made up of state-owned oil firms, banks and its sovereign wealth fund to act as a cornerstone investor in the IPO, people with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters in April. [nL3N1HR49S]

Sources told Reuters on Friday that Saudi Aramco was now evaluating a private placement of shares to a Chinese investor as a precursor to an international IPO, which could be delayed beyond 2018. [nL4N1MO563]

But allowing China to buy 5 percent would effectively mean cancelling the IPO altogether, which is an unlikely outcome, one of the sources said.

Sources said postponing the listing would be the least preferred option, given the preparations that have been already done and the determination of Prince Mohammed, who is expected to be the next king, to proceed with the listing.

Two sources told Reuters that sovereign wealth funds from South Korea and Japan, which are also major buyers of Saudi oil, were also interested in acquiring a stake in Aramco.

One of the sources said Russia's sovereign wealth fund RDIF was keen to invest in the Aramco IPO too.

Any alliance between Saudi Arabia and China could go beyond the purchase of a stake in Aramco and also include a reciprocal move by the Saudi company to invest in the Chinese refining industry, according to industry sources.

That would fit in with a push by the world's top oil exporter to regain its dominance in supplying China, the world's second largest oil consumer after the United States, having lost the upper hand to Russia this year. [nL4N1M227M]

Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said in August that he expected to finalise a deal with PetroChina early next year to invest in the Yunnan oil refinery in China's southwest that started operations in July. [nL8N1L94F3]

Such a move would help Aramco secure a share of crude supply starting in 2018 to the plant, which processes 260,000 barrels of oil a day (bpd). [nL4N1M227M]

Talks are focusing on finalising the size of the investment and getting final approval from Aramco's board for the valuation of the Yunnan venture, industry sources said.

Saudi exports could also receive a boost through a separate supply pact with the state-run China National Offshore Oil Corp which is starting a new 200,000 (bpd) plant in southern China. [nL4N1E91Z2] [nL4N1MK0RM]

By Rania El Gamal and Alex Lawler

DUBAI/LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - China is offering to buy up to 5 percent of Saudi Aramco directly, sources said, a move that could give Saudi Arabia the flexibility to consider various options for its plan to float the world's biggest oil producer on the stock market.

Chinese state-owned oil companies PetroChina <0857.HK> and Sinopec <0386.HK> have written to Saudi Aramco in recent weeks to express an interest in a direct deal, industry sources told Reuters. The companies are part of a state-run consortium including China's sovereign wealth fund, the sources say.

Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said last year the kingdom was considering listing about 5 percent of Aramco in 2018 in a deal that could raise $100 billion, if the company is valued at about $2 trillion as hoped.

"The Chinese want to secure oil supplies," one of the industry sources said. "They are willing to take the whole 5 percent, or even more, alone."

PetroChina and Sinopec declined to comment.

The initial public offering (IPO) of Saudi Aramco is the centrepiece of an economic reform plan to diversify the Saudi economy beyond oil and it would also provide a welcome boost to the kingdom's budget which has been hit by low oil prices.

But the IPO plan has created public misgivings that Riyadh is relinquishing its crown jewels to foreigners cheaply at a time of low oil prices. Some Aramco employees would like the whole idea to be shelved, sources say. [nL5N1FX00A]

Internal disagreements between what some advisers recommend and what the crown prince wants have delayed several key decisions about the IPO, industry sources said. [nL5N1KX2JV] [nL5N1M122I]

The sources also point to disagreements between senior government officials, with some pushing only to list Aramco locally or to delay the IPO beyond 2018 when they hope oil prices will have stabilised at $55 to $60 a barrel.

"A range of options, for the public listing of Saudi Aramco, continue to be held under active review. No decision has been made and the IPO process remains on track," said a Saudi Aramco spokesman.

Industry sources said the sale of a significant stake to Chinese firms was one of several options being considered by the kingdom as it weighs the benefits of a public listing.

One option includes selling some stock immediately to so-called cornerstone investors, such as China, and then selling shares on the local bourse as well as an international stock exchange, with New York, London and Hong Kong in the running.

BREAKINGVIEWS-China is third-best option for Saudi Aramco - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20171016T145032.650+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-China is third-best option for Saudi Aramco(Updates to include new details on potential Chinese investors in first and fourth paragraphs and Context News. The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By John Foley

LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Saudi Aramco's initial public offering is a nice-to-have, easily mistaken for a must-have. A consortium of Chinese companies including oil producers PetroChina <601857.SS> and Sinopec <600028.SS> has offered to buy 5 percent of the company directly, sources told Reuters, as its international listing hangs in the balance. The benefits for Saudi Arabia of an Aramco IPO, though, are not to be found in Beijing.

Companies usually list their shares on a public exchange to get cash, growth, influence or discipline. Selling 5 percent of Aramco at its owner's preferred valuation of $2 trillion would certainly bring in cash; selling a slice to a sovereign investor would bring in somewhat less. That said, Saudi doesn't urgently need the money. Though its foreign exchange reserves have been falling – the $488 billion war chest at the end of August is one-third smaller than three years ago – that's still nearly five times what the International Monetary Fund considers the "adequate" level. If the goal were to raise money quickly, Saudi could simply sell some of its vast oil reserves.

As for influence, China offers some. But it will want something in return, like help getting more oil priced in its own currency, the yuan. A global stock offering would do more to open up financial channels that Crown Prince Mohammed bin-Salman can tap to finance his grand diversification of Saudi's economy away from the black stuff. At $100 billion, it would also divert liquidity from regional rivals like Iran that also hope to attract global capital.

Perhaps the best case for listing Aramco internationally is to improve discipline at the company itself. China shows that can work. The country's state-owned enterprises, including both the oil companies now offering to buy Aramco equity, put their affairs in better order than they would otherwise have been to court global capitalists. But a Chinese investor is unlikely to demand as much transparency as a global pension fund or a Western private equity investor.

So why even consider selling a stake to China? The answer might be momentum. Carving off a slice of Aramco – however small – at a theoretical valuation of $2 trillion would help to keep that doubtful number alive, and give the impression of movement towards the Crown Prince's ultimate goal. But compared with a full listing at a more realistic valuation, or simply bringing in a wider raft of institutional investors, it sounds like a third-best option.

CONTEXT NEWS

- China has offered to buy 5 percent of Saudi Aramco directly, as plans for an international listing are pushed back from an original 2018 target, sources told Reuters.

- Aramco, the state oil producer of Saudi Arabia, is considering a dual listing on its home market and another, as yet undecided exchange, with New York, London and Asian markets competing for the offering.

- The would-be buyers of the stake include Chinese oil producers PetroChina and Sinopec, as well as China's sovereign wealth fund, Reuters reported.

- Crown Prince Mohammed bin-Salman has given Aramco a putative valuation of $2 trillion, suggesting a listing of a 5 percent stake would raise $100 billion.

- The Crown Prince is behind a plan called "Vision 2030" that seeks to transform Saudi's economy through support for small businesses, privatisation, the creation of a huge sovereign wealth fund and diversification away from oil revenue dependence.

UPDATE 2-China's bold gas plan may threaten winter power supplies  - Reuters News

{{20171019T082741.579+0000}}UPDATE 2-China's bold gas plan may threaten winter power supplies * Underlines growing concerns about pipeline capacity

* Millions of homes to be heated by gas for first time

* Fraction of long-term storage needed has been built

(Adds comments from analysts, details throughout.)

By Josephine Mason and Chen Aizhu

BEIJING, Oct 19 (Reuters) - China has ordered state oil companies to speed up the construction of pipelines to move natural gas to homes and factories, underscoring worries that the country's insufficient infrastructure could cause power outages during the peak winter demand period.

This winter, millions of homes across the colder northern regions of the world's second-largest economy will be heated for the first time by gas rather than coal, as part of Beijing's effort to boost clean fuel use.

But with just a month before newly installed radiators get switched on, the National Development & Reform Commission (NDRC) warned on Thursday that supply and demand conditions could be "serious" this winter.

The alert shows Beijing is trying to head off supply disruptions during the peak demand period from November until March. Residential users with their radiators will have supply priority over industrial users, increasing the possibility of power losses during gas shortages.

"We are all quite concerned with supply shortages this winter ... as we may not have the infrastructure capacity to catch up with the demand growth," said Li Wei, a vice president of Kunlun Energy <0135.HK>, which operates liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and gas production plants.

Wood Mackenzie estimates the heating needs alone will add 10 billion cubic metres (bcm) to China's gas demand, the equivalent of Vietnam's annual consumption. The country is expected to use about 230 bcm this year. [nL4N1L505H]

Small industrial users like hospitals have also had to switch to gas this winter.

China will either need to ramp up imports, offering a boon for major exporters like Russia, or big industrial consumers may get interrupted, warned Kerry Anne Shanks, head of Asia gas and LNG research at consultants Wood Mackenzie.[nL4N1MO1MM] [nL2N1MN0A5]

"This depends on weather. (But) we worry that China doesn't have enough storage," she said.

China has only 8 bcm of gas storage capacity, or about 4 percent of its demand. That is much lower than other gas-using regions like the United States and Europe, which typically store about 15 percent to 25 percent of their annual needs, she said.

IT'S ALL ABOUT THE WEATHER

Winter weather will be the main factor for demand and forecast models are not yet clear.

While long-range forecasts point to a slightly warmer-than-average winter in the major cities of Beijing and Shanghai, the forecasts show that conditions until December are likely to be unusually cold.

Colder weather later in the season would be more challenging because it is harder to pull gas from storage when the tanks are emptier, Shanks said.

Specifically, the NDRC said on Thursday that Sinopec and PetroChina <601857.SS> should be injecting gas into their storage facilities ahead of the peak demand season. Their facilities should be running at full capacity.

The government also called on Sinopec to speed up the construction of four pipeline projects: a Tianjin to Beijing pipeline; a Qingdao to Nanjing project; an Inner Mongolia to Hebei development and one from Xinjiang to other regions.

It has also urged top pipeline operator China National Petroleum Corp [CNPET.UL] <601857.SS> to complete the fourth leg of its Shaanxi to Beijing line by the end of October. [nL3N1H03UP]

China expects that gas demand will rise to between 320 and 360 bcm per year by 2020, meaning more long-term infrastructure investment is needed.

The increase is the equivalent of the annual consumption of Japan, Asia's second-largest gas consumer after China.

* CEFC to buy 11-13 MT/yr crude from Rosneft, starting 2018

* Offtake deal signed in Sept with Rosneft stake buy

* Deal to reduce Rosneft supplies to Trafigura, others

By Chen Aizhu and Olga Yagova

BEIJING/MOSCOW, Oct 17 (Reuters) - As part of its recent $9.1 billion investment in Russian oil giant Rosneft , little-known CEFC China Energy will have access to up to 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Russian oil - giving it the sort of market clout to potentially challenge dominant Western oil traders like Vitol.

For China, the world's top crude importer, having access to Russian oil would be a big step towards its ambition to create a globally integrated oil supply chain.

The CEFC deal comes in parallel to a Chinese offer to buy a 5 percent stake in Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest crude oil exporter. [nL8N1MR4PA]

CEFC announced plans last month to buy a stake of more than 14 percent in Rosneft, the world's largest listed oil producer, from a consortium of Glencore and the Qatar Investment Authority. [nL8N1LP3BW]

Rosneft declined comment on the matter, but a CEFC spokesman said on Tuesday that under the agreement Rosneft agreed to sell the Chinese firm 11-13 million tonnes of Russian crude a year, starting in 2018.

That equates to 220,000-260,000 bpd, about 5 percent of Rosneft's output and a quarter of China's monthly imports from Russia.

The offtake deal would eventually rise to 42 million tonnes (840,000 bpd), which CEFC will get through its equity investment.

Beyond extending Russia's lead over Saudi Arabia as China's top oil supplier, the deal will also catapult CEFC, a hitherto little-known and secretive fuel trader, into a top-10 global oil merchant.

Several people within CEFC have said the company one day hopes to rival Vitol, the world's leading oil trader that deals more than 7-8 million bpd.

Over the past year, CEFC has invested in oil concessions in Chad and Abu Dhabi. [nL3N1BL3RA] [nL8N1G51ZY]

CEFC says on its website its management model fuses "entrepreneurship, Confucianism, and military-style regimentation".

BELT AND ROAD

CEFC's tie-up with Rosneft is also seen as a strategic deal that fits Beijing's ambitious Belt and Road trade route initiative. [nL4N1ME1S9]

The cooperation between the two firms extends across the oil and gas supply chain, the CEFC spokesman said.

"The current focus is on upstream oil and gas resources, including exploration and production. The next step will be to bring these resources to China and to develop together, with Rosneft, petrochemical production, further extending the supply chain," he said.

The offtake, signed with the stake purchase agreement last month, is subject to approval by the Rosneft board. That could take place next month, the CEFC spokesman said.

To handle the new oil business, Shanghai-based CEFC, established just 15 years ago, is expanding its trading team, including in Singapore, Asia's oil trading hub.

Led by 41-year-old entrepreneur Ye Jianming, CEFC aims to eventually build a global trading team of over 100, with offices in Singapore, Hong Kong, London and the United States, said a senior person familiar with the plan. [nL4N117362] It already has a European base in Prague.

The terms of the offtake have drawn notice among international traders, who say it could reduce the amount of Russian Eastern Siberia–Pacific Ocean (ESPO) crude grade available to third parties, such as Trafigura which takes 60 percent of seaborne ESPO.

ESPO is one of the most actively traded crude oils in Asia, and is popular among Chinese refiners.

Underscoring a commitment to its home market, the CEFC spokesman said the company will prioritise sales to China, while some of the Urals crude, which it will also receive, will be sold to Chinese refineries in Europe.

CEFC will market about half the supply via term contracts with Chinese independent plants and the trading arms of state oil majors - Sinopec's <0386.HK> Unipec and China National Petroleum Corp's Chinaoil - said the senior source, with the rest sold on the spot market.

"CEFC is no longer the same CEFC it was in 2012-13 when it was a small trader of mixed aromatics .... It has upgraded," said a Beijing-based executive at a global trading house.

* Sinopec, PetroChina offer to buy up to 5 percent of Aramco

* Would offer Riyadh flexibility as it considers options

* Aramco says multiple IPO options still being studied

* South Korea and Japan also look to invest in Aramco

By Rania El Gamal and Alex Lawler

DUBAI/LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - China is offering to buy up to 5 percent of Saudi Aramco directly, sources said, a move that could give Saudi Arabia the flexibility to consider various options for its plan to float the world's biggest oil producer on the stock market.

Chinese state-owned oil companies PetroChina <0857.HK> and Sinopec <0386.HK> have written to Saudi Aramco in recent weeks to express an interest in a direct deal, industry sources told Reuters. The companies are part of a state-run consortium including China's sovereign wealth fund, the sources say.

Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said last year the kingdom was considering listing about 5 percent of Aramco in 2018 in a deal that could raise $100 billion, if the company is valued at about $2 trillion as hoped.

"The Chinese want to secure oil supplies," one of the industry sources said. "They are willing to take the whole 5 percent, or even more, alone."

PetroChina and Sinopec declined to comment.

The initial public offering (IPO) of Saudi Aramco is the centrepiece of an economic reform plan to diversify the Saudi economy beyond oil and it would also provide a welcome boost to the kingdom's budget which has been hit by low oil prices.

But the IPO plan has created public misgivings that Riyadh is relinquishing its crown jewels to foreigners cheaply at a time of low oil prices. Some Aramco employees would like the whole idea to be shelved, sources say. [nL5N1FX00A]

Internal disagreements between what some advisers recommend and what the crown prince wants have delayed several key decisions about the IPO, industry sources said. [nL5N1KX2JV] [nL5N1M122I]

The sources also point to disagreements between senior government officials, with some pushing only to list Aramco locally or to delay the IPO beyond 2018 when they hope oil prices will have stabilised at $55 to $60 a barrel.

"A range of options, for the public listing of Saudi Aramco, continue to be held under active review. No decision has been made and the IPO process remains on track," said a Saudi Aramco spokesman.

Industry sources said the sale of a significant stake to Chinese firms was one of several options being considered by the kingdom as it weighs the benefits of a public listing.

One option includes selling some stock immediately to so-called cornerstone investors, such as China, and then selling shares on the local bourse as well as an international stock exchange, with New York, London and Hong Kong in the running.

CORNERSTONE INVESTOR

Two senior industry sources said Riyadh was keen on China, its biggest buyer of oil, becoming a cornerstone investor in Aramco. But no decision has yet been taken on whether to accept China's offer, or how much stock could be offered to cornerstone investors, the sources said.

China is creating a consortium made up of state-owned oil firms, banks and its sovereign wealth fund to act as a cornerstone investor in the IPO, people with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters in April. [nL3N1HR49S]

Sources told Reuters on Friday that Saudi Aramco was now evaluating a private placement of shares to a Chinese investor as a precursor to an international IPO, which could be delayed beyond 2018. [nL4N1MO563]

But allowing China to buy 5 percent would effectively mean cancelling the IPO altogether, which is an unlikely outcome, one of the sources said.

Sources said postponing the listing would be the least preferred option, given the preparations that have been already done and the determination of Prince Mohammed, who is expected to be the next king, to proceed with the listing.

Two sources told Reuters that sovereign wealth funds from South Korea and Japan, which are also major buyers of Saudi oil, were also interested in acquiring a stake in Aramco.

One of the sources said Russia's sovereign wealth fund RDIF was keen to invest in the Aramco IPO too.

Any alliance between Saudi Arabia and China could go beyond the purchase of a stake in Aramco and also include a reciprocal move by the Saudi company to invest in the Chinese refining industry, according to industry sources.

That would fit in with a push by the world's top oil exporter to regain its dominance in supplying China, the world's second largest oil consumer after the United States, having lost the upper hand to Russia this year. [nL4N1M227M]

Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said in August that he expected to finalise a deal with PetroChina early next year to invest in the Yunnan oil refinery in China's southwest that started operations in July. [nL8N1L94F3]

Such a move would help Aramco secure a share of crude supply starting in 2018 to the plant, which processes 260,000 barrels of oil a day (bpd). [nL4N1M227M]

Talks are focusing on finalising the size of the investment and getting final approval from Aramco's board for the valuation of the Yunnan venture, industry sources said.

Saudi exports could also receive a boost through a separate supply pact with the state-run China National Offshore Oil Corp which is starting a new 200,000 (bpd) plant in southern China. [nL4N1E91Z2] [nL4N1MK0RM]

By Rania El Gamal and Alex Lawler

DUBAI/LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - China is offering to buy up to 5 percent of Saudi Aramco directly, sources said, a move that could give Saudi Arabia the flexibility to consider various options for its plan to float the world's biggest oil producer on the stock market.

Chinese state-owned oil companies PetroChina <0857.HK> and Sinopec <0386.HK> have written to Saudi Aramco in recent weeks to express an interest in a direct deal, industry sources told Reuters. The companies are part of a state-run consortium including China's sovereign wealth fund, the sources say.

Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said last year the kingdom was considering listing about 5 percent of Aramco in 2018 in a deal that could raise $100 billion, if the company is valued at about $2 trillion as hoped.

"The Chinese want to secure oil supplies," one of the industry sources said. "They are willing to take the whole 5 percent, or even more, alone."

PetroChina and Sinopec declined to comment.

The initial public offering (IPO) of Saudi Aramco is the centrepiece of an economic reform plan to diversify the Saudi economy beyond oil and it would also provide a welcome boost to the kingdom's budget which has been hit by low oil prices.

But the IPO plan has created public misgivings that Riyadh is relinquishing its crown jewels to foreigners cheaply at a time of low oil prices. Some Aramco employees would like the whole idea to be shelved, sources say. [nL5N1FX00A]

Internal disagreements between what some advisers recommend and what the crown prince wants have delayed several key decisions about the IPO, industry sources said. [nL5N1KX2JV] [nL5N1M122I]

The sources also point to disagreements between senior government officials, with some pushing only to list Aramco locally or to delay the IPO beyond 2018 when they hope oil prices will have stabilised at $55 to $60 a barrel.

"A range of options, for the public listing of Saudi Aramco, continue to be held under active review. No decision has been made and the IPO process remains on track," said a Saudi Aramco spokesman.

Industry sources said the sale of a significant stake to Chinese firms was one of several options being considered by the kingdom as it weighs the benefits of a public listing.

One option includes selling some stock immediately to so-called cornerstone investors, such as China, and then selling shares on the local bourse as well as an international stock exchange, with New York, London and Hong Kong in the running.

CORNERSTONE INVESTOR

Two senior industry sources said Riyadh was keen on China, its biggest buyer of oil, becoming a cornerstone investor in Aramco. But no decision has yet been taken on whether to accept China's offer, or how much stock could be offered to cornerstone investors, the sources said.

China is creating a consortium made up of state-owned oil firms, banks and its sovereign wealth fund to act as a cornerstone investor in the IPO, people with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters in April. [nL3N1HR49S]

Sources told Reuters on Friday that Saudi Aramco was now evaluating a private placement of shares to a Chinese investor as a precursor to an international IPO, which could be delayed beyond 2018. [nL4N1MO563]

But allowing China to buy 5 percent would effectively mean cancelling the IPO altogether, which is an unlikely outcome, one of the sources said.

Sources said postponing the listing would be the least preferred option, given the preparations that have been already done and the determination of Prince Mohammed, who is expected to be the next king, to proceed with the listing.

Two sources told Reuters that sovereign wealth funds from South Korea and Japan, which are also major buyers of Saudi oil, were also interested in acquiring a stake in Aramco.

One of the sources said Russia's sovereign wealth fund RDIF was keen to invest in the Aramco IPO too.

Any alliance between Saudi Arabia and China could go beyond the purchase of a stake in Aramco and also include a reciprocal move by the Saudi company to invest in the Chinese refining industry, according to industry sources.

That would fit in with a push by the world's top oil exporter to regain its dominance in supplying China, the world's second largest oil consumer after the United States, having lost the upper hand to Russia this year. [nL4N1M227M]

Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said in August that he expected to finalise a deal with PetroChina early next year to invest in the Yunnan oil refinery in China's southwest that started operations in July. [nL8N1L94F3]

Such a move would help Aramco secure a share of crude supply starting in 2018 to the plant, which processes 260,000 barrels of oil a day (bpd). [nL4N1M227M]

Talks are focusing on finalising the size of the investment and getting final approval from Aramco's board for the valuation of the Yunnan venture, industry sources said.

Saudi exports could also receive a boost through a separate supply pact with the state-run China National Offshore Oil Corp which is starting a new 200,000 (bpd) plant in southern China. [nL4N1E91Z2] [nL4N1MK0RM]

BREAKINGVIEWS-China is third-best option for Saudi Aramco - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20171016T145032.650+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-China is third-best option for Saudi Aramco(Updates to include new details on potential Chinese investors in first and fourth paragraphs and Context News. The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By John Foley

LONDON, Oct 16 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Saudi Aramco's initial public offering is a nice-to-have, easily mistaken for a must-have. A consortium of Chinese companies including oil producers PetroChina <601857.SS> and Sinopec <600028.SS> has offered to buy 5 percent of the company directly, sources told Reuters, as its international listing hangs in the balance. The benefits for Saudi Arabia of an Aramco IPO, though, are not to be found in Beijing.

Companies usually list their shares on a public exchange to get cash, growth, influence or discipline. Selling 5 percent of Aramco at its owner's preferred valuation of $2 trillion would certainly bring in cash; selling a slice to a sovereign investor would bring in somewhat less. That said, Saudi doesn't urgently need the money. Though its foreign exchange reserves have been falling – the $488 billion war chest at the end of August is one-third smaller than three years ago – that's still nearly five times what the International Monetary Fund considers the "adequate" level. If the goal were to raise money quickly, Saudi could simply sell some of its vast oil reserves.

As for influence, China offers some. But it will want something in return, like help getting more oil priced in its own currency, the yuan. A global stock offering would do more to open up financial channels that Crown Prince Mohammed bin-Salman can tap to finance his grand diversification of Saudi's economy away from the black stuff. At $100 billion, it would also divert liquidity from regional rivals like Iran that also hope to attract global capital.

Perhaps the best case for listing Aramco internationally is to improve discipline at the company itself. China shows that can work. The country's state-owned enterprises, including both the oil companies now offering to buy Aramco equity, put their affairs in better order than they would otherwise have been to court global capitalists. But a Chinese investor is unlikely to demand as much transparency as a global pension fund or a Western private equity investor.

So why even consider selling a stake to China? The answer might be momentum. Carving off a slice of Aramco – however small – at a theoretical valuation of $2 trillion would help to keep that doubtful number alive, and give the impression of movement towards the Crown Prince's ultimate goal. But compared with a full listing at a more realistic valuation, or simply bringing in a wider raft of institutional investors, it sounds like a third-best option.

CONTEXT NEWS

- China has offered to buy 5 percent of Saudi Aramco directly, as plans for an international listing are pushed back from an original 2018 target, sources told Reuters.

- Aramco, the state oil producer of Saudi Arabia, is considering a dual listing on its home market and another, as yet undecided exchange, with New York, London and Asian markets competing for the offering.

- The would-be buyers of the stake include Chinese oil producers PetroChina and Sinopec, as well as China's sovereign wealth fund, Reuters reported.

- Crown Prince Mohammed bin-Salman has given Aramco a putative valuation of $2 trillion, suggesting a listing of a 5 percent stake would raise $100 billion.

- The Crown Prince is behind a plan called "Vision 2030" that seeks to transform Saudi's economy through support for small businesses, privatisation, the creation of a huge sovereign wealth fund and diversification away from oil revenue dependence.

UPDATE 3-Glencore pips Sinopec to buy Chevron's South African assets - 路透新闻

{{20171006T180615.000+0000}}UPDATE 3-Glencore pips Sinopec to buy Chevron's South African assetsLONDON, Oct 6 (Reuters)

* Glencore agrees to buy assets for $973 mln

* Chevron's assets include major refinery in Cape Town

* Chevron previously agreed sale with China's Sinopec

* Glencore looking to bring in partner for the stake - source

(Adds Chevron comment in par 4)

By Julia Payne and Zandi Shabalala

LONDON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Commodities trader and miner Glencore has swooped in to replace China's Sinopec as the buyer of Chevron's South African and Botswana assets after reaching a deal with local investors.

The assets include a 100,000 barrel-per-day oil refinery in Cape Town, a lubricants plant in Durban as well as 820 petrol stations and other oil storage facilities. It also includes 220 convenience stores across South Africa and Botswana.

In its statement on Friday, Glencore said it had agreed to buy Chevron's 75 percent stake in its South African subsidiary and its Botswana interests for a combined $973 million. The remaining 25 percent stake will stay with a consortium of Black Economic Empowerment shareholders and an employee trust.

An industry source familiar with Glencore's mergers and acquisitions activities said the company was looking to bring in a partner.

A spokesman for Chevron said the company does not comment on commercial matters. Sinopec did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Glencore stepped in after local shareholders exercised pre-emption rights following delays to the Sinopec deal.

In March, Chevron announced that it had agreed the sale of its assets to China's largest refiner Sinopec <600028.SS>, <0386.HK> for nearly $1 billion. As of May, the deal had been under review by South Africa's Economic Development ministry. [nL3N1GZ3PH][nL8N1IR3QG]

Glencore was among the bidders for the stake last year along with oil major Total and rival trading house Gunvor. [nL8N1CU16Z]

END OF ERA

The stake was of keen interest to many oil traders as the retail network is one of the biggest in South Africa and it provides access to strategic storage in Saldanha Bay on the southwestern coast.

Chevron along with other oil majors have announced a flurry of downstream sales in the last few years to trim costs after global oil prices slumped in 2014.

Chevron, which has had a presence in South Africa for more than a century, announced the sale in January 2016.

Nimbler oil trading firms have snapped up the unwanted oil refineries and retail stations particularly in industrialising nations such as South Africa where young populations and a fast-growing middle class are expected to boost fuel demand. [nL5N1GN28P]

Glencore has shifted in the last year from shedding interests during the 2015-2016 commodities downturn to asset-buying since the rebound in prices. [nL5N1KM2XJ]

The deal, which will include Glencore retaining Chevron's local management team and workforce, will be funded using existing cash resources and is expected to close in mid-2018.

"Glencore intends to manage its overall oil asset portfolio to ensure that, including this transaction, net additional capital investment is limited to less than $500 million over the next 12 months," it said.

If the deal closes, this would be Glencore's first refining asset. It began expanding into downstream oil in May after setting up a retail franchise in Mexico. [nL8N1IK1R8]
