By Chen Aizhu

BEIJING, Sept 8 (Reuters) - A group of independent Chinese oil refiners is clubbing together to survive an onslaught by state-owned giants and the rise of private chemical giants, but industry analysts said the new alliance may find it hard to stick.

Less than two years after becoming some of China's newest crude oil importers, around 20 independent plants in the eastern industrial heartland of Shandong province plan to form a joint venture to coordinate their production, marketing, crude oil imports and investments. [nL4N1LL391]

The new alliance, to be called the Shandong Refining & Chemical Group, is to be headquartered in the provincial capital Jinan, and as envisioned will be an upgrade on a crude-buying federation set up in early 2016 by some of the same members.

The new group of "teapot" refiners aims to pool funds and resources to produce fuels and chemicals more efficiently as they battle stiff competition in an increasingly saturated market and under tightened environmental and tax scrutiny. [nL3N1HB3MP]

"We see the need to advance to the next stage as we face competition from both the national team and the provincial team. We can't afford operating like a plate of scattered sand," said Zhang Liucheng, a vice president of Shandong Dongming Petrochemical Group [SDHLYD.UL], one of the initiators of the stronger alliance.

The earlier crude-purchasing club was too loose an organization and did not have much success, Zhang said.

But while Shandong Dongming and fellow founding member Qingyuan Group are trying to build a more formal structure, including registering the new company as early as next week with a capitalisation of 50 billion yuan ($7.7 billion), there are few details such as a list of members and when they will start to commit funding.

Analysts said pooling the assets and coordinating the investments of 20 plants that have multiple private and local government owners will be a huge challenge.

"The new group shall have bigger political bargaining power ... but it will be hugely difficult to align all the various interests," said Harry Liu, of consultancy IHS Markit.

That was reflected in the comments of an executive of a teapot refiner that was a member of the crude buyers' club: "Each plant has its unique product lines and marketing strategies, and every new investment is a result of thorough market studies. How would you expect the new group to coordinate?"

The executive said his company was waiting to see a concrete action plan before agreeing to participate.

SEEKING BIGGER CLOUT

State-owned rivals Sinopec <600028.SS> and PetroChina <601857.SS> operate larger, more sophisticated plants, and have influence over government policies such as fuel export quotas, which are highly sought after as China's refined product output far exceeds demand. [nL4N1LH4J0] [nL3N1GN2JR]

Jiao Chong, managing director of Qingyuan Group, said the new venture could use its larger market presence to lobby the government.

The planned group would have a combined crude oil import quota of over 50 million tonnes a year, or 1 million barrels per day, an amount on par with smaller state companies like Sinochem [SASADA.UL] and China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC).

"We can become a stronger voice in lobbying for policies like fuel export quotas," Jiao said.

The need for the independent refiners to club together is heightened by the emergence of new rivals, such as provincial government-backed private chemical giants like Rongsheng Holding Group and Hengli Group [HLGRP.UL] that are building or planning refining complexes on China's eastern coast.

Rongsheng's first 400,000 bpd refinery is slated to start up as early as end-2018. [nL3N1AW3A4]

Hengli, a privately-owned chemicals producer, is building a similar-sized refining complex, industry officials said.

"New investments by the likes of Rongsheng have the integration skills and scale of production that teapots could barely rival, " said IHS' Liu.

Shandong Dongming is China's largest teapot refiner with a total operating capacity of 240,000 bpd.

RPT-Indonesia's Pertamina receives first license to export gasoil -sources - Reuters News

{{20170905T012119.039+0000}}RPT-Indonesia's Pertamina receives first license to export gasoil -sources(Repeats with no changes to text)

* Crowded retail market, lower domestic demand drives up inventory

* Licence issued 2-3 weeks ago, working on export procedures

* Pertamina still wants to focus on domestic sales

* Lobbying government to be exclusive importer of gasoil

By Jessica Jaganathan and Wilda Asmarini

SINGAPORE/JAKARTA, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Indonesia's Pertamina [PERTM.UL] has received a license from the government to export gasoil for the first time, three sources close to the matter said on Monday, although the state oil company is planning to prioritize domestic sales if possible.

Pertamina is typically an importer of gasoil, as diesel is called in most Asian markets, but inbound shipments have declined over the years as it ramped up refining output and demand from the mining sector slowed.

With other gasoil sellers - such as Royal Dutch Shell , Exxon Mobil Corp and Solaris Prima Energy - crowding into the retail market, and an increased biodiesel mandate in 2016 reducing conventional consumption, Pertamina's supply of the fuel has also outperformed demand, said Toharso, director of refineries at Pertamina, who goes by one name.

If Pertamina exports its surplus fuel, it would help ease supply tightness in Asia caused by Tropical Storm Harvey, which drove up the Asian gasoil margins to a one-and-a-half month high, traders said. [nL4N1LG30C] [nL8N1LH44K]

The company, though, is also taking steps to sell more gasoil into its domestic market by asking the government to grant it a monopoly on diesel imports, which would force the other retailers to buy from Pertamina.

The state oil company received the gasoil export license two to three weeks ago, and it is developing a standard operating procedure on how to export the cargoes, the sources said.

Still, "we will try our best to sell in the domestic market," Toto Nugroho, senior vice president at Pertamina for integrated supply chain, told Reuters.

But if market competition means storage inventories build up, "the last resort is to export," he said.

Pertamina declined to give details on possible export volumes or a timeline of shipments.

LOBBYING FOR IMPORT MONOPOLY

Pertamina supplies about 70 percent of Indonesia's gasoil needs, while private firms supply the rest, Toharso said.

Many of the private firms import their gasoil, but Pertamina is lobbying Jakarta to name it the country's exclusive importer of the fuel, a move that would alleviate the state oil company's surplus and possibly negate its need to export the fuel.

"Pertamina is encouraging the Energy Ministry to make other companies not to import gasoil and just buy it from Pertamina," said Toharso.

Indonesia's Energy Ministry did not address a Reuters query asking if it will approve Pertamina's request.

Dadan Kusdiana, a spokesman for the ministry said it will "encourage (retail) companies to purchase from Pertamina first before they import."

"Pertamina has also sent an offer letter to other (retail) companies that need gasoil," Kusdiana said.

But the prices offered by Pertamina are higher than buying from the international market, said a buyer who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak with media.

"We can easily absorb the cargoes as long as the price is competitive," the buyer said.

Toharso said the prices were negotiable.

Nearly two-thirds of Indonesia's gasoil is used in its transport sector for commercial vehicles, which is expected to grow at 3 to 5 percent this year. The rest is used in the country's industrial and mining sectors.

Solaris Prima Energy is a subsidiary of China-owned trader Unipec Singapore, whose parent company is Asia's top refiner Sinopec Corp <600028.SS>.

Sinopec half-year profit rises 41 pct to 27.1 bln yuan - Reuters News

{{20170827T091207.210+0000}}Sinopec half-year profit rises 41 pct to 27.1 bln yuanBEIJING, Aug 27 (Reuters) - China Petroleum and Chemical Corp <600028.SS> <0386.HK>, known as Sinopec, reported its best six-month profit since the second half of 2014 on Sunday, the latest Chinese state oil major to report a surge in results due to a big recovery in crude prices from last year.

The country's largest refiner reported a first-half net profit attributable to equity shareholders of 27.1 billion yuan ($4.08 billion), up 40.7 percent on a year prior, based on Chinese accounting standards. Revenue for the period rose 32.6 percent to 1.166 trillion yuan.

Profit rose 40.1 percent to 27.92 billion yuan during the period based on international accounting standards.

The company attributed the strong performance to higher prices and sales of downstream products compared to the year-earlier period.

The data comes after China's largest oil producer PetroChina <601857.SS> <0857.HK> and offshore oil and gas producer CNOOC Ltd <0883.HK> each released on Thursday their best results in years. [nL4N1LA3FD] [nL4N1LA24H]

Sinopec said it expects second half crude oil production to total 148 million barrels.

Sinopec also said it expects global oil prices to continue to fluctuate at low levels the rest of this year, while structural adjustments in China's energy sector mean natural gas demand will continue to grow quickly.

Sinopec has a larger downstream business than PetroChina, which focuses on upstream oil and gas production. But the refiner is facing headwinds from a glut in the domestic fuel market.

Total domestic fuel sales inched up 0.82 percent to 87.22 million tonnes in the first half.

Crude oil throughput rose 1.6 percent in the first six months to 117.79 million tonnes, as the pace of growth eased from 3.1 percent in the first quarter.

In a bid to reclaim market share, Sinopec and PetroChina have been involved in a pricing war in the retail fuel market since June. [nL2N1L7061] [nL3N1JC28Z]

Sinopec is also considering cutting up to 230,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude runs in the third quarter to counter weaker demand, sources said. [nL3N1JH156]

A decline in Sinopec's crude oil production eased in the first half as the company invested more in upstream exploration and production.

Sinopec's capital spending on upstream development rose to 6.87 billion yuan in the first half, compared with 5.168 billion yuan in the same period last year.

Oil services group CGG's shares surge for fourth day as bid talk lingers - Reuters News

{{20170825T075133.895+0000}}Oil services group CGG's shares surge for fourth day as bid talk lingersPARIS, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Shares in debt-ridden oil services group CGG surged for a fourth consecutive day on Friday, with traders and fund managers citing continuing speculation of a bid from China's Sinopec <600028.SS> as the main driver for the rally.

They added there was also an element of hedge funds cancelling out negative bets on CGG's shares falling in future - known as "short covering" - as contributing to the rally.

CGG shares were up 19.4 percent at 6.1 euros in early session trading, with the stock up 110 percent over the last week.

Speculation of a bid from Sinopec first surfaced at the start of the week. A CGG spokesman said on Friday that the company had no comment to make on the bid rumours.

"We're still in the same trend, namely talk of interest from Sinopec, but it's really still just speculation," said one Paris-based fund manager.

CGG shares surge for third day as bid speculation rumbles on - Reuters News

{{20170824T132956.187+0000}}CGG shares surge for third day as bid speculation rumbles onPARIS, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Shares in debt-ridden oil services group CGG surged for a third day in a row on Thursday, with traders citing continuing speculation of a bid from China's Sinopec <600028.SS> as the main driver for the stock's rally.

CGG shares were up around 38 percent in solid volumes, before trading in the stock was temporarily halted. The shares had also risen 27 percent on Aug. 23 and 14 percent on Aug 22.

"It's the same bid rumours as before," said one trader at a Geneva-based investment firm.

Speculation of a bid from Sinopec first surfaced at the start of the week. CGG has said it has no comment to make on the bid rumours.

Despite the stock's recent rally, CGG's shares remain down by 60 percent since the start of 2017.

PetroChina H1 profit best in years, beats expectations, on oil price recovery - Reuters News

{{20170824T085059.985+0000}}PetroChina H1 profit best in years, beats expectations, on oil price recoveryBEIJING, Aug 24 (Reuters) - China's largest oil producer PetroChina <601857.SS> <0857.HK> reported on Thursday its best first-half net profit in two years, buoyed by a surge in crude prices even as fuel margins narrowed due to well-supplied markets for gasoline and diesel.

PetroChina's net profit for the first half of 2017 surged to 12.7 billion yuan ($1.91 billion), up from 528 million yuan in the first half of 2016. That is the highest six-month profit since the first half of 2015.

Revenue rose to 975.9 million yuan, the highest since the second half of 2014, up from 739 million yuan in the same period last year.

Global oil prices more than doubled in the first half of 2017 from the same period a year ago, benefiting oil majors.

The numbers were better than the company's forecast of profits between 9 billion and 11 billion yuan for the first half issued in July, exceeding the results for the whole of 2016. [nL3N1KH3DC]

While profits posted a big jump year-on-year, equity analysts have warned the company is unlikely to keep the momentum into the second half of the year given the pullback in crude prices amid a continued global crude glut, even as OPEC members extended output cuts.

The company said it would issue a special dividend of 0.03809 yuan per share.

Saudi Aramco to sign China's Yunnan refinery deal in 6 months -Falih - Reuters News

{{20170823T152518.387+0000}}Saudi Aramco to sign China's Yunnan refinery deal in 6 months -FalihJEDDAH, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco is expected to sign a final deal with PetroChina, China's second-largest state-run refiner, within six months to invest in its Yunnan refinery, Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told Reuters on Wednesday.

The world's top oil exporter aims to push ahead with its oil investments in China to become the country's biggest source of crude supply and a major player, Falih said.

"Yunnan (talks) have reached advanced stages ... We aim to finalise Yunnan within six months," Falih, who is also the chairman of Aramco, said.

Aramco will own a "big stake" in the 260,000-barrel per day Anning plant in Yunnan province, he added.

Aramco is looking to invest $1 billion-$1.5 billion in the refinery as well as the retail assets of PetroChina <0857.HK>, sources told Reuters in 2015.

PetroChina aims to start operating the new refinery in the in October after several delays, boosting the nation's already-surging crude imports. [nL4N19F31A]

PetroChina will also will consider taking part in Aramco's initial public offering (IPO) set for next year based on market conditions, the Chinese oil major said in March. [nL3N1H73XU]

A PetroChina official told Reuters in March that if the refinery deal was finalised with Aramco, the Saudi state oil giant would supply at least part of the refinery's crude oil requirements.

Saudi Arabia has lost out to Russia as the top crude supplier to China. [nL4N1L92PM]

Falih said Saudi Arabia aims to break the slow pace in the progress of Saudi projects in China and push for more investments between the two nations.

"The goal is that not only the Kingdom will be China's largest crude exporter but the largest in-market investor," Falih said, one day ahead of a Chinese-Saudi investment forum to be held in Jeddah on Thursday.

In May, Chinese defence conglomerate China North Industries Group Corp (Norinco) signed a framework agreement with Aramco to build a refinery and chemicals complex in northeast China.

That investment would boost Aramco's presence in China's massive refining industry, adding to its 25 percent stake in the Fujian refinery in southeast China operated by state refiner Sinopec Corp <0386.HK>. [nL4N1II3SH]

Shares in CGG surge, traders cite Sinopec bid speculation - Reuters News

{{20170822T114331.023+0000}}Shares in CGG surge, traders cite Sinopec bid speculationPARIS, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Shares in oil services group CGG surged higher on Tuesday, with several traders citing speculation of a bid from China's Sinopec <600028.SS>.

Officials at CGG in Paris and at Sinopec in Beijing could not be immediately reached for comment.

Shares in CGG, which in June filed for bankruptcy as part of a restructuring to reduce its debt burden, were up 22 percent in mid-session trading, although the stock remains down by some 70 percent since the start of 2017. [nL8N1JB6H8]

CGG has debt in excess of $3 billion, and its proposed restructuring could be one of the biggest witnessed in France.

CGG, which specialises in geo-seismic surveys and is listed in Paris and New York, struggled to keep up with payments on its debt as the big oil groups that use its services proved reluctant to lift exploration spending during a period of low oil prices.

The company reported a second quarter net loss of $169.7 million last month. [nW8N1JC004]

Sinopec's June-July retail fuel volumes rise as discounts woo customers - Reuters News

{{20170821T104504.889+0000}}Sinopec's June-July retail fuel volumes rise as discounts woo customersBEIJING, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Sinopec <600028.SS> said on Monday its retail fuel sales volume rose in June and July, reversing a prolonged downturn after the state oil major launched an aggressive campaign to win back customers amid growing competition from private rivals.

Competition among China's gas stations intensified earlier this year as a growing diesel and gasoline glut forced companies to offer big discounts. [nL3N1JC28Z]

The company's first-quarter retail sales had hit a three-year low, before a months-long effort to boost sales by offering steep discounts started paying off.

Sinopec, officially known as China Petroleum & Chemical Corp, did not however disclose the financial impact of the campaign.

In June, retail sales volumes of diesel and gasoline rose 4.3 percent year on year while they were up 6.1 percent last month.

The company reported a 5.5 percent growth in June diesel retail sales, its first monthly increase in more than two years.

Sinopec credited the improvement in sales to its new pre-pay card which offers discounts and also functions as a credit card. By July end, diesel cards sales reached 285,000, it said. China's retail fuel market is worth $440 billion.

The company last month said that the total fuel sales volume, including retail and wholesale, had risen 0.8 percent in the first six months of the year.

On Monday, it said it has introduced measures to improve efficiency and cut costs across its wholesale business. These include centralising purchasing and lowering logistics costs by increasing the use of pipelines and stopping the use of long-distance rail transportation.

Volume through long-distance pipelines was up 12.6 percent year on year in the January-to-July period.

RPT-Cheniere Energy sets up China office to expand sales - sources - Reuters News

{{20170815T120001.897+0000}}RPT-Cheniere Energy sets up China office to expand sales - sources(Repeats item issued earlier, with no change to text)

By Chen Aizhu

BEIJING, Aug 15 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas exporter Cheniere Energy Inc is setting up an office in Beijing to help it clinch long-term supply deals with Chinese buyers, four industry sources said.

Cheniere, which held extensive talks with China earlier this year, will be the first operator of a U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facility to establish a presence in the country. [nL1N1IE14J]

The move follows an agreement in May between the U.S and China to boost trade under the so-called 100-day trade talks that will allow Chinese buyers to purchase long-term supplies from the U.S. directly. [nL1N1IE08B][nL1N1IE08B]

World LNG demand is expected to double to about 71 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) (544 million tonnes a year) by 2040, up from around 32 bcfd in 2015, the U.S. Energy Department estimates, driven by the rapidly growing economies of Asia, particularly China and India.

Cheniere is currently the only company able to export large cargoes of LNG from the continental United States, giving it a leg up to ink long-term contracts with China. Five additional export terminals are expected to open by 2020. [nL1N1G80HH]

Maggie Jia, senior marketing manager with Cheniere Asia who worked previously for Morgan Stanley and Japanese trading house Mitsui, will relocate from Singapore to head up the Beijing office, the sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.

Cheniere also recently hired Chris Li, who worked formerly with China National Offshore Oil Co (CNOOC) [SASACY.UL] and with China's energy policy-setting agency, the National Energy Administration, the sources said.

A Cheniere spokesperson did not immediately comment.

"The idea of the China office came after the 100-day trade talks," said an industry veteran familiar with Cheniere's thinking. "Now the U.S. welcomes China to sign up long-term deals, while the Chinese government is also encouraging companies to diversify supplies."

Cheniere already exports LNG to more than 20 countries from its Sabine Pass LNG export facility in Louisiana which began operating in 2016. [nL1N1JW1EW]

China is the world's third-largest buyer of LNG. It was also the third-biggest importer of U.S. LNG in 2016 but up till now has bought U.S. LNG through short-term, or spot, deals, or from non U.S. companies.

China shipped in 461,720 tonnes of U.S. supplies in the first half of 2017, roughly 3 percent of its total LNG imports, Chinese customs data showed. [O/CHINA7]

China's state energy giants have already signed multiple term supply pacts with more traditional LNG exporters such as Qatar, Indonesia, Malaysia and more recently Australia as the country looks to cut down on the use of dirtier coal.

A trading executive at state-run Sinopec said in May that the company will consider long-term imports from the United States from 2022. [nL4N1IK06Q]

Cheniere already exports LNG to more than 20 countries from its Sabine Pass LNG export facility in Louisiana which began operating in 2016. [nL1N1JW1EW]

China is the world's third-largest buyer of LNG. It was also the third-biggest importer of U.S. LNG in 2016 but up till now has bought U.S. LNG through short-term, or spot, deals, or from non U.S. companies.

China shipped in 461,720 tonnes of U.S. supplies in the first half of 2017, roughly 3 percent of its total LNG imports, Chinese customs data showed. [O/CHINA7]

China's state energy giants have already signed multiple term supply pacts with more traditional LNG exporters such as Qatar, Indonesia, Malaysia and more recently Australia as the country looks to cut down on the use of dirtier coal.

A trading executive at state-run Sinopec said in May that the company will consider long-term imports from the United States from 2022. [nL4N1IK06Q]

BREAKINGVIEWS-Xi throws a bad Party for Hong Kong investors - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20170815T042505.620+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Xi throws a bad Party for Hong Kong investors(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Pete Sweeney

HONG KONG, Aug 15 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The Communist Party is tightening its grip on state-owned enterprises listed in Hong Kong. Beijing has usually set the agenda at SOEs anyway. But injecting yet more of President Xi Jinping's muddled market strategy into decision-making could cost investors.

This year, numerous state-owned giants of finance, energy, telecoms and infrastructure have edited their articles of association to give an explicit role to internal Party committees. These bodies have traditionally sat within an SOE, monitoring the company's ideological soundness, but their influence had waned until recently. The trend is part of a wider push over several years to re-emphasise such organisations, and insert them into private companies.

That Beijing is making Party influence over offshore listed companies more explicit under Xi should come as no surprise. Two years ago, officials swapped the chief executives of China Unicom <0762.HK> and China Telecom <0728.HK> around without explanation. Now that Xi has sidelined his pro-market Premier Li Keqiang, talk about giving markets a "decisive role" has also been muffled.

It is understandable that Xi might see tighter control over SOEs - infamous squanderers of taxpayer money - as a way to force-feed efficiency upgrades. How the change will play out operationally is unclear, however. The adjustment at oil giant Sinopec <0386.HK>, for example, calls for the board of directors to "seek advice" when making decisions on "significant matters." The Party will also give input on management candidates.

This does not oblige the board to follow those recommendations, and in practice much may depend on personalities and factional alliances. In the past the central government has struggled to leash big SOEs with powerful allies. A weak committee inside a strong SOE will not have much influence.

This is nonetheless a backward step in corporate governance. These ideologues hail from the same unaccountable political system that has presided over a massive run-up in corporate debt; that tried and failed to salvage stock markets in 2015; and has a poor record of picking winners. Outsiders will have little visibility into the way cadres interact with management. The committees may revel in their new mandate, but investors are not invited to this Party.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Chinese state-owned enterprises listed in Hong Kong have been adding language into their articles of association specifying that Communist Party committees inside companies should be given a voice in decisions.

- This is part of a wider campaign under President Xi Jinping to increase the presence and importance of party committees inside both state-owned and private companies in China.

- The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, a free-float adjusted index of mainland stocks, has a market capitalisation of roughly HK$6 trillion ($767 billion), Eikon data shows.

UPDATE 1-REUTERS SUMMIT-Repsol Sinopec sees stable output through 2020 - Reuters News

{{20170811T215602.641+0000}}UPDATE 1-REUTERS SUMMIT-Repsol Sinopec sees stable output through 2020(Adds details on Pao de Acucar production, paragraphs 3-8)

RIO DE JANEIRO, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Brazil-based Repsol Sinopec expects oil and gas output to remain steady at an average of 90,000 to 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day through 2020, the firm's chief executive told Reuters as part of the Reuters Latin American Investment Summit.

In an interview on Friday, CEO Leonardo Junqueira said the firm, a joint venture between Spain's Repsol SA and China's Sinopec <600028.SS><0386.HK>, would not bid in a September oil block auction, as it focuses on exploiting its current assets in Brazil.

"We have built this portfolio in recent years to keep this level between 2017 and 2020 as the conclusion of the first investment cycle," Junqueira said, referring to the 90,000 to 100,000 range.

"It doesn't mean that we won't invest to boost production," he added, leaving the door open for future investments.

Junqueira said the company is studying participating in bidding rounds for Brazil's offshore pre-salt fields slated for October.

Repsol Sinopec, Brazil's third largest producer behind state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro and Shell, produced nearly 99,000 boe per day on average in June, government data shows.

One of Repsol Sinopec's key assets is its 35 percent stake in the BM-C-33 block in the pre-salt Campos basin, which includes the promising Pao de Acucar prospect.

"The Pao de Acucar project is going to create robust growth in production and probably exceed 100 thousand barrels (of oil equivalent per day) by a lot," Junqueria said.

Chinese-owned oil firm Addax shuts offices after Swiss bribery case - Reuters News

{{20170807T171028.946+0000}}Chinese-owned oil firm Addax shuts offices after Swiss bribery caseGENEVA, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Chinese-owned oil firm Addax Petroleum is shutting its offices in Geneva, Houston and Aberdeen, it said on Monday, a month after it agreed to pay 31 million Swiss francs ($31.85 million)to settle charges of suspected bribery of foreign officials. [nL8N1JW3Y6]

Confirming a report in the Tribune de Geneve newspaper, Addax said its parent firm Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (SIPC) would integrate the three offices into a new technical centre in Beijing.

SIPC was streamlining its business model in response to low oil prices, the Addax statement said.

"This rationalisation, designed to reduce management duplication, improve efficiency and secure long-term business sustainability, will see Addax Petroleum's Geneva office integrated with SIPC's headquarters in Beijing, and the Geneva office closed by the end of this year."

Addax's operating companies will start reporting directly to SIPC headquarters from August 9, and Addax will run a consultation process for its 174 affected staff in Geneva to mitigate the impact of the organisation change, it said.

The newspaper said Geneva-based staff were informed of the closure on Monday afternoon.

Addax says on its website that it has more than 1,000 employees, and operations in Nigeria, Gabon and Cameroon, as well as joint ventures with Genel in Iraqi Kurdistan and with Repsol in the British North Sea.

Prosecutors for the Swiss canton of Geneva had investigated the company, whose chief executive officer and legal director were also charged, over several tens of millions of dollars in payments to a company and several lawyers in Nigeria.[nL5N1H15A5]

A four-month investigation found the payments were not sufficiently documented and doubts remained on their legality, but no criminal intent was established, the prosecutor's office said.

With that settlement, cases against the CEO and legal director were also closed, a spokesman for the prosecutor said at the time. [nL8N1JW3Y6]

ANALYSIS-Global refiners brace themselves as China cements its oil market dominance - Reuters News

{{20170804T070449.424+0000}}ANALYSIS-Global refiners brace themselves as China cements its oil market dominance* China's 2017 gasoline exports to increase by 10,000 bpd

* Gasoline demand growth slows as bike-sharing takes off

* China to refinery capacity to expand by 350,000 bpd in 2017

By Jessica Jaganathan and Tom Daly

SINGAPORE/BEIJING, Aug 4 (Reuters) - China is on pace to overtake the United States as the world's biggest oil importer this year, cementing its status as Asia's most pivotal oil market actor that will increasingly dominate the region's fuel trade.

For the first time, China imported more crude oil in the first half of the year than the U.S., government statistics showed. China averaged 8.55 million barrels per day (bpd) versus 8.12 million bpd in the U.S., a trend that is expected to last. [nL4N1K41JQ] [nL3N1KG1TT]

The shift highlights the change in the centre of gravity in global oil markets from West to East. Chinese state-run oil trader Unipec is now the world's biggest physical oil trader. By drawing more of the world's oil to its shores, China, the second-biggest oil consumer after the U.S., will play a crucial role in setting the global price of the commodity, especially as the crude futures market in Shanghai develops. [nL3N1H521X][nL3N1JW1HB]

China's import surge is being driven by the expansion of its refinery capacity. But, as the domestic demand has not materialized to soak up the fuel supply, China's exports of gasoline and diesel have climbed to record highs. This flood of products has caused headaches for competitors across Asia and depressed diesel profit margins to multi-year lows in 2016. [nL4N1HV02J] [nL3N1KG1E2] [nB9N1FA00G]

"China is putting a lot of pressure on the traditional export hubs of Taiwan, Korea and Singapore to capture the market share within Southeast Asia and Australia," said Joe Willis, senior research analyst, Asia refining, at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

The trend of more refining capacity and higher exports is set to continue.

China plans to add at least 2.5 million bpd of refining capacity by 2020, according to a recent presentation from China Petroleum & Chemical Corp, or Sinopec. Sinopec is Asia's biggest oil refiner and the parent of Unipec.

This year, PetroChina Ltd will start a 260,000 bpd refinery in Yunnan in southern China while China National Offshore Oil Corp will start up a 200,000 bpd expansion at its existing Huizhou plant in Guangdong province. The start ups will add 350,000 bpd of new Chinese capacity in 2017 though both plants will not reach full capacity until 2018.

Exports of gasoline from China are expected to increase by at least 10,000 barrels per day this year from 2016, driving overseas gasoline sales to between 235,000 bpd and 240,000 bpd this year and about 330,000 bpd in 2018, estimates from consultants FGE and Wood Mackenzie showed.

Unipec is leading the way in targeting new overseas markets, moving jet fuel from Singapore to northwest Europe in June for the first time in several years. Meanwhile, Chinese diesel shipments in 2017 have more than doubled to France, more than quadrupled to Italy and the country shipped diesel to Kenya for the first time this year. [nL3N1J92WI]

HIGH QUALITY FUEL

Export-oriented refiners in Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan will be most affected by the Chinese competition.

"We're trying to diversify and find new markets by increasing the number of our customers in existing countries," a South Korean refining source said, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak with the media.

"It's affecting Korean refiners as we are having one more player in the market."

Japanese and Indian refiners will be less affected.

China and India have eclipsed Japan as Asia's biggest oil consumer. Japanese refiners are consolidating capacity because of a falling population and the increasing use of alternative fuels in the power and transportation sector has cut oil consumption. [nL4N1IE2IV]

Meanwhile, Indian refiners are focusing on meeting soaring domestic demand. [nL3N1KJ3IC]

China's new modern refineries are competing with the region's exporters in producing fuels for countries with stringent fuel standards such as Australia. Diesel exports to Australia climbed seven-fold to 850,000 tonnes in 2016 and are on pace to nearly match that level this year.

A slowdown in Chinese domestic fuel demand as people use more electric vehicles or co-share bicycles and scooters has pushed refiners to export more gasoline.

China's gasoline demand is expected to slow to 3.5 to 4 percent in 2017 compared with last year's 6.5 percent growth, said Sri Paravaikkarasu, head of East of Suez oil at FGE.

Sales growth for automobiles, mainly powered by gasoline, has slowed to 0.7 percent in the first half of 2017, compared with 8.7 percent a year ago, while those powered by alternative fuels grew 52.9 percent, BMI Research said.

UPDATE 2-Indian Oil, partners look for cheaper site for Pacific NorthWest LNG terminal - Reuters News

{{20170803T135005.067+0000}}UPDATE 2-Indian Oil, partners look for cheaper site for Pacific NorthWest LNG terminal* Indian Oil interested in Canadian gas production

* Would pursue downstream aspects of project less aggressively

* To float tender to import 2 mln barrels U.S. crude in August

* Avg GRM falls to $4.32/bbl from $9.98/bbl last yr

(Adds details from press conference)

By Nidhi Verma and Neha Dasgupta

Aug 3 (Reuters) - Indian Oil Corp Ltd said it is in talks with its partners to scout for an alternative, cheaper site for the Pacific Northwest LNG terminal after the recent pullout of the lead developer cast doubt on the future of the Canadian project.

Malaysia's state-owned Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) [PETR.UL], which held a majority 62 percent stake in the proposed C$36 billion ($29 billion) Pacific NorthWest LNG Project in British Columbia, said last week it was abandoning the plan due to weak global prices. [nL1N1KG1CB]

Sanjiv Singh, chairman of Indian Oil, which has a 10 percent stake in the Canadian project, said the company remained interest in going ahead with at least part of the plan.

"We are very much positive going ahead with the upstream part of it, which is gas production. Liquefaction and transportation further in the liquid form we are not pursuing, I mean, we don't want to pursue very aggressively as of now," he told a news conference.

"We are also looking at a different location which might be much less expensive than the earlier one," Singh said.

Indian Oil's head of business development, G.K. Satish, said consortium partners are talking about alternatives. He declined to comment on write-offs IOC might be taking in the next quarter for investment in the Canadian LNG project.

Petronas's pullout dealt a blow to the project and its partners which would now have to invest additional capital to complete the project.

Indian Oil is the first partner to suggest the project could still go ahead, in modified form.

"Cost of liquefaction, transportation and retail outside Canada has gone up. And today we are finding that it may not be very attractive at the present prices," Singh said.

The other partners in the project are Chinese oil and gas giant Sinopec <600028.SS>, with 15 percent, Japex Montney Ltd, with 10 percent, and Petroleum Brunei, with 3 percent.

Petronas may have to write off up to $800 million for work already done on the Canadian project, analysts say. [nL3N1KI3AR]

Japan Petroleum Exploration Co (Japex) <1662.T> said on Wednesday it would take a loss of about C$102 million ($82 million) due to the scrapping of the project. [nL3N1KH1DJ]

Indian Oil Corp planned to lift 1.2 million tonnes of the super-cooled fuel for 20 years from the British Columbia project for its 5 million tonne a year regasification LNG plant at Ennore in eastern India. Indian Oil was expecting deliveries from the western Canadian project to begin in 2020.

The company said it also expected a "slight delay" from Cameron LNG project in the United States and will see deliveries by the end of 2018.

Indian Oil will float a tender to import 2 million barrels of high sulphur U.S. crude in August. It intends to import high sulphur oil from the United States for as long as benchmark WTI prices are depressed, Finance Director A.K. Sharma said.

The company's net profit fell 45 percent in its fiscal first quarter of 2017, beating analysts' estimates, although higher inventory losses and lower refining margins weighed on profitability.

Net profit was 45.49 billion rupees ($714.83 million) in the quarter ended on June 30, compared with 82.69 billion rupees a year earlier, the country's top refiner said. (http://bit.ly/2v21dfw)

Analysts on average had expected a net profit of 30.63 billion rupees for the first quarter, Thomson Reuters data showed.

India's top refiner suffered an inventory loss - due to sudden changes in oil and refined product prices - of 40.4 billion rupees in the June quarter compared to a gain of 74.8 billion rupees a year ago, Sharma said.

The company's quarterly average gross refining margins, or profit earned on each barrel of crude processed, fell to $4.32 per barrel, compared with $9.98 per barrel in the same period last year.

IOC's shares closed 4.6 percent up and was the top percentage gainer on the broader Nifty 50 <.NSEI> index.
