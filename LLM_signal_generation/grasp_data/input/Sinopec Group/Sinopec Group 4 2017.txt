{{20170519T105945.382+0000}}FACTBOX-China's LNG import terminals and plans(Adds ENN's Zhoushan and Guangzhou Gas's Nansha terminals)

BEIJING, May 19 (Reuters) - ENN Group, China's first private
company to get state approval to build and operate a liquefied
natural gas import terminal, now expects to be ready to take its
first gas by the middle of next year, an executive said.

ENN, one of the country's largest independent gas
distributors, is building the 3 million tonne-per-year import
terminal at Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province.

It has secured about 1.47 million tonnes LNG supply under
term deals with suppliers including Total , Origin
Energy  and Chevron .

Guangzhou Gas Group, a local govenrment-backed gas
distributor and dominant supplier to Guangzhou, plans to build a
2 million-tpy receiving terminal at Guanzhou's Nansha port by
2020. [nL4N1IK1S9]

State-run Sinopec Corp <0386.HK> will start operating its
third terminal this year, Chen Bo, president of the company's
trading vehicle Unipec, told an industry seminar this week.

Since the first LNG terminal in Guangdong province opened in
2006 China has become the world's third largest buyer of LNG
after Japan and South Korea, operating a total of about 44
million tonnes of annual import capacity.

Following is a list of China's LNG terminals and project
plans according to company reports, industry officials and state
media. For China's LNG trade, please see O/CHINA7.

BEIJING, May 17 (Reuters) - China's Unipec, trading arm of state oil major Sinopec <600028.SS>, resold more than 2 million tonnes of term cargoes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) last year and expects to sell more this year, president Chen Bo said on Wednesday.

Chinese oil majors, including Sinopec, have been forced to resell term LNG or renegotiate deals due to strong competition from cheaper and abundant spot supplies.

Chen was speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of a gas industry conference in Beijing.

Unipec, Vitol set to supply Bangladesh with fuel in H2 2017 - 路透新闻

{{20170517T110846.095+0000}}Unipec, Vitol set to supply Bangladesh with fuel in H2 2017By Ruma Paul and Seng Li Peng

DHAKA/SINGAPORE, May 17 (Reuters) - Bangladesh Petroleum Corp has received offers from 11 companies for fuel supplies in the second half of the year, with Unipec and Vitol looking set to win the tender with the lowest offers on middle distillates and fuel oil, a BPC official said.

Bangladesh Petroleum Corp was looking to buy up to 1.06 million tonnes of gasoil, jet fuel and fuel oil for second-half 2017 delivery in a tender that closed on May 16. [nL4N1I72SR]

"As per weighted average, Unipec's offers are the lowest for both gasoil and jet fuel," said the official from Bangladesh Petroleum Corp (BPC).

"Unipec is supposed to win the tender for both gasoil and jet fuel, while Vitol will win the tender for fuel oil. We will finalize the deals by the end of this month after verifying all other details," the official said.

Unipec - trading arm of Chinese state oil major Sinopec <600028.SS> - has offered to sell gasoil to Bangladesh at $2.27 to $2.47 a barrel premium to Middle East quotes versus other offers at $2.47 to $4.65, according to a document provided by a participant in the tender and seen by Reuters.

Unipec offered jet fuel for the second half period to Bangladesh at a premium of $2.87 a barrel, the document said.

The offers are higher compared with an existing first-half 2017 contract Bangladesh has with Unipec in which gasoil was sealed below $2.20 a barrel and jet fuel at $2.76 a barrel.

As for fuel oil, Vitol had the lowest offer for the second-half 2017 contract at $29.73 a barrel for June-December delivery versus other offers ranging from $41.22 to $67.80.

Vitol's current contract with Bangladesh to supply fuel oil for January-June was inked at a premium of $15.80 a barrel.

Others who took part in the Bangladesh tender, according to the document, include Trafigura [TRAFG.UL], Glencore , Emirates National Oil Co, Sinochem [SASADA.UL], PTT PCL , Gulf Petroleum and Swiss Singapore.

UPDATE 2-China's crude oil imports ease from record, fuel exports fall - 路透新闻

{{20170508T053029.957+0000}}UPDATE 2-China's crude oil imports ease from record, fuel exports fall* April crude imports down nearly 9 pct vs March record

* Jan-April crude imports up 12.5 pct y/y

* April fuel exports down 25 pct vs March

* Imports seen easing further on overhauls, quotas - analyst

(adds analyst comment, background on quotas)

BEIJING, May 8 (Reuters) - China's crude oil imports eased in April from March's record high as refiners processed less oil during a heavy maintenance season, while exports of refined fuel fell by a quarter from a month earlier due to quota reductions.

China shipped in 34.39 million tonnes of crude oil last month, or about 8.37 million barrels per day (bpd), down nearly 9 percent from March, according to data from China's General Administration of Customs on Monday.

April's level was still up 5.5 percent from a year ago, while imports for the first four months of the year rose 12.5 percent to 139.12 million tonnes, or 8.46 million bpd.

"April looks more like a return to normal import level. Imports will likely trend down further in the coming few months as refinery maintenance season unfolds and teapots run out of import quotas," said Harry Liu, analyst of consultancy IHS Markit.

Arrivals in March hit 9.17 million bpd as China's intake topped the United States for the first time in 2017.[nL3N1HK1DG]

April's slower imports came as major refineries kicked off their annual maintenance periods, although lower crude oil prices still supported robust demand from some processors. [REF/OUT]

Oil prices have tumbled to five-month lows, with benchmark Brent crude down nearly 15 percent from a mid-April high [O/R], hit by the breakneck pace of U.S. oil output that have undermined OPEC efforts to rein in production.

Many of China's independent refineries, nicknamed "teapots", have nearly run out of import permits issued at the start of the year, another reason for slowing imports, said IHS's Liu.

He expected purchases to pick up from July after Beijing grants the second batch of quotas, although China has started to limit how much crude oil can be imported by private refiners. [nL4N1HZ3VD].

The state planner said last month it will stop accepting from May 5 new applications from private oil refiners seeking approval to use imported crude oil. [nL4N1HZ3VD]

April imports of oil products fell 7.8 percent to 2.49 million tonnes while exports of oil products [C-FUEXP] fell 25.1 percent to 3.50 million tonnes.

The fall in exports was partly because of a sharp reduction in quotas, after the second batch of permits issued to the country's dominant state oil firms for 2017 was down 73 percent from the first round. [nL3N1HE18O]

The government also barred independents from fuel exports from the beginning of this year. [nL3N1GN2JR]

BREAKINGVIEWS-China's Aramco pitch puts pressure on Tokyo's bid - 路透新闻

{{20170420T070918.826+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-China's Aramco pitch puts pressure on Tokyo's bid(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Pete Sweeney

HONG KONG, April 20 (Reuters Breakingviews) - China has upped the ante in the race for influence over Saudi Aramco's flotation. It has assembled a state consortium to act as cornerstone investors as it pushes for a Hong Kong listing. Rival exchanges in Tokyo and Singapore will need to step up to stay in the game.

According to a source-based Reuters report on Wednesday, China Investment Corporation (CIC), the $800 billion sovereign wealth fund, oil majors including Sinopec <600028.SS> and PetroChina <601857.SS>, <0857.HK>, and state banks would join the group. The move, which would mean committing ahead of time to buying a large, fixed amount of stock during the listing, is meant in part to sway Aramco towards a Hong Kong listing.

Graphic: Bigger market: http://reut.rs/2otYiqU

The initial public offering, forecast to break world records at $100 billion, is certain to attract some Chinese sovereign funds whether Aramco lists in Hong Kong or on Mars. But launching at least part of the float in the special administrative region, which has struggled to find successful IPOs of late, would please Beijing. The mainland team will be more interested in the prestige gained from playing a role in the world's biggest listing than its price tag.

Riyadh is sensibly engaging with everyone. King Salman visited both China and Japan in March to talk up Aramco. Japan is still a contender; a Breakingviews analysis of market characteristics puts Tokyo in second place behind New York as a foreign venue for the oil giant. Japan also imported more Saudi crude than China last year.

Even so, the Middle Kingdom has extra strategic attractions. For one thing, China's total crude imports are far larger than Japan's, and demand is growing far more rapidly. There are also benefits in partnering with a rising naval power with major strategic interests in the Middle East.

Finally, letting China win doesn't cost much. Beijing hopes a big stake in Aramco will increase China's access to Saudi supply, but the total stake being floated is around 5 percent. Foreign leverage over Aramco will be kept minimal by design. The desert kingdom has a history of manipulating more powerful partners to serve its own interests; China will be no exception.

CONTEXT NEWS

- China is creating a consortium of state-owned oil giants, banks and its sovereign wealth fund, that will act as a cornerstone investor in the planned initial public offering of national energy giant Saudi Arabian Oil Co, popularly known as Aramco, Reuters reported on April 19, citing sources.

- Aramco plans to list next year with a potential $100 billion equity sale, expected to be the world's largest to date.

- Half a dozen sources with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters that China Investment Corporation (CIC), the country's $800 billion sovereign wealth fund, oil majors Sinopec and PetroChina, and the country's state-run banks were among the state-backed entities set to participate in the Chinese investment consortium.

- Reuters reported in February that Industrial and Commercial Bank of China International Holdings, a unit of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and China International Capital Corporation (CICC) were among the Chinese banks pitching for a role in the IPO.

- Aramco's board will meet in China in May for the first time in seven years, industry sources told Reuters, as the state-owned energy firm seeks to lure Chinese and Asian investors.

- The governments of Japan and Saudi Arabia said in a joint statement in March that Aramco and the Tokyo Stock Exchange were considering setting up a joint group to study a Japan listing for the Saudi oil giant.

* Consortium to include banks, oil majors, sovereign wealth fund

* China pushing for Hong Kong listing in return for investment

* Aramco seriously considering a listing in Asia

By Julie Zhu, Reem Shamseddine and Rania El Gamal

HONG KONG/RIYADH/DUBAI, April 20 (Reuters) - China is creating a consortium, including state-owned oil giants and banks and its sovereign wealth fund, that will act as a cornerstone investor in the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, people with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters.

Saudi Aramco, a key exporter to China along with Russia's Rosneft , is due to list next year, with a potential $100 billion equity sale that is expected to be the world's largest to date.

The planned Chinese investment makes it more likely that the national energy giant would seek a listing in Asia, with Hong Kong currently the frontrunner among bourses in the region, the same people said.

Reuters reported earlier this month that Saudi Aramco's board would meet in Shanghai in May, its first meeting in China in seven years, as Chinese and Asian investors eye the share offering from the world's biggest oil exporter. [nL8N1HH085]

Saudi officials have said Chinese companies were interested in investing in the Aramco IPO as the country - the second biggest consumer of oil globally - seeks to secure crude supplies, but have not commented on how that would be done.

Half a dozen sources with knowledge of the discussions said China Investment Corporation (CIC), the country's $800 billion sovereign wealth fund, oil majors Sinopec <600028.SS> and PetroChina <601857.SS> <0857.HK>, and the country's state-run banks were among the state-backed entities set to participate in the Chinese investment consortium.

They did not name the banks. Reuters reported in February that Industrial and Commercial Bank of China International Holdings, a unit of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China <601398.SS>, and China International Capital Corporation (CICC) were among the Chinese banks pitching for a role in the IPO. [nL1N1G61Z6]

One person involved in discussions between Aramco and potential Chinese investors said the ultimate size of the consortium's stake had not yet been decided.

That source said the entity that would lead the consortium had also not been decided, with many state-run groups keen to take on the high-profile role. That is likely to be decided by China's cabinet, the State Council, over the coming months.

"The IPO will help decide whom, or which country, can secure the crude supplies from the company and Saudi Arabia going forward," the person said, adding the size of each company's stake in the Chinese consortium would depend on its current relationship with Aramco and the Saudi government.

"For instance, if you were already a strategic investor or plan to become one in the long-term, things would become easier."

The State Council Information Office, CIC, Sinopec and PetroChina did not respond to requests for comment.

Last month, PetroChina's president and vice chairman, Wang Dongjin, said the company would consider participating in the IPO depending on market conditions, while Sinopec has said the oil giant would discuss the IPO with Aramco. [nL3N1H73V0]

Saudi Aramco said in an email it did not comment on "rumour or speculation".

ASIA LISTING

Saudi authorities plan to list up to 5 percent of Aramco on the Saudi stock exchange in Riyadh, the Tadawul, and also one or more international markets.

The $100 billion IPO price tag is based on Aramco being valued at $2 trillion, although some analysts believe the ultimate valuation could be much lower.

One of the sources who spoke to Reuters said the Chinese government was pushing hard for Aramco to list in Hong Kong in return for the consortium's investment, while three other sources said Aramco was leaning towards having an Asian - likely Hong Kong - listing along with possibly a London listing.

A final decision has not been made, the sources said.

Other mooted Asian options include Tokyo and Singapore.

"The Saudis are serious about Asia. They can maintain market share there. At the end of the day, Aramco needs to sell its oil. This is just another way of guaranteeing a long-term market," one industry source said.

This month, British Prime Minister Theresa May and London Stock Exchange Group CEO Xavier Rolet visited Saudi in a bid to win the London listing. A spokesman for the LSE Group declined to comment.

In February, HKEX chief Charles Li said the bourse was working "very hard" to snag the deal. [nL3N1GC1YI]

On Tuesday, a HKEX spokesperson said the exchange was an attractive venue for international companies because it can serve as a gateway to Greater China's "vast liquidity pool".

UPDATE 2-China's Sinopec says fire at rubber warehouse has been put out  - 路透新闻

{{20170413T080830.944+0000}}UPDATE 2-China's Sinopec says fire at rubber warehouse has been put out * Sinopec says fire extinguished, no casualties

* Says will not affect petrochemical production

(Updates to show fire has been put out)

BEIJING, April 13 (Reuters) - Sinopec Corp <0386.HK> said on Thursday that a fire in a warehouse at a petrochemical and refining complex in southern China operated by one of its subsidiaries was put out at 2:20 pm local time and had not affected production.

Sinopec said in a statement the fire started at 9:55 (0255 GMT) on Thursday in a warehouse for synthetic rubber in the facility operated by Sinopec Maoming Petrochemical Corp in the province of Guangdong. It said there were no casualties.

The Maoming plant is one of the country's largest oil refineries, producing 360,000 barrels per day, and is also able to churn out 1.1 million tonnes of ethylene annually.

Part of the refinery was shut from March 20 for planned maintenance, a company source told Reuters previously. [nB9N1DC017]

Sinopec said it would investigate the cause of the fire and avoid similar accidents in future.

* Beats U.S. as top crude oil importer for March, year so far

* Indicates strong stockbuild of nearly 1.7 mln bpd - IHS

* Pace to slow on maintenance, lack of storage space -IHS

(Adds quote on teapots' rush to use quotas, background on maintenance, fuel quotas, comparison with U.S. crude imports)

By Chen Aizhu and Meng Meng

BEIJING, April 13 (Reuters) - China's crude oil imports surged to an all-time high in March to nearly 9.2 million barrels per day (bpd), customs data showed on Thursday, far surpassing expectations and overtaking the United States as independent refiners ramped up their purchases.

The March imports came in at 38.95 million tonnes, or 9.17 million bpd, according to the General Customs Administration. That compared with 8.286 million bpd in February and far exceeded an earlier record of 8.57 million bpd in December.

Both the March and the first-quarter import levels were above those of the United States according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) , making China the world's top crude oil buyer so far this year.

The shipments were in part driven by independent oil refiners' rush to purchase oil after they received fresh 2017 quotas around mid-January. [nB9N1H4048] [nL4N1DZ0AT]

"This rush of buying were mostly for March arriving cargoes. In our case, the amount of crude oil we bought for March exceeded the total for the first two months," said a trading manager with Shandong Dongming Petrochemical Group, the country's largest independent oil processor.

Last year, most of China's more than 900,000 bpd increase in its crude oil imports was due to independent refiners that had newly received permits for bringing in shipments. [nL4N1F31II]

China last week also granted crude import quotas to newly qualified independent refiners to purchase from the international market for the first time. [nB9N1H4048]

"The 9.2 million bpd of crude imports is definitely a shocking number. That means China built close to 1.7 million bpd of crude inventory in March, way off the chart from any perspective," said Harry Liu, an analyst with consultancy IHS Markit.

Still, IHS expected a sharp drop to around 8 million bpd in coming months as seasonal refinery maintenance picks up, and as available storage tank space dwindled, said Liu. [REF/A]

PACE TO SLOW

Many of China's key state refineries are entering maintenance in the second quarter, such as Sinopec's <0386.HK> Shanghai and Yangzi refineries and PetroChina's <0857.HK> Dalian refinery. [nL3N1GX1NC]

China's crude oil imports for the first quarter grew 15 percent over the same period a year ago to 104.73 million tonnes, or about 8.49 million bpd. [TRADE/CN]

U.S. crude imports were at 7.97 million bpd in March and 8.17 million bpd in the first quarter, according to Reuters calculations based on EIA data.

There was likely an element of catch-up in the Chinese data, with North Sea crudes bought in December and January finally making their way into the numbers and U.S. crudes exported in February showing up as late-March arrivals, said Virendra Chauhan, Singapore-based analyst at Energy Aspects.

The customs data also showed that China's March refined fuel imports were up 10.2 percent on year at 2.7 million tonnes, while exports for the month rose nearly a quarter on year at 4.67 million tonnes.

China slashed a second batch of fuel export quotas for 2017 by 73 percent versus the first around for the year, under so called processing trade terms, potentially leading to slowing exports in coming months. [nL3N1HE18O]

Any drop, however, could be partly offset by rising shipments overseas under a separate, general trade category in which the government allotted 1.31 million tonnes of exports quotas, mostly for gasoline and diesel. [nL3N1HI3R0]

Diversify or die: China's independent oil refiners adapt to new challenges - 路透新闻

{{20170411T055838.638+0000}}Diversify or die: China's independent oil refiners adapt to new challenges* Independent refiners under pressure from new govt rules, taxes

* Refiners, or teapots, look to clean energy, lumber, trading

* Teapots struggle as China's oil demand growth slows

By Chen Aizhu

BEIJING, April 11 (Reuters) - Cut off from lucrative fuel export markets and seeing their margins squeezed by new taxes, China's independent oil refiners are branching out into new sectors from clean energy and lumber as well as expanding their trading to overcome the challenges.

These independents, known as "teapots" since they are smaller companies than their state-owned rivals, are scrambling to survive shifting government policies at the same time domestic oil demand growth is slowing, undermining their ability to expand by just serving their home market. In 2016, China's annual fuel demand growth was at a three-year low.

"The good days won't last much longer, as China's oil demand has been shrinking," said Zhang Liucheng, vice president of Shandong Dongming Petrochemical Group, the country's largest independent refiner.

Late last year, Beijing suspended fuel export quotas for the independents, handing control of diesel and gasoline exports to the dominant state refiners. [nL4N1EB30D]

Other government moves may also squeeze the independent's margins. Top state refiner Sinopec overhauled its fuel buying policy by centralizing all purchases at its Beijing headquarters and China plans to slap consumption taxes on refinery by-products such as light cycle oil, sold as diesel, and mixed aromatics, which are added to gasoline to improve fuel quality. [nL3N1H524R][nL3N1HD2JU]

"They had already been diversified and nimble at working around the various government mandates...now they are definitely looking for ways to step up their game and have better people, global access and financing to do so," said Michal Meidan, analyst at consultants Energy Aspects.

Executives at some of China's top independent refiners outlined to Reuters their plans to diversify to endure these changes.

Dongming, for example, plans to add a 800,000 tonnes-per-year naphtha cracker, extending its business from transportation fuels to higher value plastics and synthetic rubber as well as fine chemicals, said Zhang.

The 260,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) refiner is also looking to invest in small-scale onshore fields, said Zhang.

Zhang also aims to boost trading operations by combining physical oil and gas trading with financial services such as offering credit facilities for fellow teapots at better rates than banks.

Underscoring how much Beijing has prioritised clean energy, Shandong Haike Group said it will open this month a factory that makes electrolytes used in lithium batteries for electric vehicles.

The company said the plant will be the country's largest with the capacity to produce 100,000 tonnes a year. It also plans to grow its pharmaceutical business but has no plans to expand its refining capacity.

UNCERTAIN FUTURE FOR TEAPOTS

Shandong Chambroad Group plans to move into lumber processing to develop a special building material for villa cottages and gardens, said chairman Ma Yunsheng. [nL4N1971XY]

In addition to the policy actions against them, the teapots have lost a major advocate with the departure of Shandong provincial governor Guo Shuqing, which further shrouds their future, said Energy Aspects' Meidan. [nL3N1GB0EW]

Newly installed Shandong party chief Liu Jiayi could try to tackle overcapacity and pollution in the province, which would add to pressure on the independents, she said.

For some, the expansions are an opportunity to move from a small local operation into a global company.

Shandong Hengyuan Petrochemical Co, a refiner backed by a local government and the first teapot to own a refinery abroad, wants to become a regional player, combining assets at its home base in Shandong with the refinery in Port Dickson, Malaysia, that it recently acquired from Shell .

As part of the expansion, it will set up a trading desk in Kuala Lumpur to secure crude for the two plants with a combined capacity of 160,000 bpd and also supply 4 millions of tonnes of fuel annually to Shell under a 10-year pact.

"Without differentiating yourself, the competition will be tough," said Hengyuan's chairman Wang Youde.

UPDATE 1-Sinopec exports first diesel cargo under general trade terms in 13 yrs - 路透新闻

{{20170407T112303.629+0000}}UPDATE 1-Sinopec exports first diesel cargo under general trade terms in 13 yrs* China slashed quotas under processing scheme

* General trade offers refiners flexibility

* General trade off-limits to independent refiners

(Adds trader's comment, background on trade categories)

BEIJING, April 7 (Reuters) - Top Asian refiner Sinopec Crop <600028.SS> exported its first refined fuel cargo under so-called general trade terms in 13 years, the company said on Friday, as China's state-owned refiners adapt to tighter government export quotas.

Sinopec exported a diesel cargo on April 1 from its Qingdao plant in east China for delivery to Singapore under the rules, it said.

Chinese refiners mainly export refined oil products under processing trade terms and the government has set an annual quota on how much each refiner can ship. [nL1N1EN07S]

The government slashed the second round of export quotas under processing trade rules for 2017 by 73 percent versus the first batch. [nL3N1HE18O]

Under the processing scheme, refiners are exempted from taxes on both the crude oil imported and the oil products exported, while under the general trade category plants get tax refunds after exports are completed, said four traders familiar with the rules.

Both require quotas, but general trade offers much greater flexibility as refiners have the full authority to decide when and how much refined fuel to export.

"For large refiners like Sinopec and PetroChina, the flexibility to market refined barrels in domestic or overseas market as they see fit means good profitability," said a former state oil trading executive.

It was not immediately clear how many quotas Beijing is considering or may have issued to state refiners under the general trade rules. The shipments like Sinopec's cargo could be a supplement to the prevailing exports under processing trade, said two Beijing-based oil traders.

Under the processing, or so-called "tolling" schemes, refiners have a fixed volume and time slots to export, both under tight scrutiny of Chinese customs, the Beijing-based oil traders said.

Beijing has suspended the grant of export quotas under processing trade rules to independent refiners for this year, ending a year-old policy allowing some independents to sell diesel, gasoline and naphtha abroad and dealing a blow to the group. [nL4N1EB30D]

General trade exports are totally off-limits to these independents, executives at these smaller firms have said.

Exxon Mobil markets mid-term Papua New Guinea LNG supplies - 路透新闻

{{20170407T062917.389+0000}}Exxon Mobil markets mid-term Papua New Guinea LNG suppliesCHIBA, Japan, April 7 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is marketing 1.3 million tonnes per year (mtpa) of mid-term liquefied natural gas volumes from its $19 billion Papua New Guinea LNG (PNG LNG) plant, reflecting overproduction and an increase in gas reserves.

The two-train plant with an original nameplate capacity of 6.9 million tonnes a year produced 7.9 million tonnes last year, making it possible to offer the excess for sale, Stephen McCusker, Vice President of PNG Marketing at ExxonMobil Asia Pacific Pte Ltd told Reuters at a gas conference in Japan.

The move is also possible as ExxonMobil PNG, operator of the PNG LNG joint venture, said in February that a study showed that the likely technically recoverable natural gas from all PNG LNG fields is 11.5 trillion cubic feet (tcf), up a quarter from an earlier assessment of 9.2 tcf.

"Originally we contracted for the base project 6.6 mtpa, and last year we produced close to 7.9 mtpa, so the 1.3 mtpa plus the additional recertification gives us an opportunity to approach the market with the mid-term contracts," McCusker told Reuters on Thursday at the Gastech conference in Chiba.

PNG LNG's main four long-term customers are top global LNG buyer JERA Co at 1.8 million tonnes a year, Osaka Gas <9532.T> at 1.5 million, Taiwan's CPC with 1.2 million, and China's Sinopec <600028.SS> at 2 million tonnes a year.

The PNG project sells the remainder as spot and short-term supplies to those four and other customers, Exxon Mobil said.

The U.S. oil and gas major and its joint venture partners are also looking at some upcoming opportunities, McCusker said.

"Other fields that we've already discovered within the project, and of course, the other projects that are occurring around us - obviously the Total project - so PNG LNG is looking at those opportunities," he said.

Exxon Mobil and Total SA , vying to develop new gas fields in Papua New Guinea to tap into an expected market recovery in the next decade, are likely to face tougher terms than Exxon Mobil's PNG LNG project. [nL4N1E00Z2] [nL2N1GE0XV]

Prime Minister O'Neill has said the government had been generous when negotiating Exxon Mobil's PNG LNG project in 2009, as it was looking to secure the country's biggest foreign investment despite the global financial crisis.

Sinopec exports first diesel cargo under general trade terms in 13 yrs  - 路透新闻

UPDATE 2-Traders cancel light cycle oil cargoes ahead of China tax-sources - 路透新闻

{{20170406T094933.348+0000}}UPDATE 2-Traders cancel light cycle oil cargoes ahead of China tax-sources* China buyers cancel two late-April loading cargoes - sources

* A third cargo may also be cancelled soon - source

* Interest for May loading cargoes dwindles - refining source

(Adds analyst, Sinopec comment, teapot reaction)

By Jessica Jaganathan

SINGAPORE/BEIJING, April 6 (Reuters) - Traders in North Asia are rushing to cancel loadings of a range of oil products for sale to China, ahead of a planned Chinese consumption tax that will make the trade uneconomic.

At least two light cycle oil (LCO) cargoes have been cancelled for late April loading from South Korea ahead of the planned tax on the refinery by-product, two sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday. They declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak with the media.

The cargoes were purchased by Chinese companies who have in turn cancelled their requirement, one of the sources said, adding that another Chinese oil trader is trying to cancel a third cargo.

Interest for May-loading LCO cargoes has also disappeared, a Japanese refining source said.

A senior source with a Shandong-based independent refiner said his company has held off booking new cargoes beyond a 40,000-tonne parcel of mixed aromatics for late April arrival.

China plans to impose consumption taxes on oil by-products such as mixed aromatics, light cycle oil and bitumen blend, sources with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday. The plan will likely squeeze the margins of the independent refiners. The combined imports of these products are estimated at 20 million tonnes a year. [nL3N1HD2JU]

The move will close a loophole that allowed Chinese buyers to import light cycle oil, then sell it locally as low-grade diesel, avoiding import taxes that would normally be levied on diesel.

"Demand for these products have in recent years been distorted because of exemptions from consumption tax," said Seng-Yick Tee, an analyst with consultancy SIA Energy.

A consumption tax of 1,400 yuan ($203) per tonne could be levied for LCO, the sources said on Wednesday, with traders expecting the tax in May or June.

The Chinese government has considered the taxes since 2012 but was more determined this time as imports of these products rose and ate into the market share of state-owned companies like Sinopec Corp <0386.HK>, said senior Beijing-based traders and oil company officials.

The tax advantages of LCO have led refiners to maximise production over other fuels, the two sources with knowledge of the South Korean cargoes said.

LCO was selling at a premium to Korea gasoil prices of about $6 a barrel on a free-on-board (FOB) Korea basis at its peak earlier this year, which in turn attracted cargoes from as far away as Europe, traders said.

The premium for LCO has since dropped to about $2 to $3 a barrel, but volumes of the fuel into China have soared.

Imports of LCO into China rose to as much as 600,000 tonnes a month by March from 350,000 tonnes a month last year, two traders familiar with the market said.

* Volumes slashed by 73 percent from first round - sources

* PetroChina not given quota in this trade category - sources

By Seng Li Peng and Jessica Jaganathan

SINGAPORE, April 5 (Reuters) - China has cut oil product export quotas to the nation's four
oil majors by 73 percent in the second batch of export quotas for 2017, two sources familiar
with the matter said on Wednesday.

The quota did not include PetroChina <601857.SS>, the sources said, which is unusual as
PetroChina is a major exporter of oil products. The reason was not immediately clear.

But this does not mean PetroChina will not be exporting oil products, a source said, adding
that PetroChina would continue to export under a different trade category.

Sinopec Corp <600028.SS>, CNOOC <0883.HK> and Sinochem Group <600500.SS> will be allowed to
sell an additional 3.335 million tonnes of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel this year, the sources
said.

The three oil majors together with PetroChina were given a quota of 12.4 million tonnes of
oil products to export in 2017 in the first round of quotas. [nL1N1EN07S]

China issued allowances for a record 46.08 million tonnes of oil products in 2016, up 80
percent from 2015. The world's second-largest oil consumer exported about 48.3 million tonnes of
refined oil products in 2016, up 34 percent from the previous year, customs data shows.
 [nEAP222684]

Traders had expected the second quota round to be higher than the first as regional fuel
demand for construction and transport usually picks up after the winter slowdown.

China usually releases three or four rounds of quotas a year.

ANALYSIS-Brazil's oil exports set to jump this year, weakening OPEC curbs - 路透新闻

{{20170331T174233.041+0000}}ANALYSIS-Brazil's oil exports set to jump this year, weakening OPEC curbsBy Marta Nogueira and Marcelo Teixeira

RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO, March 31 (Reuters) - Brazil is poised to sharply increase oil exports this year as heavy investments spur new output and demand for its lighter crudes win more buyers, especially in China and India.

Production is projected to rise 210,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2017, second only in the size of additional supply to the United States among non-OPEC producers. Higher output from the U.S. and Brazil are among the factors impeding an OPEC-led effort to lift crude prices through production cuts. [nL3N1H84F2]

Growth in exports should continue in future years as companies such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc prepare to tap some of the largest discoveries made since the end of the last decade off the nation's Atlantic coast.

Already just in the first two months of the year, Brazil's oil exports have soared 65 percent over the same period a year earlier to record highs of more than 1.46 million bpd, according to government data obtained by Reuters. [nL2N1GF1V8]

Consultancy Wood Mackenzie estimates 2017 exports will hit nearly 1 million bpd, up from 798,000 bpd last year.

Years of heavy investment that left state-controlled Petróleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) as the world's most indebted oil company are beginning to pay off. The nation hopes to use higher oil sales to help drag its economy out of a two-year recession.

Exports are rising along with the company's output of light, sweet crudes, Guilherme Franca, executive manager for marketing and trading at Petrobras told Reuters.

"Our production consists of much lighter oil than we used to produce in the past," he said in an interview.

"We have demand for more of it than we can deliver."

Light, low-sulfur crudes are easier and cheaper to refine into gasoline and diesel, and match demands for less polluting fuels in Asia, the United States and Europe.

Franca said exports by Petrobras alone rose to 420,000 bpd in 2016 and should reach 450,000 bpd this year. If it meets future targets, the company could be exporting as much as 750,000 bpd as soon as 2020, he said.

In the first two months this year, Brazil sold 10.4 million barrels of crude to India, half as much as it shipped to the country during 2016, Brazil's trade ministry data showed.

Sales to China in January and February totaled 40.8 million barrels, up 125 percent from the same period in 2016 and more than 10 times Brazil's shipments to the country five years ago.

Some of the oil shipments are linked to repayments on as much as $15 billion in loans from China, including debt taken on in 2009.

Under deals with lender China Development Bank, the oil giant would send as much as 300,000 bpd to four Chinese firms: China National United Oil Corporation, China Zhenhua Oil Co Ltd, Chemchina Petrochemical Co Ltd and Unipec Asia, a subsidiary of Sinopec Corp .[nL1N1EB0B8][nL2N1652DA]

"There is strong demand currently for Brazil's medium-sweet crude. The United States, China, Korea, India, they are all buyers of this type of oil due to newer standards to reduce sulfur content in fuels," said Esa Ramasamy, an analyst with S&P Global Platts.

Ramasamy said 65 percent of Brazil's output is medium-sweet grades and most of the country's new production will be of the same type.

Petrobras produced 2.14 million bpd in 2016 and targets 2.77 million bpd by 2021. The company, which is trying to reduce debt of around $100 billion, is pouring all its efforts into the high-yield subsalt region.

Shell, the second largest producer in Brazil after Petrobras, is pumping around 295,000 bpd and wants to quadruple that in three years. The company is part of a consortium that will explore the giant Libra subsalt prospect, along with Petrobras, France's Total SA and China's CNOOC Ltd <0883.HK> and China National Petroleum Corp <601857.SS>.

March shipping data shows PetroChina moving a 130,000-tonne tanker from Brazil to China. Commodity trader Vitol [VITOLV.UL] also has two tankers carrying 260,000 tonnes of Brazilian crude, and Shell and Repsol SA have 560,000 tonnes, also heading to China.

Wood Mackenzie analyst Ixchel Castro said exports also have been boosted by weaker domestic consumption from the country's deepest recession on record. An economic recovery could siphon some of the exports.
