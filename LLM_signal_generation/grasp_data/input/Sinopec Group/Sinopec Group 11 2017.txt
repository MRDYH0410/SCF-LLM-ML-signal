{{20171201T082628.072+0000}}Asia Tankers-VLCC rates to remain under pressure, U.S. trade to grow* MidEast rates fall below break-even levels

* Oil producers pact will mean more long-haul U.S. volumes -Frontline

* Currently about 25-30 U.S.-Caribbean cargoes are shipped a month - brokers

By Keith Wallis

SINGAPORE, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Charter rates for very large crude carriers (VLCCs), which fell below break-even levels on routes from the Middle East this week, are expected to remain under pressure as too many ships chase too few cargoes, brokers said.

"This is the worst in terms of earnings sentiment for winter. Wake me up when December ends," said a Singapore-based supertanker broker on Friday.

That came as major oil producers agreed on Thursday to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018 in a move that is expected to open the market to increased crude volumes from the United States and other exporters. [nL8N1O01I9]

Increased exports from the United States could potentially support VLCC rates because longer voyage distances to Asia would cut the number of vessels available for charter.

"The effect (of the output cuts) we have found neutral as the reduction in Middle East export volumes was replaced by increased volumes from Atlantic Basin," said Robert Hvide Macleod, chief executive of leading tanker owner Frontline Management.

Macleod told Reuters that as a result of the continued cap "we believe the 'new trades' will develop further - long-term positive for shipping".

Unipec, the trading arm of Asia's largest oil refiner Sinopec <600028.SS>, signalled last week its intention to double the volume of U.S. oil it will import next year from 6 million tonnes this year. [nL3N1NU1SB]

There are around 24-30 VLCC cargoes a month from the U.S.-Caribbean region, brokers said.

"With crude from the Caribbean-U.S. Gulf area being heavy sour crude it will only find a home - China and India - which have the refineries that can process them," said Ashok Sharma, managing director of Singapore shipbroker BRS Baxi Far East.

"There is not going to be an instant reflex in the tanker markets to the oil producers' decision on Thursday. But shale oil producers will increase production," Sharma said.

Brokers estimated there were an average of around 15 fewer VLCC cargoes per month from the Middle East since the cuts were implemented in January.

That, together with the delivery of around 52 new VLCCs this year, has increased the number of ships available for charter, putting pressure on freight rates.

Supertanker earnings for a voyage from the Middle East to Japan dropped to around $18,200 per day on Thursday, compared with $32,600 per day at the fourth quarter peak on Oct. 17, data on the Reuters Eikon terminal showed.

That compared with daily break-even costs of $20,000-$22,000, brokers said.

"Rates of under $20,000 a day for December loading have not been seen for a long time," Sharma added.

VLCC rates on the Middle East-to-Japan route <.BAGJ> dropped to 56.50 on the Worldscale measure on Thursday, the lowest since Sept. 29, from W63.50 last week.

Rates on the West Africa-to-China route <.BAWC> fell to around W64 on Thursday, against W66.50 the same day last week.

Charter rates for an 80,000-deadweight-tonne Aframax tanker from Southeast Asia to East Coast Australia <.BAIJ> slipped to W109.25 on Thursday from W112.50 last week.

* Margin for teapots at best level in two years

* Larger teapots run at full capacity to meet domestic demand

* State-owned refiners ramp up fuel shipments on fresh quotas

* Start-up of two large refineries could end high margins

By Meng Meng and Chen Aizhu

BEIJING, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Chinese oil refiners are churning out record amounts of fuel in the last quarter of 2017, looking to cash in on the best refining profits in nearly two years after a rally in diesel and gasoline prices.

Officials at five state-owned oil processors said they are refining and shipping as much product as possible after receiving generous export quotas. [nB9N1MZ00B] [nL4N1N744W]

That is creating a domestic shortage that China's independent refiners - often called teapots - are rushing to meet, while also raising their output to profit from a hike in state-controlled gasoline and diesel retail prices. [nB9N1MZ00E]

"With major oil companies ramping up exports to use their additional quota, regions such as northeastern provinces showed tightness, giving teapots more space to sell their products domestically," said Gao Jian, an oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group.

Wholesales diesel prices quoted by major independent refiners gained about 600 yuan ($90.40) in the last two weeks to 6,600 yuan ($994.40) a tonne, while gasoline prices rose to 6,300 yuan ($949.20) a tonne, both hitting the highest level in two years, data from Zibo Longzhong Information Group showed.

Four independent refiners in Shandong, with a combined 18 million tonnes of annual crude processing capacity are pushing out as much diesel and gasoline as possible due to strong domestic demand, said officials at the processing plants.

The uptake is resulting in low fuel inventories at the refineries ahead of winter, and they will likely need to keep run rates high to replenish stocks. This tightening has also lifted refining margins.

Profits at the independents to process a tonne of crude rose to 800 yuan ($120.49) a tonne this month, highest since early 2016, data provided by China's Sublime Information Group showed.

For state-owned majors, margins to process Daqing crude touched 710 yuan a tonne, best level in a year, according to data from Zibo Longzhong Information Group.

The higher profits come despite a 40 percent surge in underlying crude prices since July. [O/R]

With margins higher, China's refiners raised overall crude processing to near record levels in October, with runs rising by 7.4 percent from September to 50.51 million tonnes. [nL3N1NK1LM]

The margins are a turnaround for the independents, who struggled to break even this summer amid a pricing war with major refiners Sinopec <600028.SS> and PetroChina <601857.SS>. [nL3N1JC28Z]

Sinopec and PetroChina own the five refineries that officials said were pumping up runs to maximize fuel exports.

RUNNING UNTIL THE PARTY ENDS

Chinese refiners are also benefiting from a crackdown on illegal fuel sellers, as well as environmental controls that have hit small chemical plants that sell fuel.

"The environmental campaign shut down many of the smaller chemical plants, which helped lift our sales," said a manager with Shandong Dongming Petrochemicals, one of teapots raising crude runs to profit in the current market.

To cash in on the higher margins as much as possible, some state refiners are buying fuel from private competitors to sell abroad, further draining local fuel inventories.

"Recent buying led by Sinopec's procurement division helped draw stocks of both gasoline and diesel to razor thin," a manager with Shandong Fuhai Industrial Co.

Shandong Fuhai and Shandong Wonfull PetroChemical Group were two of the other teapot refiners bumping up throughput.

The high refinery runs will add to China's crude oil imports, currently on track to top United States' imports this year for the first time on an annual basis. [nL4N1MO1MM]

That trend isn't likely to end, with the independents getting a boost in their 2018 crude import quotas. [nL3N1NE1IG]

The profit party could end soon, though, with refining officials saying margins are under threat from the start-ups at PetroChina's Yunnan refinery and CNOOC's <0883.HK> Huizhou refinery. [nL3N1NK278] [nL4N1MK0RM]

Still, a manager with a 5 million tonne-per-year private refinery said his plant will try to make the good times last.

"As long as we make good margin, we will churn out products at full speed," said the manager, declining to be named.

{{20171116T041905.480+0000}}UPDATE 1-China's Sinopec to supply 15.1 bcm of gas for winter, up 13 pct y/y* Sinopec ramps up winter gas supplies by 13 pct

* Sinopec to run gas field, LNG terminals at full capacity

* Demand from residents, gas power plants increase in winter

(Adds quote, details of gas supply)

BEIJING, Nov 16 (Reuters) - China's Sinopec <600028.SS> expects to supply 15.1 billon cubic metres of natural gas for winter and early spring amid surging demand from a government push to gasify northern cities, the company said on Thursday.

The supply volume is up 13 percent from the year-ago period, Sinopec said.

"In winter heating season, we expect residential gas consumption to surge in northern China. In southern China, demand from gas-fired power plants will also increase significantly," the oil and gas operator said in a statement.

Sinopec said it will run its four major gas fields, including Puguang, Fuling, Yuanba and Daniu, at full capacity and will pipe 5.9 bcm through the Sichuan to eastern China natural gas arteries. Another 4 bcm of supply will go through Sinopec's north China pipeline.

The producer also plans to operate its liquefied natural gas terminals at full capacity and fill up all the storage facilities before heating starts.

Sinopec said it will speed up the construction of key shale gas projects, such as the Fuling and Pingqiao shale gas blocks in in southwestern Sichuan province.

Unipec, Vitol place lowest offers in Bangladesh oil import tender -sources - 路透新闻

{{20171114T064710.743+0000}}Unipec, Vitol place lowest offers in Bangladesh oil import tender -sources* Unipec, Vitol look set to win tender

* BPC has resumed issuing tenders after 15-year hiatus

* Gas shortages have forced BPC to turn to oil-fired power plants

By Jessica Jaganathan and Ruma Paul

SINGAPORE/DHAKA, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Oil traders Unipec and Vitol placed the lowest offers in a tender by Bangladesh Petroleum Corp to buy up to 1.27 million tonnes of oil products for import in the first half of 2018, three industry sources said on Tuesday.

The state-owned company was seeking 780,000 to 980,000 tonnes of gasoil with sulphur content of no more than 500 parts per million (ppm), 100,000 tonnes of jet fuel, 120,000 to 160,000 tonnes of 180-cst high sulphur fuel oil and 30,000 tonnes of 95-octane gasoline.

Unipec, the trading arm of China's state-owned Sinopec <600028.SS>, placed the lowest offer for the gasoil and jet fuel cargoes beating six other companies, two of the sources said. They declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media.

It placed an offer of $2.76 a barrel above benchmark gasoil quotes and $3.34 a barrel above benchmark jet fuel quotes for 390,000 to 490,000 tonnes of 500 ppm sulphur gasoil and 50,000 tonnes of jet fuel, according to those two sources.

The trader also placed an offer of $2.42 a barrel above benchmark gasoil quotes and $3.34 a barrel above benchmark jet fuel quotes for similar volumes of gasoil and jet fuel, they added.

Vitol made the lowest offer for fuel oil and gasoline cargoes out of four other companies.

The Swiss oil trader placed an offer of $31.29 a tonne above benchmark fuel oil quotes for 120,000 to 160,000 tonnes of high sulphur furnace oil and an offer of $4.47 a barrel above benchmark gasoline quotes for 30,000 tonnes of 95-octane gasoline.

"Unipec is likely to win the tender for both gasoil and jet fuel, while Vitol will win the tender for fuel oil and gasoline," a BPC official told Reuters on Tuesday.

"The deal will be finalised by the end of this month after verifying all other details," the official added.

Sinopec was not immediately available for comment, while Vitol did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The tender closed on Nov. 13 and was expected to be valid for 75 days to Jan. 26, 2018. [nL4N1N72O3]

BPC resumed issuing tenders for long-term contracts in February, 2016 after a 15-year hiatus, during which it negotiated directly with suppliers of fuel products. [nL4N1DM2E2]

It wants to move away from direct deals as part of efforts to buy at cheaper rates.

A shortfall in supplies of natural gas has forced the South Asian country to burn oil, a costlier option, to generate electricity.

BRIEF-Sinopec to hold LNG auction as China's winter heating season nears - Reuters News

{{20171110T105144.624+0000}}BRIEF-Sinopec to hold LNG auction as China's winter heating season nearsBEIJING, Nov 10 (Reuters) - A unit of China's Sinopec Group will hold a liquefied natural gas (LNG) auction on the Shanghai Petroleum and Gas Exchange (SHPGX) on Nov. 14, the exchange said on Friday, without revealing the volume on offer.

Potential buyers are invited to submit bids to Sinopec's Guangxi gas sales subsidiary from 0900-1130 Beijing time (0100-0330 GMT) and 1330-1500 (0530-0700 GMT) on that day, the SHPGX said in a statement on its website.

The auction comes on the eve of China's peak winter heating season, which gets under way in mid-November, and amid warnings of severe gas shortages in the coming months. [nB9N1ML01M]

This winter, millions of homes across the colder northern regions will be heated by gas instead of coal for the first time, as part of Beijing's efforts to boost clean fuel use.[nL4N1MU1BU]

UPDATE 4-'We're engaged': Alaska gets China backing for natural gas project - Reuters News

* Bank of China, CIC also on board

* Deal comes as China needs more LNG in clean fuel push

* Project's high costs are an issue - Wood Mac

By Josephine Mason

BEIJING, Nov 9 (Reuters) - China's biggest state oil company Sinopec, one of the country's top banks and its sovereign wealth fund agreed on Thursday to develop a $43 billion natural gas project in Alaska, as the cash-poor U.S. state seeks to revive its dwindling energy industry.

The deal had been in the works since April and was sealed during U.S. President Donald Trump's state visit to China. It is the second-largest pact among a slew of agreements signed during the trip between the world's top two economies that are worth as much as $250 billion. [nL3N1NF31U]

Sinopec <601988.SS>, China Investment Corp [CIC.UL] and the Bank of China <601988.SS> will work over the next year with the state government to hammer out the details of their involvement in the Alaska LNG project, according to a statement from project sponsor Alaska Gasline Development Corp (AGDC).

Alaska LNG is designed to carry natural gas from fields in the North Slope through an 800-mile (1,287 km) pipeline to south central Alaska for in-state use and to a liquefaction plant to produce up to 20 million tons of LNG per year for export. [nL2N1N10A5]

Sinopec will buy some of the LNG and may supply engineering work for the project's construction, Bank of China will provide funding and CIC may take an equity stake, Alaskan Governor Bill Walker said on a call with reporters. AGDC will remain a majority shareholder, he said.

Alaska created AGDC in 2010 to build the project to tap the North Slope gas reserves, where production is expected to average about 3.5 billion cubic feet per day, according to Alaska LNG's website.

Alaska aims to shore up its oil and gas sector, which has struggled to compete with lower-cost shale projects in states such as Texas. Securing a Chinese customer, lender and investor would help Alaska overcome a multi-billion dollar budget deficit and create jobs. [nL1N1J4019]

"It's been a long courtship with these folks," said AGDC President Keith Meyer on the call. "We're now engaged."

The LNG will meet China's growing appetite for cleaner-burning fuels as the government tries to wean the country off coal to reduce air pollution. The Trump administration has touted natural gas exports from the United States as a way to reduce its trade deficits and boost domestic employment. [nL3N1NF2VM]

A final investment decision (FID) for Alaska LNG is expected in the first quarter of 2019, with construction starting in the same year and the first cargo expected around 2024 to 2025.

Most of the gas from Alaska LNG is expected to go to China, with Sinopec also helping with the marketing, although AGDC is also speaking to Japan, South Korea and Vietnam about potential off take, Meyer said.

Another energy-rich state, West Virginia, signed a memorandum of understanding with China Energy Investment Corp, the world's largest power company by asset value. [nL3N1NF375]

At the signing ceremony, Chinese President Xi Jinping said one of the world's top energy markets will expand its imports of LNG and crude oil from the United States. [nL3N1NF4HT]

ECONOMIC BOOM

Alaska has the advantage of being closer to China than LNG projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast, but its main issue is its high cost, said Kerry-Anne Shanks, head of Asia gas and LNG research at Wood Mackenzie.

"Sinopec may be able to secure cheaper LNG supply elsewhere," she said in a note.

Alaska Governor Walker said the project will generate $8 billion to $10 billion in revenue each year, including $1 billion from gas sales.

"This is an agreement that will provide Alaska with an economic boom comparable to the development of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System in the 1970s," Walker said in a statement. [nL3N1NF31U] [nL2N1L10PZ]

The U.S. State Department said in a separate statement the project will create up to 12,000 jobs during construction and reduce the trade deficit between the U.S. and Asia.

BEIJING, Nov 9 (Reuters) - China's top state oil major Sinopec, one of the country's top banks and its sovereign wealth fund have agreed to help develop Alaska's liquefied natural gas sector as part of U.S. President Donald Trump's visit, the U.S. government said on Thursday.

Alaska Gasline Development Corp (AGDC), the State of Alaska, Sinopec <601988.SS>, China Investment Corp [CIC.UL] and the Bank of China <601988.SS> have signed an agreement to advance (LNG) in Alaska, the U.S. government said in an email.

The agreement will involve investment of up to $43 billion, create up to 12,000 U.S. jobs during construction, reduce the trade deficit between the United States and Asia by $10 billion a year, and give China clean energy, it said.

There were no other details.

AGDC is building a gas treatment plant, an 800-mile (1,287 km) pipeline to south central Alaska for in-state use, and a liquefaction plant in Nikiski to produce up to 20 million tons of LNG per year for export. [nL2N1N10A5]

China, the world's third-largest gas buyer, is importing more LNG as the government tries to wean the country off dirty coal as part of its push to clear the skies, while the United States wants to sell more of its excess gas abroad.

Stepping on the gas: China's truckers scramble to meet LNG demand - Reuters News

{{20171107T073001.689+0000}}Stepping on the gas: China's truckers scramble to meet LNG demandBy Chen Aizhu

CAOFEIDIAN, China, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Li Ruipeng's phone has been ringing off the hook with factories and hotels looking to get their hands on prompt supplies of gas.

"Orders started to shoot up from September. Some are asking for deliveries the very next day," said Li, a manager with privately run Huapu Gas, which delivers super-chilled gas by truck to customers within a 500-km (310 mile) radius of its base in Tangshan, east of Beijing.

Huapu is one of a fast-growing band of trucking companies that are transforming China's once-sleepy domestic spot market for gas into a unique and bustling business as Beijing pushes to wean the country off coal.

Hotels, hospitals and factories have been forced to swap their coal-fired boilers for gas ones this year, creating thousands of new standalone gas customers thirsty for the clean fuel. [nL4N1MU1BU]

But with inadequate pipelines and storage tanks, users in the world's second-largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) importer are scrambling for supplies of imported and locally produced gas from dealers like Li.

He's currently dispatching nearly 40 trailers a day, each carrying 20 metric tonnes of LNG. That's double the number six months ago, with customers lured by quick delivery and the chance to bypass higher government-set prices for pipeline gas.

"Inflexible pricing for pipeline gas, insufficient grid network and lack of storage facilities ... make trucked LNG a unique business in China," said Chen Zhu, managing director of consultancy SIA Energy.

TRAILER BREAK

The trend is a major break from the global industry norm, where buyers and sellers are locked into long-term contracts - some as long as 20 years - and rely on pipeline grids to deliver the fuel.

China's first gas trailer hit the road in 2003 as trucks run by companies like Guanghui Energy <600256.SS> travelled for over a week to ship gas from remote northwestern onshore fields to factories 5,000 kms (3,000 miles) to the south.

Now, Li and his peers are expected to play a critical role in keeping the world's most populous nation fueled this winter as it embarks on an experiment to heat homes in nearly 30 northern cities with gas.

The additional demand has boosted spot gas prices over the past month and industrial users have struggled to get their hands on supplies. [nL4N1N13WH] [nL4N1N91MY]

Gas hauled by trailers could make up a tenth of China's total gas consumption of around 240 billion cubic metres (bcm) in 2017, compared with 5.6 percent in 2014, said Chen.

And China aims to lift gas to supply 15 percent of its total energy demand by 2030, more than double the current 6 percent.

CHILLED AND LOADED

Much of the fast-paced dealmaking for spot LNG is unique to China, with Li closing deals on the phone based on prices published by industry monitors on the popular Wechat messaging platform.

A specialist in delivering imported gas, his company secures gas under an annual contract with a nearby CNOOC-operated LNG terminal in Tianjin and also spot cargoes from Caofeidian, supplying customers by trailers loaded with 13-metre long tanks storing the chilled gas.

Gas distributors like the country's largest player ENN Energy Holdings <2688.HK> and niche dealers like Huapu have spent heavily this year expanding their fleet of trailers, each costing nearly a million yuan ($150,300).

Zhangjiagang-based cryogenic equipment maker Santum, controlled by CIMC Enric <3899.HK>, the country's top producer of LNG trailers, sold 600 vehicles in the first nine months of this year, up from 410 in all of 2016.

"We've got yet another 580 trailers ordered for the rest of the year, but realistically we could only deliver those by next March," said a marketing manager with Santum, who estimated some 9,000 trailers now roam the country's highways.

IMPORTS SOAR

Surging spot LNG prices amid concerns about winter demand have drawn in rare shipments from as far as Norway and the United States. [nL2N1MN0A5]

During a recent visit to PetroChina's <0857.HK> gas import terminal at Caofeidian, a district of Tangshan, trailers lined up in a sprawling car park hours before an LNG vessel from Australia docked at the jetty.

A key receiving point for imported gas, trucked LNG sales from Caofeidian soared to 480 million cubic metres by mid-October, already up sixfold from all of 2016, according to PetroChina Jintang LNG Co Ltd which operates the terminal.

"We had to double our staffing for the pump stations and work shifts to fill the trucks," said Gu Wenwen, office manager for PetroChina Jingtang LNG.

Li, whose company plans to double its fleet of trailers, says business will only become more frenzied.

"I am talking so frequently on my phone of the transactions even my five-year daughter knows about LNG prices!" he said.

During a recent visit to PetroChina's <0857.HK> gas import terminal at Caofeidian, a district of Tangshan, trailers lined up in a sprawling car park hours before an LNG vessel from Australia docked at the jetty.

A key receiving point for imported gas, trucked LNG sales from Caofeidian soared to 480 million cubic metres by mid-October, already up sixfold from all of 2016, according to PetroChina Jintang LNG Co Ltd which operates the terminal.

"We had to double our staffing for the pump stations and work shifts to fill the trucks," said Gu Wenwen, office manager for PetroChina Jingtang LNG.

Li, whose company plans to double its fleet of trailers, says business will only become more frenzied.

"I am talking so frequently on my phone of the transactions even my five-year daughter knows about LNG prices!" he said.

{{20171103T063103.848+0000}}GRAPHIC-As China faces winter gas crunch, LNG prices soar* In unusual move, LNG spot prices jump above oil-linked prices

* China's huge gasification programme sends imports soaring

* China's LNG imports expected to hit new record this winter

By Henning Gloystein and Meng Meng

SINGAPORE/BEIJING, Nov 3 (Reuters) - China is hoovering up liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargoes worldwide, pushing spot prices for the fuel above those for oil-indexed cargoes, as energy providers scramble to avoid a looming winter supply crunch.

China has moved millions of households from burning dirty coal to natural gas this year, pushing up import demand amid an already tightening overall Asian market. [nL2N1M80BL]

Most Asian LNG supplies are delivered under long-term contracts with prices linked to crude oil.

But with the upcoming winter heating season, Chinese utilities have turned to the spot market in desperation to cover themselves in order to meet surging demand, chartering tankers from as far away as Norway. [nL2N1MN0A5][nL4N1MO1MM]

"We expect (China's national oil and gas majors) CNOOC, PetroChina <601857.SS>, and Sinopec <600028.SS> to buy 30 percent more (LNG) on the spot market in the coming three months compared with last year, to help boost supplies," said Jiang Jin, gas analyst at JLC Energy.

"LNG terminals are running at full capacity," she added.

A similar short-term supply crunch late last year boosted spot Asian LNG prices by more than 80 in the last four months of the year, and pushed China's December 2016 imports to a record 3.7 million tonnes, nearly double the 2016 average of just 2 million tonnes a month.

With millions more households having moved to gas since then, last year's record is expected to be smashed this year.

"The Chinese are in panic mode. They clearly underestimated the push in demand from their gasification programme. Now they are soaking up LNG spot cargoes where they can. And suppliers are happy to deliver, at a premium," said a trader with a major commodity merchant.

Asian spot LNG prices have soared by more than two-thirds since May to $9 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), above oil-linked prices of around $8 per mmBtu.

"I'm fairly certain China will break a new import record very soon and that spot prices will break through $10," the trader said, declining to be named as he is not allowed to talk about publicly pricing.

Unlike coal or oil, where China is the world's biggest importer, the country is only the number three buyer of LNG behind South Korea and Japan.

But its gasification programme is set to change that.

"Beijing reiterated its commitment to growing the share of natural gas in the domestic energy mix in the recently held 9th National Party Congress as part of a broader move to tackle air pollution," BMI Research said on Friday.

The scale of China's soaring gas demand can be seen in the major industrial province of Hebei.

"Hebei province alone needs an extra 2 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas for heating because of mandatory measures to switch industrial and residential boilers to use natural gas," JLC's Jiang said, referring to winter demand.

That's the equivalent of 870,000 tonnes of extra LNG, equal to almost a quarter of the country's total demand.

Quarter of oil refineries risk closure under climate goals -report - Reuters News

{{20171102T000101.058+0000}}Quarter of oil refineries risk closure under climate goals -report* Refining profits to shrivel as demand drops, report says

* Sector faces heavy over capacity -Carbon Tracker

* Targets to reduce carbon emissions however seem distant

By Ron Bousso

LONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - A quarter of the world's oil refineries risk closure by 2035 if governments meet targets to limit fossil fuel burning in the fight against global warming, a report released on Thursday said.

A surge in electric vehicle sales and higher efficiency in internal combustion and jet engines are expected to slow demand growth for fuels such as gasoline, diesel and aviation fuel in the coming decades, potentially putting pressure on refining profits.

At the same time, governments around the world are set to introduce legislation in the coming years to limit emissions of heat-capturing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in order to meet targets set at a U.N-backed Paris conference in 2015.

As a result, companies such as Chevron , Royal Dutch Shell , France' Total and China's largest refiner Sinopec could see profits from refining drop by 70 percent or more over the period, according to the report co-authored by environment thinktank Carbon Tracker, Swedish investment fund AP7 and Danish pension fund PKA.

The study is based on the International Energy Agency's 450 Scenario to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius under which oil demand declines by 23 percent between 2020 and 2035.

Under this scenario, despite new refinery additions in Asia and the Middle East, only 62 percent of global capacity will be required to meet demand compared with around 80 percent today. Profits from converting crude oil into refined products will also shrink.

That in turn means that approximately one quarter of the 2016 refining capacity, the equivalent of some 24.7 million barrels per day of oil demand, will need to be closed, the report said.

The closures would likely be more pronounced in developed economies where oil demand is expected to peak earlier than in developing economies. Also, modern, complex refineries that can produce more high quality and cleaner fuels are likely to fare better than older plants.

"The consequences of achieving a 2 degree Celsius world are far more detrimental to the refining sector than the upstream sector, as it results in structural over-capacity and associated poor refining margin environment, which can only be addressed by sustained capacity rationalisation," said Alan Gelder, vice president for research at Edinburgh-based consultancy Wood Mackenzie which took part in the report.

Meeting the emission reduction targets however seems distant today. A report published on Tuesday said global emissions are set to be 30 percent higher than the target needed by 2030.[nL8N1N640X]

While oil companies including Shell have acknowledged that demand for some fuels such as gasoline could peak by the end of the 2020s, they expect demand for oil to remain strong for decades from heavy transport, aviation and chemical production.

The authors of the report estimate that overall earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for refiners could fall by over 50 percent by 2035 from around $147 billion in 2015.

"We consider that prospective investors should be wary of all new refinery investments," the report said.

"When demand growth stalls and turns negative, new investments will carry the risk of failing to earn an adequate return."

Carbon Tracker and a group of investors warned in a report earlier this year that oil giants risk spending trillions by 2025 on oil and gas projects that won't be feasible under the international climate targets. [nL8N1JI1P9]

China issues 5 mln T fuel quotas in fifth release this year -sources - Reuters News

{{20171101T093926.587+0000}}China issues 5 mln T fuel quotas in fifth release this year -sourcesBEIJING/SINGAPORE, Nov 1 (Reuters) - China has approved five million tonnes of fuel export quotas for the rest of 2017 in the fifth release this year after refiners asked for additional permits to ship out surplus fuels, three traders with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.

The quotas will bring the total of permits this year to about 42.5 million tonnes, roughly 12 percent more than the actual exports of gasoline, diesel and jet kerosene combined for last year.

Of the total, CNPC wins about 2.2 million tonnes, Sinopec 1.3 million tonnes, CNOOC 1.2 million tonnes and Sinochem 300,000 tonnes, the traders said.

One trader said 60 percent of the quotas were allotted to diesel, the rest to gasoline and jet kerosene.

The Ministry of Commerce did not immediately comment. Neither did CNPC, CNOOC, Sinopec or Sinochem.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Wall Street loses in search for easy China wins - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20171101T035029.266+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Wall Street loses in search for easy China wins(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.) (Refiles to fix punctuation in third, fifth and sixth paragraphs, and to fix mispelling of "Cheniere Energy" in third paragraph.)

By Gina Chon

WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Finance services firms look sidelined as the White House focuses on finding easy China wins. Energy and industrial companies like General Electric will have a chance to cozy up to Beijing's new leadership during U.S. President Donald Trump's upcoming Asia trip, but Wall Street isn't coming along. The U.S. business delegation's composition reflects Trump's desires to find low-hanging fruit deals to tout domestically, but low expectations for deeper concessions.

Trump arrives in Beijing next Wednesday, and the administration has been on the hunt for announcements that would make for photo ops or press releases during his visit. Companies applying to join a business delegation were queried on whether they had deals with China in the works that they could unveil while overseas, people familiar with the matter told Breakingviews. Billions of dollars in sales and investments benefitting the United States are expected. For example, one of the stars of the show will probably be Sinopec's <0386.HK> <600028.SS> 700-mile pipeline deal in Texas and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which could be worth about $7 billion in investments.

U.S. corporate delegates include GE, Honeywell , Thermo Fisher and Cheniere Energy . They arrive at an opportune time to meet Chinese leaders, who just wrapped up a major party congress and rolled out new leadership slate at the end of October.

However, the United States remains locked in contentious talks over improving market access for American firms in the People's Republic, including financial services. A senior administration official said Tuesday that progress has become more difficult. China is retrenching under President Xi Jinping, who has shown scant respect for market-based principles.

While there have been some advances on raising ownership equity caps in financial services, a deal has not been finalized, and the lack of representation by big names like Citi or Goldman Sachs on this trip suggests no major compromise is nigh. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said he hoped the one-off deals don't overshadow the need to push for structural changes.

Convincing Beijing to expose its domestic financial industry to more foreign competition is a tougher pitch than selling goods. The Trump administration is not indifferent to the financial sector's concerns, but low expectations for photo-op concessions have kept the industry at the back of the line this time around.
