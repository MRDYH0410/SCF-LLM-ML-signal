* Chongqing to launch trade of pipeline gas, LNG in H1 2018

* Chongqing exchange rivals Shanghai hub, Japan Korean Marker

* Govt price regulation, lack of infrastructures are barriers

By Chen Aizhu and Henning Gloystein

CHONGQING, China/SINGAPORE, Dec 29 (Reuters) - China plans to launch a natural gas exchange in Chongqing in early 2018, aiming to create an Asian price benchmark as the nation's use of the fuel surges amid its shift away from coal.

China is the world's third-biggest consumer of natural gas behind the United States and Russia. An exchange in its fast-growing market would be a strong contender for an Asian gas marker off which other supplies in the region could be priced.

The Chongqing Oil and Gas Exchange - supported by state energy majors, and private and local government-backed gas distributors - would provide a trading platform for domestic output, pipeline imports from Central Asia and Myanmar, and imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

Chongqing is China's second attempt to develop a traded gas market, having set up a similar exchange in 2015 in Shanghai.

An Asian gas price benchmark to stand next to those of the United States and Europe is seen as a key missing piece in establishing a truly global market for natural gas.

"The exchange is a product of the government's reform push - to hand the pricing power to the market," Exchange Chairman Zhang Bowen told Reuters.

"The long-term goal is to build the exchange into a benchmark for Asia and to win China its deserved pricing power," said Zhang, who was previously president of PetroChina Kunlun Energy.

The exchange, led by a board of nine directors including a former PetroChina <601857.SS> executive and an ex-senior state planning official, expects to launch electronically-based spot trading of pipeline gas and LNG imports in the first half of next year. [L4N1OL276]

Registered in Chongqing municipality in July with 1 billion yuan ($150 million) in capital, the exchange has a team of 30, including former market developers at state-owned energy giants CNOOC and Sinopec <600028.SS>.

"A China gas hub certainly looks attractive from a supply/demand and infrastructure perspective," said Jeff Brown, president of consultancy Facts Global Energy (FGE).

Chongqing exchange is appraising around 200 potential members, mostly from the consuming hub of eastern China, and will be open to foreign participation in the longer run, said exchange executives.

PRICING CONTROLS A BARRIER

Still, there are several challenges to overcome, for Chongqing or any other exchanges hoping to establish an active gas trading platform. [nL8N1OM0IM]

"The biggest would be that the government is still heavily involved in 'guiding' prices. Access to pipelines and import terminals can also be difficult," said Brown.

China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) currently sets wholesale or city-gate gas prices by linking them to alternative fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and fuel oil.

Investors fear China could be as heavy-handed with gas as it has been with coal. Authorities have repeatedly intervened whenever coal prices have risen sharply, contributing to the virtual death of coal futures in Asia. [nL3N1HK3UG] [nL8N1LA1FG]

China is also struggling to build the infrastructure needed to freely distribute gas supplies. An inadequate pipeline grid and insufficient storage helped to trigger a supply crunch this winter after millions of households were switched from using coal to gas for heating. [nL4N1OK3PB]

"Pipelines need to be more connected and greater access allowed for third parties to the grid and terminals. More investments are needed to boost gas storage," Song Dacai, chairman of the Chongqing exchange's supervision committee and formerly a pricing official with the NDRC.

The exchange, though, is confident rising demand and slowly expanding gas infrastructure will help it succeed. [nL4N1DG1QU]

Chongqing, with its population of more than 30 million and proximity to Sichuan province's large gas basin, already has a relatively well-developed gas grid, and distributors there are keen to participate on the exchange.

"As an investor, we are keen to become a market maker, provided that suppliers are ready to post meaningful volumes for us to trade," said Luo Jing, deputy head of gas development at China Gas Holdings <0883.HK>, a piped gas distributor.

State majors are expected to nominate available volumes on the exchange annually or bi-annually, said Zhang, the exchange chairman.

BUT THERE ARE COMPETITORS

Others that are trying to develop regional gas exchanges as the basis for an Asian benchmark include Shanghai Petroleum and Gas Exchange and the Japan Korea Marker (JKM) by S&P Global Platts .

The Shanghai exchange, launched in 2015, has so far failed to attract much trading interest. China's financial hub, though, is seen as a potential oil and gas trading centre and likely home of China's long delayed crude oil derivatives contract. [nL3N1O54BY]

In many way, the JKM, an LNG price assessment, is seen as the strongest contender to become a regional gas benchmark.

"JKM seems to be gaining steam as an Asian gas price ... Since LNG is the most commoditised gas in Asia, it seems best placed to emerge as the Asia price marker," FGE's Brown said.

FACTBOX-China's Chongqing and Shanghai natural gas exchanges - 路透新闻

{{20171229T074834.373+0000}}FACTBOX-China's Chongqing and Shanghai natural gas exchangesBEIJING, Dec 29 (Reuters)

BEIJING, Dec 29 (Reuters) - China will launch a new natural gas trading exchange in Chongqing in early 2018, rival to a similar project in Shanghai. Beijing hopes at least one of the schemes will develop into a benchmark to price gas supplies across Asia. [nL4N1OK1ZJ]

The Shanghai exchange is trading wholesale pipeline gas denominated in yuan per cubic metre and liquefied natural gas (LNG) in yuan per tonne.

Chongqing is to announce product and contract details in the first half of next year. The exchanges are initially open only to domestic investors, but both plan to allow foreign participation eventually.

SHANGHAI PETROLEUM AND GAS EXCHANGE

Launched in early 2015 with a registered capital of one billion yuan ($150 million), the Shanghai exchange is backed by state news agency Xinhua; China's top three state oil majors Sinopec, China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and CNOOC; and five gas distributors, including China Gas Holdings <0384.HK>, ENN Group and state-run utility Huaneng Group [HUANP.UL].

Xinhua is the largest investor with a 33 percent stake.

Trade has been thin since the start-up two years ago, although liquidity picked up from this past September, ahead of a severe supply crunch in China this winter. Turnover on the exchange for 2017 is expected to top 50 billion cubic metres.

By comparison, 100 bcm to 200 bcm per month are typically traded on Britain's NBP, according to UK regulator Ofgem.

Shanghai sits at the receiving end of two national trunk-lines, one that starts in the remote northwest region of Xinjiang and the other from southwest Sichuan. Shanghai is also on China's east coast, which is dotted with about 15 LNG receiving terminals. [nL4N1IL2UB]

CHONGQING OIL AND GAS EXCHANGE

Registered in July with one billion yuan in capital, the exchange gathers 13 investors, with Chongqing Energy Investment Group [CHGQGC.UL] and state majors CNPC and Sinopec making up the core group, each holding a 13 percent stake.

Other smaller investors among the 10 remaining stakeholders, include private gas distributors China Gas Holdings, ENN Group, Hanas Group, regional government-backed Hubei Energy Group <000883.SZ> and Shanxi Yanchang Petroleum.

CITIC Securities <600030.SS> and state-owned fertilizer and chemicals maker Chongqing Chemical and Pharmaceutical Holding Group [CHGQGP.UL] are also among the investors.

The exchange plans for first trades of pipeline gas and LNG in the first half of 2018.

Chongqing is located in China's most prolific Sichuan gas basin and home to the country's largest shale gas development.

Chongqing's regional grid is connected to pipelines bringing in gas from Myanmar and Central Asia.

The exchange signed a non-binding agreement in November with Delfin Midstream to jointly develop a gas trading platform. [nL3N1NE29A]

UPDATE 1-China raises 1st batch of 2018 oil product export quotas by 30 pct - 路透新闻

{{20171228T090620.000+0000}}UPDATE 1-China raises 1st batch of 2018 oil product export quotas by 30 pctSINGAPORE, Dec 28 (Reuters)

* China issues 16.24 mln T general export quotas for oil
products

* Biggest allocation goes to Sinopec, follow by PetroChina

(Update with details, export quota table)

SINGAPORE, Dec 28 (Reuters) - China raised refined products
export quotas to its four state oil majors by 30 percent in the
first batch of allowances for 2018, a document reviewed by
Reuters showed on Thursday.

The notice did not include quotas for independent refiners,
also known as "teapots", the second year the private refiners
are being left out of the export scheme.

The state majors will receive total export quotas of 16.24
million tonnes under the general trade term for exporting 
gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, the Ministry of Commerce said in
a notice.

Asia's largest refiner, Sinopec <600028.SS>, has the biggest
quota share at 6.74 million tonnes, followed by PetroChina
<601857.SS> at 5.75 million tonnes.

Sinochem [SASADA.UL] and CNOOC <0883.HK> will be allowed to
export 2 million tonnes and 1.75 million tonnes of products,
respectively.

CNOOC also got a separate allowance to export 70,000 tonnes
of liquefied natural gas (LNG).

"The increase in quota showed oil majors are actively
applying for more allowance to export," said a China-based
trader who declined to be named.

"Due to weak domestic demand for gasoline and diesel, export
margins are better than the domestic margin," the trader said.

The trader also said he expects the commerce ministry to
issue separate export quotas for two refineries that will be
started up by Dalian Hengli Petrochemical and Zhejiang Rongsheng
Group next year. [nL3N1NE1IG]

China issued an allowance for 12.4 million tonnes in its
first batch of export quotas in 2017. [nL1N1EN07S]

UPDATE 1-Sinopec further lift supplies in China's gas crunch - 路透新闻

{{20171222T114202.677+0000}}UPDATE 1-Sinopec further lift supplies in China's gas crunchBEIJING, Dec 22 (Reuters)

(Adds new details)

BEIJING, Dec 22 (Reuters) - China's major oil and gas operator Sinopec stepped up efforts to increase domestic gas supplies as widespread shortages hit more cities this week.

Sinopec said it will increase upstream production by 1.1 million cubic metres per day and has hired 40 trucks to deliver LNG from its Beihai LNG terminal in south Guangxi province to northern China regions.

The latest move from Sinopec showed major producers are now in a scramble to ease the gas crunch that left residents freezing and factories shut.

Wuhan, a city in central China, started curbing residential consumption of gas as the crisis deepens.[nB9N1O7024] Chemical companies such as Yuantianhua based in southern Yunnan province also halted production line amid the gas shortage.[nL3N1OC370]

Sinopec said it will accelerate the construction of the key Tianjin LNG receiving terminal. The terminal is expected to provide 450 million cubic metres of LNG shipments every quarter.

In addition, the gas producer and pipeline operator has reduced supplies to industrial users by 3.9 million cubic metres per day to meet residential demand.

Sinopec said its two major storage tanks in eastern Jiangsu province and central Henan province have been fully filled.

Chinese officials point fingers as gasification crisis worsens - 路透新闻

{{20171222T072453.000+0000}}Chinese officials point fingers as gasification crisis worsensBEIJING, Dec 22 (Reuters)

* China switching millions over to gas from coal

* But gas supplies, infrastructure inadequate

* That has left many freezing at the start of winter

* Gas producers say weren't fully aware of govt. targets

* They say they greatly underestimated demand

By Meng Meng and Ryan Woo

BEIJING, Dec 22 (Reuters) - When an inspector from a local environmental protection bureau visited a small village in China's Shandong province in October to check on a gasification project, she said village officials became tearful in lamenting how far behind schedule they were.

For years, the village has been haunted by pollution from nearby coal mines and chemical plants. The village had been rushing to finish installing new gas boilers for residents as they ditched their old coal stoves, the inspector told Reuters.

The boilers are part of an ambitious gasification programme under which millions of households, and some industrial users, are switching from coal to natural gas for heating, as Beijing tries to clean the tainted air in northern China after decades of galloping growth.

The effect of the dramatic switch has been felt globally, with internationally shipped gas prices almost doubling this year to more than $10 per million British thermal units, the highest since the end of 2014.

It has also been felt locally due to poor coordination among government bodies and gas producers, and miscalculations in demand, which have sent gas prices soaring, left many residents freezing in their homes, and shuttered factories.

Where there is gas supply, it cannot reach homes in some cases as the replacement gas infrastructure has not been installed.

"Everyone's job is linked to whether we can meet the target," the environmental protection inspector said, declining to be named and refusing to identify the village due to sensitivity of the matter.

In China, policy targets are trickled down to the village official level with the objectives generally understood to be the minimum to be achieved.

"If we did not meet the target, we will get bad performance reviews and we will start worrying about our careers," the inspector said. She declined to specify the targets.

As the crisis escalates with China entering the coldest weeks of the year, local officials and fuel suppliers have started to point fingers, according to officials with whom Reuters spoke.

OVERSHOOTING

It is not uncommon for policies formulated by Beijing to be interpreted differently by local authorities and implemented in varying degrees and at varying speeds.

After coming to power in late 2012, President Xi Jinping warned local governments against taking measures at the grassroots level that are not aligned with national policies.

But overzealous officials can sometimes create problems.

Hebei province, for instance, has converted 2.3 million households to gas, far above the target for 1.8 million households, a senior provincial official told state-run China Youth Daily.

Executives from major gas suppliers Sinopec and PetroChina told Reuters inadequate communication between government officials and producers over the number and type of projects has caused them to underestimate the pace of the gas expansion programme this year.

"The number of gas projects were first reported to the county, then to the city, then the province and other central departments," said a Sinopec official, declining to be named.

"When it gets to us, it is almost too late to adjust our plans accordingly," he said.

UNDERESTIMATING

In early spring, the Sinopec official estimated that nationwide gas demand could rise as much as 30 billion cubic metres (bcm) this year versus a consensus estimate of less than 15 bcm.

The official said colleagues had initially dismissed his forecast, after three years of lacklustre sales and a warm spring had dampened gas consumption. But it turned out to be true. Gas consumption grew 18 percent in January-September, far outpacing the year-earlier rate.

"By the end of September, we got a sense that shortages were imminent," the official said. "Sinopec started operating pipelines at full capacity, but it was too late to avoid a gas crisis."

Energy consultancy IHS estimates China's 2017 imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) would rise 40 percent over 2016.

Shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows China's LNG imports could exceed 40 million tonnes this year, hitting a monthly record of 4.5 million tonnes in December.

China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and its listed unit PetroChina <0857.HK><601857.SS> were also surprised by the surge in demand.

CNPC, the country's largest producer, estimated in December 2016 that gas consumption would grow 5.9 percent in 2017. Instead, demand rose 19 percent in the first 11 months of this year.

A senior PetroChina official said he had raised concerns about demand, and lifted his consumption growth forecast to as much as 15 percent at senior management team meetings in late June. But his forecast was deemed inaccurate, based on historical trends.

"If we had better coordination with the government and started to prepare for this winter, we would not have such a big problem today," the PetroChina official said.

PetroChina and Sinopec declined to comment officially.

'REVEALING THE TRUTH'

On Monday, the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) published an infographic on its social media WeChat account showing Sinopec and CNPC were partly to blame for the deepening winter gas.

In a post called "Revealing the truth about the gas 'crisis'", the infographic showed the government's gasification programme was botched partly due to delays in the opening of Sinopec's Tianjin LNG terminal and reduced supplies from CNPC's Central Asia pipeline.

"If there is no problem on the gas supply side, demand from coal-to-gas households would be fully met," the MEP said in the infographic, citing an energy expert.

Ministry officials declined to comment for this story.

Executives at gas producers said they are struggling to invest more in costly storage facilities, which take millions of dollars and five to six years to build.

"You can't do things too fast," said Daniel Yergin, Vice Chairman of IHS Markit. "My understanding is that the constraints are pipeline distribution systems and storage and LNG receiving terminals."

BREAKINGVIEWS-Saudi Aramco's backup IPO plan runs through China - 路透新闻

{{20171219T091320.545+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Saudi Aramco's backup IPO plan runs through ChinaNEW YORK/HONG KONG, Dec 19 (Reuters Breakingviews)

(The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions expressed are their own.)

By Rob Cox and Pete Sweeney

NEW YORK/HONG KONG, Dec 19 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman is a crown prince in a hurry. Besides detaining members of his family in a corruption sweep and painting a high-tech vision of the kingdom's future, the young ruler-in-waiting is also planning to sell a chunk of the national oil company, Saudi Aramco, to international investors. For that to proceed in 2018, he'll need to choose a venue besides Riyadh for the listing early in the year. China looks like the best option.

Setting aside questions about Aramco's value, which the crown prince himself has pegged at an ambitious $2 trillion, there are hurdles to bringing what's likely to be the world's largest corporation to more traditional marketplaces.

Start with London. Britain is bending over backwards to bring Aramco to the London Stock Exchange . Prime Minister Theresa May and then-LSE chief Xavier Rolet traveled to Riyadh and lobbied Aramco's chairman for the business in April. Over the summer, the Financial Conduct Authority proposed to twist its rules to create a new listing category for companies controlled by sovereign states. Amid some resistance, the rules have yet to be finalized.

There's also an additional wrinkle. The LSE's biggest shareholder is the Qatar Investment Authority, the sovereign wealth fund of that country's al-Thani monarchy. Yet Saudi Arabia launched a trade and economic boycott of Qatar in early 2017, alongside other Gulf nations. The crown prince, in an interview with Reuters Breakingviews in October, called Qatar's investment a "very, very, very small issue." But that still signals it's an issue.

New York has a different problem. President Donald Trump took to Twitter in November to extol the benefits of a U.S. listing. But Saudi Arabia could fall foul of the U.S. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA. The law passed by Congress in 2016 would allow Americans to sue the Saudi government for damages, on the alleged grounds it helped to plan the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Aramco's New York presence would make it the biggest target for the plaintiffs' bar in American legal history.

CHINESE BACKUP

All of which raises the possibility of Hong Kong's role in Aramco's future. The Chinese city is morphing from a mere back-up plan to a potential front-runner among the deal's backers.

One reason is flexibility. Though the Hong Kong exchange would need to bend some rules to allow Aramco to list, Chief Executive Charles Li is loudly signaling his eagerness. He's pushing a new program called "Primary Connect," which would allow mainland Chinese investors to buy into initial public offerings in the special administrative region's exchange. Li says that's "key" to closing the Saudi float.

Even without the Connect – which would require Beijing's approval, too - the exchange has other advantages. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing <0388.HK> is a for-profit company trading publicly in Hong Kong, which regulates listings on the very board on which its own stock trades. It is in its business interest to grant the oil giant an exception to its requirement that companies list a minimum of 25 percent of their stock - something that would instantly render Aramco the largest member of the Hang Seng Index by a margin of around $200 billion.

A 5 percent free float would be easier to swallow. At $100 billion, it would leave the company adjacent to insurer AIA <1299.HK>, politely leaving mainland tech champion Tencent <0700.HK> in first place. Exchange executives would have to deem the Tadawul exchange in Riyadh to offer standards of shareholder protection "equivalent to those provided in Hong Kong," but that is unlikely to take long.

The other thing the city can offer is a roster of Chinese state-owned financial gorillas, potentially ready to invest on terms that will give the crown prince the valuation he wants – and not too fussed about transparency. Reuters reported in April that a consortium of government oil giants like PetroChina <601857.SS> <0857.HK> and Sinopec <600028.SS>, major banks and the $800 billion sovereign wealth fund could be rallied to serve as cornerstone investors.

If Aramco does choose Hong Kong, it could signal a political shift. China's interest in the relationship with Saudi Arabia is strategic, focused on offsetting American influence in the Middle East, and on achieving greater leverage over energy prices. It is therefore likely to ask for a quid pro quo, such as oil-price concessions, supply guarantees, or even denominating oil contracts in yuan instead of dollars. The latter could set off unpredictable changes in global energy and currency prices, and alienate the United States, Saudi Arabia's primary security guarantor.

The biggest risk might be embarrassment. Non-Chinese companies haven't done too well out of secondary listings in Hong Kong of late: Swiss miner Glencore and U.S. luxury brand Coach – now known as Tapestry - took down their tickers in late 2017, blaming tepid turnover. There have also been numerous scandals surrounding IPOs by mainland firms. If nobody trades the stock, share prices could struggle to stay in natural sync with the Tadawul, which is unlikely to see much volume.

No matter the reception in secondary markets, an Aramco listing in Hong Kong would be rich in irony: a marriage of convenience between an atheist communist bureaucracy and a monarch from the theological heart of Sunni Islam – united by a preference for opacity.

UPDATE 1-China asks energy firms to cut gas supply to some industries by 15 mln cubic metres per day - 路透新闻

{{20171218T062123.000+0000}}UPDATE 1-China asks energy firms to cut gas supply to some industries by 15 mln cubic metres per dayBEIJING, Dec 18 (Reuters)

* Move comes amid crunch in gas supply in China

* Will cover supply to chemical producers, others

* China also plans to purchase more gas overseas

(Adds detail)

BEIJING, Dec 18 (Reuters) - China's state planner on Monday said it had asked national energy majors CNPC, Sinopec <600028.SS> and CNOOC <0883.HK> to cut natural gas supplies to some industries by a total of about 15 million cubic metres per day.

The move comes amid a shortage of gas in the world's No.2 economy after an unprecedented campaign to help clean up the environment by switching millions of households to natural gas from coal for heating. [nL3N1O83EN]

The government has previously said that supply to industry would be curbed, but Monday's announcement - covering makers of products such as chemicals, methanol and fertiliser - gives an indication of the targetted size of such cuts.

Meng Wei, spokeswoman for the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), also said at a briefing on Monday that the government had coordinated with the three major energy companies to increase supplies by raising gas output, boosting imports and speeding up infrastructure construction.

She added that China planned to purchase 3.5 billion cubic metres of liquefied natural gas in overseas markets in addition to its original plan to import 24.5 billion cubic metres over the winter.

The nation has also been sending 14 million cubic metres of gas per day to its frigid north from the south, with plans to boost that to around 19 million tonnes per day, said Meng.

CNOOC has rented a convoy of 100 trucks to ship liquefied natural gas (LNG) the length of the country to northern regions in the latest unusual, and costly, move to ease the deepening fuel crisis. [nL4N1OF1HX]

Venezuela's PDVSA settles lawsuit with China's Sinopec - 路透新闻

{{20171212T210729.462+0000}}Venezuela's PDVSA settles lawsuit with China's SinopecDec 12 (Reuters) - Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA has agreed to pay a subsidiary of its Chinese counterpart Sinopec <600028.SS> $21.5 million owed for a 2012 steel rebar order, quickly settling a Nov. 27 lawsuit, according to court papers.

China has been one of Venezuela's biggest financial backers, lending it more than $50 billion over the past decade. Its lawsuit against PDVSA, claiming breach of contract and conspiracy to defraud, was interpreted by experts as a sign that the Chinese powerhouse was losing patience with the cash-strapped government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. [nL1N1O70EU]

Under the settlement in U.S. District Court in Houston on Monday and seen on Tuesday, PDVSA agreed to pay Sinopec USA the remaining half of a $43.5 million purchase order in two instalments, one on Dec. 14 and the other on Jan. 15, 2018.

Even in the context of delayed debt payments by Venezuela, Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez of Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management said "when you think about the cash flow at PDVSA, it's not a difficult sum to pay."

The amount, which does not include an additional $2.2 million Sinopec had requested to cover litigation and administrative costs, will be paid in Chinese renminbi.

In the agreement, PDVSA said the payment does not imply "acknowledgment of fault or responsibility" but was for the sole purpose of ending the controversy between the two parties.

Sinopec told the court it was dismissing the claims against PDVSA following the settlement.

UPDATE 4-World is losing the battle against climate change, Macron says - 路透新闻

{{20171212T180457.587+0000}}UPDATE 4-World is losing the battle against climate change, Macron says* Summit takes place on 2-year anniversary of Paris climate deal

* Macron gives bleak assessment says: "We all need to act"

* Trump has said he plans to take U.S. out of Paris agreement

* Investors say will put more pressure on global companies

(Adds ActionAid USA, details on commitments)

By Richard Lough and Michel Rose

PARIS, Dec 12 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron delivered a bleak assessment on the global fight against climate change to dozens of world leaders and company executives on Tuesday, telling them: "We are losing the battle".

"We're not moving quickly enough. We all need to act," Macron said, seeking to breathe new life into a collective effort that was weakened this summer when President Donald Trump said he was pulling the United States out of an international accord brokered in the French capital two years ago.

Macron, who has worked to establish his role as a global leader since his sweeping election win in May, said modern-day science was revealing with each day the danger that global warming posed to the planet, he said.

"We are losing the battle," he said, urging a new phase in the fight against global warming.

France announced a raft of 12 non-binding commitments, from a $300 million pledge to fight desertification to accelerating the transition towards a decarbonised economy. But there was no headline promise likely to reassure poor nations on the sharp end of climate change that they will be better able to cope.

Public and private financial institutions pledged to channel more funds to spur the transition to a green economy and investors said they would pressure corporate giants to shift towards more ecologically friendly strategies.

Among the commitments, more than 200 institutional investors with $26 trillion in assets under management said on Tuesday they would step up pressure on the world's biggest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to combat climate change [nL8N1OB2K8].

That, they said, would be more effective than threatening to pull the plug on their investments in companies, which include Coal India , Gazprom , Exxon Mobil and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp <600028.SS>.

The European Commission, meanwhile, said it was "looking positively" at plans to reduce capital requirements for environmentally-friendly investments by banks in a bid to boost the green economy [nL8N1OC1HC].

"LITTLE FOR THE VULNERABLE"

Climate change is causing more frequent and severe flooding, droughts, storms and heatwaves as average global temperatures rise to new records, sea ice melts in the Arctic and sea levels rise.

Developing nations say the rich are lagging with a commitment dating back to 2009 to provide $100 billion a year by 2020 - from public and private sources alike - to help them switch from fossil fuels to greener energy sources and adapt to the effects of climate change.

On Tuesday, the European Commission announced 9 billion euros worth of investments targeting sustainable cities, sustainable energy and sustainable agriculture for Africa and EU neighbourhood countries.

Yet the United Nations Environment Programme says the cost of adapting to climate change in developing countries could rise to between $280 billion and $500 billion per year by 2050.

"Despite the hype, the One Planet summit is delivering little for the world's people who are the most vulnerable to climate change," said Brandon Wu, director of policy and campaigns at ActionAid USA.

"Rich countries continue to pretend that new schemes for businessmen to increase their profits will be the center of the solution for the poor."

Macron used the eve of the summit to award 18 grants to foreign climate scientists, most of whom are currently U.S.-based, to come and work in France [nL8N1OB5JE].

Big investors press major companies to step up climate action - 路透新闻

{{20171212T080101.425+0000}}Big investors press major companies to step up climate actionBy Alister Doyle

OSLO, Dec 12 (Reuters) - More than 200 institutional investors with $26 trillion in assets under management said on Tuesday they would step up pressure on the world's biggest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to combat climate change.

Two years to the day since 195 governments adopted the Paris climate agreement, investors including Pacific Investment Management Co, Amundi, Legal & General Investment Management, Northern Trust and Aegon said they aimed to work with the 100 biggest polluting companies to curb emissions under a five-year plan.

That, they said, would be more effective than threatening to pull the plug on their investments in such companies, which include Coal India , Gazprom , Exxon Mobil and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp <600028.SS>.

"We will be asking companies ... to curb emissions and bring them down in line with the Paris goals," said Anne Simpson, investment director of sustainability at the California Public Employees' Retirement System.

That would mean roughly an 80 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, she told reporters on a teleconference, beyond the ambition of most companies.

The investors said they were also calling on companies to improve disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions, including those from the use of their products, and to step up governance of climate risks and opportunities.

Under the investors' plan, divestment would only be a last resort. If big emitters refuse to cooperate with them, shareholders could ratchet up pressure with public statements, resolutions and votes.

Such measures can work, they said. In May, for instance, 62 percent of shareholders in Exxon Mobil voted for greater transparency about climate risks of oil and gas despite opposition from the board. [nL1N1IX15V]

"To talk about this as 'if you don't do what we want we're selling' in a way lets the companies off the hook," said Stephanie Maier, director of responsible investment at HSBC Global Asset Management.

She said it was better to cooperate with major emitters because they contributed to droughts, mudslides, heatwaves and rising sea levels that threatened investors' other holdings.

In the past, some big investors have divested from high polluting coal or from companies they judge to be out of line with the Paris agreement's goals.

Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change which is among those coordinating the five-year plan, said investors were increasingly looking for ways to align their portfolios with the Paris goals.

"We're two years on from Paris – this is a way to showcase there is momentum," she told Reuters.

Among pension funds with strong green goals, for instance, Denmark's $40 billion PKA aims to raise climate-related investments such as in wind turbines and green bonds to 10 percent of its holdings by 2020 from almost seven now.

Developing nations say the rich are lagging with a commitment dating back to 2009 to provide $100 billion a year by 2020 - from public and private sources alike - to help them switch from fossil fuels to greener energy sources and adapt to the effects of climate change.

On Tuesday, the European Commission announced 9 billion euros worth of investments targeting sustainable cities, sustainable energy and sustainable agriculture for Africa and EU neighbourhood countries.

Yet the United Nations Environment Programme says the cost of adapting to climate change in developing countries could rise to between $280 billion and $500 billion per year by 2050.

"Despite the hype, the One Planet summit is delivering little for the world's people who are the most vulnerable to climate change," said Brandon Wu, director of policy and campaigns at ActionAid USA.

"Rich countries continue to pretend that new schemes for businessmen to increase their profits will be the center of the solution for the poor."

JAKARTA, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Indonesia's Pertamina [PERTM.UL] expects to import up to 250,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in 2018, the head of the state-owned company's procurement unit said on Tuesday.

From Indonesia's crude output of around 800,000 bpd, about 500,000 bpd currently goes to Pertamina's domestic refineries, Toto Nugroho, Senior Vice President of the firm's Integrated Supply Chain unit, told reporters.

"Around 250,000 (bpd) is imported," he said, noting that this level would continue in 2018, with imports meeting some 40 percent of Indonesia's crude oil needs.

Pertamina's existing overseas crude processing deal with Sinopec <600028.SS> subsidiary Unipec is due to expire at the end of this month, Nugroho said. Pertamina is waiting for certainty on crude output cuts by OPEC member Iraq, from which it takes a share of Basra crude, before making a new deal, he added. [nJ9N1HB01F]

"How far they will cut, we don't know yet," Nugroho said, adding that there was a possibility Pertamina would sign a new crude processing deal in the second half of 2018.

Pertamina's gasoline imports are expected to be at around 9 million barrels per month in 2018, Nugroho said, roughly half of which would be RON88 gasoline and half RON92 gasoline.

The company is expecting to import around 6.8 million tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in 2018, Nugroho said.

Pertamina jet fuel imports are expected to climb to around 1 million barrels per month in 2018 from around 800,000 barrels per month this year "because our demand is good from the aviation sector", Nugroho said.

Pertamina hopes to supply around 90 percent of its import needs through term contracts, with the rest through spot market deals, Nugroho said.

"We only buy products on the spot market if there's an emergency," he said.

Bears and bulls lock horns over China's blue chips - 路透新闻

{{20171212T060002.709+0000}}Bears and bulls lock horns over China's blue chipsBy Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch

SHANGHAI, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Kweichow Moutai, the Chinese drinkmaker made famous when Richard Nixon drank its fiery sorghum liquor on his historic state visit to Beijing in 1972, has been the toast of the mainland's blue chip stock rally, surging 93 percent this year.

The stock's eye-popping rise prompted an editorial last month by Xinhua news agency, a government mouthpiece, that singled out Moutai as an example of a major stock vulnerable to value-destructive speculation.

While even the drinkmaker agreed its rally was too hot, the pointed warnings had limited market impact, knocking barely 10 percent off the stock's gains for the year, with the rally resuming as investors scooped up what they saw as a bargain.

And despite words of caution about a stock bubble from official channels and some market participants, other institutional investors argue a wider blue chip rally could last well into next year as China's investor base widens.

"Moutai's current valuation is not a deviation from fundamentals," said Jacqueline Zhang, Emerging Markets Equity analyst at U.S.-based investment manager OppenheimerFunds, whose China fund remains one of Kweichow Moutai Co Ltd's <600519.SS> top 10 shareholders.

"No doubt, Moutai is the most profitable liquor company in the world. The uniqueness of its assets merits the premium."

Although OppenheimerFunds slashed nearly one-fifth of its holdings in the firm last quarter as its stock price hit levels double that at the beginning of the year, it maintains that Moutai is not overpriced.

More broadly, the blue-chip index <.CSI300> is up about 22 percent this year, though it's been a bumpy ride higher.

The SSE50 <.SSE50>, which investors have dubbed China's Nifty 50 index, has far outperformed the broader stock market <.SSEC> this year, but posted its worst weekly loss in almost 12 months in the last week of November. Index heavyweights including Moutai, insurance giant Ping An <601318.SS> and automaker SAIC Motor saw heavy selling.

Several large investment firms concur that while prices of some large Chinese firms are in bubble-like territory, fresh investment flows from foreign funds looking to partake in China's rapid growth will push share prices even higher.

Shi Bin, the head of China equities at UBS Asset Management in Hong Kong, said this year's sharp rise in blue chips reflects a normalization of previously depressed valuations.

He expects China's inclusion next year into global index provider MSCI's benchmarks will channel more money into China's large-cap stocks, pushing prices higher.

Dutch firm NN Investment Partners has stayed put through the volatility, having picked Chinese businesses it believes have strong underlying fundamentals.

"Some investors are taking profits, especially where the valuations are quite full," said Ashish Goyal, NNIP's head of emerging markets equity. "But many of these companies are still great businesses and will continue to do well operationally."

Shane Oliver, the Sydney-based head of investment strategy at AMP Capital, which invests in Chinese securities and operates a mutual fund venture with China Life, believes a cash rotation out of blue-chips and into the broader market is due, given the higher return on equity for Chinese small- to mid-cap firms.

TROUBLE BREWING

Moutai's stock had surged as much as 115 percent until Nov. 16, when the company itself warned investors the price rise had been too rapid. The selloff that ensued wiped out 110 billion yuan of market value from Moutai's peak. [nL3N1NN1B1]

Even after the recent correction, Moutai trades at more than 30-times earnings compared with just around 13 times two years ago. It commands a market capitalization exceeding 800 billion yuan ($120.98 billion), dwarfing oil giant Sinopec <600028.SS>, and top insurer China Life <601628.SS>.

Gu Weiyong, the chief investment officer at Shanghai-based money manager Ucom Investment, said a rise in borrowing costs following Beijing's crackdown on shadow banking is likely to make sectors valued at 30-50-times earnings seem too expensive.

Like OppenheimerFunds, state-backed China Securities Finance Corp and Singapore's state investment firm GIC have pared their Moutai holdings, exchange filings show, while others, such as UBS, have no plans yet to reduce their stakes, citing longer-term gains.

For the bears, however, a continuation of the exuberance into next year will only lead to more pain.

"The blue-chip bubble may be inflated bigger in 2018, before bursting," said Sun Zheng, strategist at China Development Bank Securities.

Venezuela's PDVSA settles lawsuit with China's Sinopec - 路透新闻

{{20171212T210729.462+0000}}Venezuela's PDVSA settles lawsuit with China's SinopecDec 12 (Reuters) - Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA has agreed to pay a subsidiary of its Chinese counterpart Sinopec <600028.SS> $21.5 million owed for a 2012 steel rebar order, quickly settling a Nov. 27 lawsuit, according to court papers.

China has been one of Venezuela's biggest financial backers, lending it more than $50 billion over the past decade. Its lawsuit against PDVSA, claiming breach of contract and conspiracy to defraud, was interpreted by experts as a sign that the Chinese powerhouse was losing patience with the cash-strapped government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. [nL1N1O70EU]

Under the settlement in U.S. District Court in Houston on Monday and seen on Tuesday, PDVSA agreed to pay Sinopec USA the remaining half of a $43.5 million purchase order in two instalments, one on Dec. 14 and the other on Jan. 15, 2018.

Even in the context of delayed debt payments by Venezuela, Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez of Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management said "when you think about the cash flow at PDVSA, it's not a difficult sum to pay."

The amount, which does not include an additional $2.2 million Sinopec had requested to cover litigation and administrative costs, will be paid in Chinese renminbi.

In the agreement, PDVSA said the payment does not imply "acknowledgment of fault or responsibility" but was for the sole purpose of ending the controversy between the two parties.

Sinopec told the court it was dismissing the claims against PDVSA following the settlement.

{{20171212T180457.587+0000}}UPDATE 4-World is losing the battle against climate change, Macron says* Summit takes place on 2-year anniversary of Paris climate deal

* Macron gives bleak assessment says: "We all need to act"

* Trump has said he plans to take U.S. out of Paris agreement

* Investors say will put more pressure on global companies

(Adds ActionAid USA, details on commitments)

By Richard Lough and Michel Rose

PARIS, Dec 12 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron delivered a bleak assessment on the global fight against climate change to dozens of world leaders and company executives on Tuesday, telling them: "We are losing the battle".

"We're not moving quickly enough. We all need to act," Macron said, seeking to breathe new life into a collective effort that was weakened this summer when President Donald Trump said he was pulling the United States out of an international accord brokered in the French capital two years ago.

Macron, who has worked to establish his role as a global leader since his sweeping election win in May, said modern-day science was revealing with each day the danger that global warming posed to the planet, he said.

"We are losing the battle," he said, urging a new phase in the fight against global warming.

France announced a raft of 12 non-binding commitments, from a $300 million pledge to fight desertification to accelerating the transition towards a decarbonised economy. But there was no headline promise likely to reassure poor nations on the sharp end of climate change that they will be better able to cope.

Public and private financial institutions pledged to channel more funds to spur the transition to a green economy and investors said they would pressure corporate giants to shift towards more ecologically friendly strategies.

Among the commitments, more than 200 institutional investors with $26 trillion in assets under management said on Tuesday they would step up pressure on the world's biggest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to combat climate change [nL8N1OB2K8].

That, they said, would be more effective than threatening to pull the plug on their investments in companies, which include Coal India , Gazprom , Exxon Mobil and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp <600028.SS>.

The European Commission, meanwhile, said it was "looking positively" at plans to reduce capital requirements for environmentally-friendly investments by banks in a bid to boost the green economy [nL8N1OC1HC].

"LITTLE FOR THE VULNERABLE"

Climate change is causing more frequent and severe flooding, droughts, storms and heatwaves as average global temperatures rise to new records, sea ice melts in the Arctic and sea levels rise.

Developing nations say the rich are lagging with a commitment dating back to 2009 to provide $100 billion a year by 2020 - from public and private sources alike - to help them switch from fossil fuels to greener energy sources and adapt to the effects of climate change.

On Tuesday, the European Commission announced 9 billion euros worth of investments targeting sustainable cities, sustainable energy and sustainable agriculture for Africa and EU neighbourhood countries.

Yet the United Nations Environment Programme says the cost of adapting to climate change in developing countries could rise to between $280 billion and $500 billion per year by 2050.

"Despite the hype, the One Planet summit is delivering little for the world's people who are the most vulnerable to climate change," said Brandon Wu, director of policy and campaigns at ActionAid USA.

"Rich countries continue to pretend that new schemes for businessmen to increase their profits will be the center of the solution for the poor."

Tencent leads Hang Seng lower ahead of likely U.S. rate hike - 路透新闻

{{20171212T083443.615+0000}}Tencent leads Hang Seng lower ahead of likely U.S. rate hikeDec 12 (Reuters) - Hong Kong stocks dropped on Tuesday, as index heavyweight Tencent <0700.HK> slumped over 3 percent, and declines in other technology shares also weighed on sentiment.

Investors are wary about higher borrowing costs ahead, with the U.S. Federal Reserve widely expected to raise interest rates this week. The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar and interest rates there tend to move in tandem with those in the United States.

** At close of trade, the Hang Seng index was down 171.41 points or 0.59 percent at 28,793.88. The Hang Seng China Enterprises index <.HSCE> fell 1.04 percent to 11,312.57. **The sub-index of the Hang Seng tracking energy shares <.HSCIE> rose 1.3 percent while the IT sector <.HSCIIT> slumped 2.75 percent, the financial sector <.HSNF> was 0.41 percent lower and the property sector rose 0.16 percent. ** The top gainer on the Hang Seng was CNOOC Ltd <0883.HK> up 3.4 percent, while the biggest loser was Sunny Optical Technology Group Co Ltd <2382.HK> which was down 7.39 percent. ** China's main Shanghai Composite index <.SSEC> closed down 1.24 percent at 3,281.0104 points while its blue-chip CSI300 index <.CSI300> ended down 1.32 percent. ** Around the region, MSCI's Asia ex-Japan stock index <.MIAPJ0000PUS> was weaker by 0.33 percent while Japan's Nikkei index <.N225> closed down 0.32 percent . ** The yuan was quoted at 6.6216 per U.S. dollar at 08:12 GMT, 0.05 percent weaker than the previous close of 6.6185. ** So far this year, the Hang Seng index is up 31.66 percent, while China's H-share index is up 21.7 percent. As of the previous close, the Hang Seng has declined 0.73 percent this month. ** The top gainers among H-shares were PetroChina Co Ltd <0857.HK> up 1.17 percent, followed by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd <1398.HK> gaining 1.01 percent and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp <0386.HK> up by percent. ** The three biggest H-share percentage decliners were New China Life Insurance Co Ltd <1336.HK> which was down 3.33 percent, China Galaxy Securities Co Ltd <6881.HK> which fell 3.1 percent and Anhui Conch Cement Co Ltd <0914.HK> down by 3.1 percent. ** About 2.20 billion Hang Seng index shares were traded, roughly 110.2 percent of the market's 30-day moving average of 2.00 billion shares a day.

Big investors press major companies to step up climate action - 路透新闻

{{20171212T080101.425+0000}}Big investors press major companies to step up climate actionBy Alister Doyle

OSLO, Dec 12 (Reuters) - More than 200 institutional investors with $26 trillion in assets under management said on Tuesday they would step up pressure on the world's biggest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to combat climate change.

Two years to the day since 195 governments adopted the Paris climate agreement, investors including Pacific Investment Management Co, Amundi, Legal & General Investment Management, Northern Trust and Aegon said they aimed to work with the 100 biggest polluting companies to curb emissions under a five-year plan.

That, they said, would be more effective than threatening to pull the plug on their investments in such companies, which include Coal India , Gazprom , Exxon Mobil and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp <600028.SS>.

"We will be asking companies ... to curb emissions and bring them down in line with the Paris goals," said Anne Simpson, investment director of sustainability at the California Public Employees' Retirement System.

That would mean roughly an 80 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, she told reporters on a teleconference, beyond the ambition of most companies.

The investors said they were also calling on companies to improve disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions, including those from the use of their products, and to step up governance of climate risks and opportunities.

French President Emmanuel Macron will hold a summit in Paris on Tuesday to build on the 2015 climate accord, which has been weakened by President Donald Trump's plan to pull the United States out and instead bolster the U.S. fossil fuel industry. [nL8N1O75Z7] [nL1N1IZ1BA]

Under the investors' plan, divestment would only be a last resort. If big emitters refuse to cooperate with them, shareholders could ratchet up pressure with public statements, resolutions and votes.

Such measures can work, they said. In May, for instance, 62 percent of shareholders in Exxon Mobil voted for greater transparency about climate risks of oil and gas despite opposition from the board. [nL1N1IX15V]

"To talk about this as 'if you don't do what we want we're selling' in a way lets the companies off the hook," said Stephanie Maier, director of responsible investment at HSBC Global Asset Management.

She said it was better to cooperate with major emitters because they contributed to droughts, mudslides, heatwaves and rising sea levels that threatened investors' other holdings.

In the past, some big investors have divested from high polluting coal or from companies they judge to be out of line with the Paris agreement's goals.

Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change which is among those coordinating the five-year plan, said investors were increasingly looking for ways to align their portfolios with the Paris goals.

"We're two years on from Paris – this is a way to showcase there is momentum," she told Reuters.

Among pension funds with strong green goals, for instance, Denmark's $40 billion PKA aims to raise climate-related investments such as in wind turbines and green bonds to 10 percent of its holdings by 2020 from almost seven now.

Big investors press major companies to step up climate action - 路透新闻

{{20171212T080100.000+0000}}Big investors press major companies to step up climate actionOSLO, Dec 12 (Reuters)

By Alister Doyle

OSLO, Dec 12 (Reuters) - More than 200 institutional investors with $26 trillion in assets under management said on Tuesday they would step up pressure on the world's biggest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to combat climate change.

Two years to the day since 195 governments adopted the Paris climate agreement, investors including Pacific Investment Management Co, Amundi, Legal & General Investment Management, Northern Trust and Aegon said they aimed to work with the 100 biggest polluting companies to curb emissions under a five-year plan.

That, they said, would be more effective than threatening to pull the plug on their investments in such companies, which include Coal India , Gazprom , Exxon Mobil and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp <600028.SS>.

"We will be asking companies ... to curb emissions and bring them down in line with the Paris goals," said Anne Simpson, investment director of sustainability at the California Public Employees' Retirement System.

That would mean roughly an 80 percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, she told reporters on a teleconference, beyond the ambition of most companies.

The investors said they were also calling on companies to improve disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions, including those from the use of their products, and to step up governance of climate risks and opportunities.

French President Emmanuel Macron will hold a summit in Paris on Tuesday to build on the 2015 climate accord, which has been weakened by President Donald Trump's plan to pull the United States out and instead bolster the U.S. fossil fuel industry. [nL8N1O75Z7] [nL1N1IZ1BA]

Under the investors' plan, divestment would only be a last resort. If big emitters refuse to cooperate with them, shareholders could ratchet up pressure with public statements, resolutions and votes.

Such measures can work, they said. In May, for instance, 62 percent of shareholders in Exxon Mobil voted for greater transparency about climate risks of oil and gas despite opposition from the board. [nL1N1IX15V]

"To talk about this as 'if you don't do what we want we're selling' in a way lets the companies off the hook," said Stephanie Maier, director of responsible investment at HSBC Global Asset Management.

She said it was better to cooperate with major emitters because they contributed to droughts, mudslides, heatwaves and rising sea levels that threatened investors' other holdings.

In the past, some big investors have divested from high polluting coal or from companies they judge to be out of line with the Paris agreement's goals.

Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change which is among those coordinating the five-year plan, said investors were increasingly looking for ways to align their portfolios with the Paris goals.

"We're two years on from Paris – this is a way to showcase there is momentum," she told Reuters.

* Summit takes place on 2-year anniversary of Paris climate deal

* Macron gives bleak assessment says: "We all need to act"

* Trump has said he plans to take U.S. out of Paris agreement

* Investors say will put more pressure on global companies

(Adds ActionAid USA, details on commitments)

By Richard Lough and Michel Rose

PARIS, Dec 12 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron delivered a bleak assessment on the global fight against climate change to dozens of world leaders and company executives on Tuesday, telling them: "We are losing the battle".

"We're not moving quickly enough. We all need to act," Macron said, seeking to breathe new life into a collective effort that was weakened this summer when President Donald Trump said he was pulling the United States out of an international accord brokered in the French capital two years ago.

Macron, who has worked to establish his role as a global leader since his sweeping election win in May, said modern-day science was revealing with each day the danger that global warming posed to the planet, he said.

"We are losing the battle," he said, urging a new phase in the fight against global warming.

France announced a raft of 12 non-binding commitments, from a $300 million pledge to fight desertification to accelerating the transition towards a decarbonised economy. But there was no headline promise likely to reassure poor nations on the sharp end of climate change that they will be better able to cope.

Public and private financial institutions pledged to channel more funds to spur the transition to a green economy and investors said they would pressure corporate giants to shift towards more ecologically friendly strategies.

Among the commitments, more than 200 institutional investors with $26 trillion in assets under management said on Tuesday they would step up pressure on the world's biggest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to combat climate change [nL8N1OB2K8].

That, they said, would be more effective than threatening to pull the plug on their investments in companies, which include Coal India , Gazprom , Exxon Mobil and China Petroleum & Chemical Corp <600028.SS>.

The European Commission, meanwhile, said it was "looking positively" at plans to reduce capital requirements for environmentally-friendly investments by banks in a bid to boost the green economy [nL8N1OC1HC].

"LITTLE FOR THE VULNERABLE"

Climate change is causing more frequent and severe flooding, droughts, storms and heatwaves as average global temperatures rise to new records, sea ice melts in the Arctic and sea levels rise.

Developing nations say the rich are lagging with a commitment dating back to 2009 to provide $100 billion a year by 2020 - from public and private sources alike - to help them switch from fossil fuels to greener energy sources and adapt to the effects of climate change.

On Tuesday, the European Commission announced 9 billion euros worth of investments targeting sustainable cities, sustainable energy and sustainable agriculture for Africa and EU neighbourhood countries.

Yet the United Nations Environment Programme says the cost of adapting to climate change in developing countries could rise to between $280 billion and $500 billion per year by 2050.

"Despite the hype, the One Planet summit is delivering little for the world's people who are the most vulnerable to climate change," said Brandon Wu, director of policy and campaigns at ActionAid USA.

"Rich countries continue to pretend that new schemes for businessmen to increase their profits will be the center of the solution for the poor."

Macron used the eve of the summit to award 18 grants to foreign climate scientists, most of whom are currently U.S.-based, to come and work in France [nL8N1OB5JE].

* Sees Jet fuel imports climbing 25 pct in 2018

* To purchase around 10 pct of overall imports in spot mkt

(Adds comment, background)

By Wilda Asmarini

JAKARTA, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Indonesia's Pertamina [PERTM.UL] expects to import up to 250,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in 2018, the head of the state-owned company's procurement unit said on Tuesday.

From Indonesia's crude output of around 800,000 bpd, about 500,000 bpd currently goes to Pertamina's domestic refineries, Toto Nugroho, Senior Vice President of the firm's Integrated Supply Chain unit, told reporters.

"Around 250,000 (bpd) is imported," he said, noting that this level would continue in 2018, with imports meeting some 40 percent of Indonesia's crude oil needs.

Pertamina's existing overseas crude processing deal with Sinopec <600028.SS> subsidiary Unipec is due to expire at the end of this month, Nugroho said. Pertamina is waiting for certainty on crude output cuts by OPEC member Iraq, from which it takes a share of Basra crude, before making a new deal, he added. [nJ9N1HB01F]

"How far they will cut, we don't know yet," Nugroho said, adding that there was a possibility Pertamina would sign a new crude processing deal in the second half of 2018.

Pertamina's gasoline imports are expected to be at around 9 million barrels per month in 2018, Nugroho said, roughly half of which would be RON88 gasoline and half RON92 gasoline.

The company is expecting to import around 6.8 million tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in 2018, Nugroho said.

Pertamina jet fuel imports are expected to climb to around 1 million barrels per month in 2018 from around 800,000 barrels per month this year "because our demand is good from the aviation sector", Nugroho said.

Pertamina hopes to supply around 90 percent of its import needs through term contracts, with the rest through spot market deals, Nugroho said.

"We only buy products on the spot market if there's an emergency," he said.

Bears and bulls lock horns over China's blue chips - 路透新闻

{{20171212T060002.709+0000}}Bears and bulls lock horns over China's blue chipsBy Samuel Shen and John Ruwitch

SHANGHAI, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Kweichow Moutai, the Chinese drinkmaker made famous when Richard Nixon drank its fiery sorghum liquor on his historic state visit to Beijing in 1972, has been the toast of the mainland's blue chip stock rally, surging 93 percent this year.

The stock's eye-popping rise prompted an editorial last month by Xinhua news agency, a government mouthpiece, that singled out Moutai as an example of a major stock vulnerable to value-destructive speculation.

While even the drinkmaker agreed its rally was too hot, the pointed warnings had limited market impact, knocking barely 10 percent off the stock's gains for the year, with the rally resuming as investors scooped up what they saw as a bargain.

And despite words of caution about a stock bubble from official channels and some market participants, other institutional investors argue a wider blue chip rally could last well into next year as China's investor base widens.

"Moutai's current valuation is not a deviation from fundamentals," said Jacqueline Zhang, Emerging Markets Equity analyst at U.S.-based investment manager OppenheimerFunds, whose China fund remains one of Kweichow Moutai Co Ltd's <600519.SS> top 10 shareholders.

"No doubt, Moutai is the most profitable liquor company in the world. The uniqueness of its assets merits the premium."

Although OppenheimerFunds slashed nearly one-fifth of its holdings in the firm last quarter as its stock price hit levels double that at the beginning of the year, it maintains that Moutai is not overpriced.

More broadly, the blue-chip index <.CSI300> is up about 22 percent this year, though it's been a bumpy ride higher.

The SSE50 <.SSE50>, which investors have dubbed China's Nifty 50 index, has far outperformed the broader stock market <.SSEC> this year, but posted its worst weekly loss in almost 12 months in the last week of November. Index heavyweights including Moutai, insurance giant Ping An <601318.SS> and automaker SAIC Motor saw heavy selling.

Several large investment firms concur that while prices of some large Chinese firms are in bubble-like territory, fresh investment flows from foreign funds looking to partake in China's rapid growth will push share prices even higher.

Shi Bin, the head of China equities at UBS Asset Management in Hong Kong, said this year's sharp rise in blue chips reflects a normalization of previously depressed valuations.

He expects China's inclusion next year into global index provider MSCI's benchmarks will channel more money into China's large-cap stocks, pushing prices higher.

Dutch firm NN Investment Partners has stayed put through the volatility, having picked Chinese businesses it believes have strong underlying fundamentals.

"Some investors are taking profits, especially where the valuations are quite full," said Ashish Goyal, NNIP's head of emerging markets equity. "But many of these companies are still great businesses and will continue to do well operationally."

Shane Oliver, the Sydney-based head of investment strategy at AMP Capital, which invests in Chinese securities and operates a mutual fund venture with China Life, believes a cash rotation out of blue-chips and into the broader market is due, given the higher return on equity for Chinese small- to mid-cap firms.

TROUBLE BREWING

Moutai's stock had surged as much as 115 percent until Nov. 16, when the company itself warned investors the price rise had been too rapid. The selloff that ensued wiped out 110 billion yuan of market value from Moutai's peak. [nL3N1NN1B1]

Even after the recent correction, Moutai trades at more than 30-times earnings compared with just around 13 times two years ago. It commands a market capitalization exceeding 800 billion yuan ($120.98 billion), dwarfing oil giant Sinopec <600028.SS>, and top insurer China Life <601628.SS>.

Gu Weiyong, the chief investment officer at Shanghai-based money manager Ucom Investment, said a rise in borrowing costs following Beijing's crackdown on shadow banking is likely to make sectors valued at 30-50-times earnings seem too expensive.

Like OppenheimerFunds, state-backed China Securities Finance Corp and Singapore's state investment firm GIC have pared their Moutai holdings, exchange filings show, while others, such as UBS, have no plans yet to reduce their stakes, citing longer-term gains.

For the bears, however, a continuation of the exuberance into next year will only lead to more pain.

"The blue-chip bubble may be inflated bigger in 2018, before bursting," said Sun Zheng, strategist at China Development Bank Securities.

Asia Tankers-VLCC rates to remain under pressure, U.S. trade to grow - 路透新闻

{{20171201T082628.072+0000}}Asia Tankers-VLCC rates to remain under pressure, U.S. trade to grow* MidEast rates fall below break-even levels

* Oil producers pact will mean more long-haul U.S. volumes -Frontline

* Currently about 25-30 U.S.-Caribbean cargoes are shipped a month - brokers

By Keith Wallis

SINGAPORE, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Charter rates for very large crude carriers (VLCCs), which fell below break-even levels on routes from the Middle East this week, are expected to remain under pressure as too many ships chase too few cargoes, brokers said.

"This is the worst in terms of earnings sentiment for winter. Wake me up when December ends," said a Singapore-based supertanker broker on Friday.

That came as major oil producers agreed on Thursday to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018 in a move that is expected to open the market to increased crude volumes from the United States and other exporters. [nL8N1O01I9]

Increased exports from the United States could potentially support VLCC rates because longer voyage distances to Asia would cut the number of vessels available for charter.

"The effect (of the output cuts) we have found neutral as the reduction in Middle East export volumes was replaced by increased volumes from Atlantic Basin," said Robert Hvide Macleod, chief executive of leading tanker owner Frontline Management.

Macleod told Reuters that as a result of the continued cap "we believe the 'new trades' will develop further - long-term positive for shipping".

Unipec, the trading arm of Asia's largest oil refiner Sinopec <600028.SS>, signalled last week its intention to double the volume of U.S. oil it will import next year from 6 million tonnes this year. [nL3N1NU1SB]

There are around 24-30 VLCC cargoes a month from the U.S.-Caribbean region, brokers said.

"With crude from the Caribbean-U.S. Gulf area being heavy sour crude it will only find a home - China and India - which have the refineries that can process them," said Ashok Sharma, managing director of Singapore shipbroker BRS Baxi Far East.

"There is not going to be an instant reflex in the tanker markets to the oil producers' decision on Thursday. But shale oil producers will increase production," Sharma said.

Brokers estimated there were an average of around 15 fewer VLCC cargoes per month from the Middle East since the cuts were implemented in January.

That, together with the delivery of around 52 new VLCCs this year, has increased the number of ships available for charter, putting pressure on freight rates.

Supertanker earnings for a voyage from the Middle East to Japan dropped to around $18,200 per day on Thursday, compared with $32,600 per day at the fourth quarter peak on Oct. 17, data on the Reuters Eikon terminal showed.

That compared with daily break-even costs of $20,000-$22,000, brokers said.

"Rates of under $20,000 a day for December loading have not been seen for a long time," Sharma added.

VLCC rates on the Middle East-to-Japan route <.BAGJ> dropped to 56.50 on the Worldscale measure on Thursday, the lowest since Sept. 29, from W63.50 last week.

Rates on the West Africa-to-China route <.BAWC> fell to around W64 on Thursday, against W66.50 the same day last week.

Charter rates for an 80,000-deadweight-tonne Aframax tanker from Southeast Asia to East Coast Australia <.BAIJ> slipped to W109.25 on Thursday from W112.50 last week.

China stocks fall after soft factory growth; HK little changed - 路透新闻

{{20171201T041828.391+0000}}China stocks fall after soft factory growth; HK little changedSHANGHAI, Dec 1 (Reuters) - China stocks fell on Friday morning, after a private survey showed the country's manufacturing activity grew at the weakest pace in five months in November as input costs remained high and tougher pollution measures weighed on business confidence.
