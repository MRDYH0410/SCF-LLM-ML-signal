UPDATE 2-Traders cancel light cycle oil cargoes ahead of China tax-sources - 路透新闻

{{20170406T094933.348+0000}}UPDATE 2-Traders cancel light cycle oil cargoes ahead of China tax-sources* China buyers cancel two late-April loading cargoes - sources

* A third cargo may also be cancelled soon - source

* Interest for May loading cargoes dwindles - refining source

(Adds analyst, Sinopec comment, teapot reaction)

By Jessica Jaganathan

SINGAPORE/BEIJING, April 6 (Reuters) - Traders in North Asia are rushing to cancel loadings of a range of oil products for sale to China, ahead of a planned Chinese consumption tax that will make the trade uneconomic.

At least two light cycle oil (LCO) cargoes have been cancelled for late April loading from South Korea ahead of the planned tax on the refinery by-product, two sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday. They declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak with the media.

The cargoes were purchased by Chinese companies who have in turn cancelled their requirement, one of the sources said, adding that another Chinese oil trader is trying to cancel a third cargo.

Interest for May-loading LCO cargoes has also disappeared, a Japanese refining source said.

A senior source with a Shandong-based independent refiner said his company has held off booking new cargoes beyond a 40,000-tonne parcel of mixed aromatics for late April arrival.

China plans to impose consumption taxes on oil by-products such as mixed aromatics, light cycle oil and bitumen blend, sources with knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday. The plan will likely squeeze the margins of the independent refiners. The combined imports of these products are estimated at 20 million tonnes a year. [nL3N1HD2JU]

The move will close a loophole that allowed Chinese buyers to import light cycle oil, then sell it locally as low-grade diesel, avoiding import taxes that would normally be levied on diesel.

"Demand for these products have in recent years been distorted because of exemptions from consumption tax," said Seng-Yick Tee, an analyst with consultancy SIA Energy.

A consumption tax of 1,400 yuan ($203) per tonne could be levied for LCO, the sources said on Wednesday, with traders expecting the tax in May or June.

The Chinese government has considered the taxes since 2012 but was more determined this time as imports of these products rose and ate into the market share of state-owned companies like Sinopec Corp <0386.HK>, said senior Beijing-based traders and oil company officials.

The tax advantages of LCO have led refiners to maximise production over other fuels, the two sources with knowledge of the South Korean cargoes said.

LCO was selling at a premium to Korea gasoil prices of about $6 a barrel on a free-on-board (FOB) Korea basis at its peak earlier this year, which in turn attracted cargoes from as far away as Europe, traders said.

The premium for LCO has since dropped to about $2 to $3 a barrel, but volumes of the fuel into China have soared.

Imports of LCO into China rose to as much as 600,000 tonnes a month by March from 350,000 tonnes a month last year, two traders familiar with the market said.

* Volumes slashed by 73 percent from first round - sources

* PetroChina not given quota in this trade category - sources

By Seng Li Peng and Jessica Jaganathan

SINGAPORE, April 5 (Reuters) - China has cut oil product export quotas to the nation's four
oil majors by 73 percent in the second batch of export quotas for 2017, two sources familiar
with the matter said on Wednesday.

The quota did not include PetroChina <601857.SS>, the sources said, which is unusual as
PetroChina is a major exporter of oil products. The reason was not immediately clear.

But this does not mean PetroChina will not be exporting oil products, a source said, adding
that PetroChina would continue to export under a different trade category.

Sinopec Corp <600028.SS>, CNOOC <0883.HK> and Sinochem Group <600500.SS> will be allowed to
sell an additional 3.335 million tonnes of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel this year, the sources
said.

The three oil majors together with PetroChina were given a quota of 12.4 million tonnes of
oil products to export in 2017 in the first round of quotas. [nL1N1EN07S]

China issued allowances for a record 46.08 million tonnes of oil products in 2016, up 80
percent from 2015. The world's second-largest oil consumer exported about 48.3 million tonnes of
refined oil products in 2016, up 34 percent from the previous year, customs data shows.
 [nEAP222684]

Traders had expected the second quota round to be higher than the first as regional fuel
demand for construction and transport usually picks up after the winter slowdown.

China usually releases three or four rounds of quotas a year.

ANALYSIS-Brazil's oil exports set to jump this year, weakening OPEC curbs - 路透新闻

{{20170331T174233.041+0000}}ANALYSIS-Brazil's oil exports set to jump this year, weakening OPEC curbsBy Marta Nogueira and Marcelo Teixeira

RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO, March 31 (Reuters) - Brazil is poised to sharply increase oil exports this year as heavy investments spur new output and demand for its lighter crudes win more buyers, especially in China and India.

Production is projected to rise 210,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2017, second only in the size of additional supply to the United States among non-OPEC producers. Higher output from the U.S. and Brazil are among the factors impeding an OPEC-led effort to lift crude prices through production cuts. [nL3N1H84F2]

Growth in exports should continue in future years as companies such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc prepare to tap some of the largest discoveries made since the end of the last decade off the nation's Atlantic coast.

Already just in the first two months of the year, Brazil's oil exports have soared 65 percent over the same period a year earlier to record highs of more than 1.46 million bpd, according to government data obtained by Reuters. [nL2N1GF1V8]

Consultancy Wood Mackenzie estimates 2017 exports will hit nearly 1 million bpd, up from 798,000 bpd last year.

Years of heavy investment that left state-controlled Petróleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) as the world's most indebted oil company are beginning to pay off. The nation hopes to use higher oil sales to help drag its economy out of a two-year recession.

Exports are rising along with the company's output of light, sweet crudes, Guilherme Franca, executive manager for marketing and trading at Petrobras told Reuters.

"Our production consists of much lighter oil than we used to produce in the past," he said in an interview.

"We have demand for more of it than we can deliver."

Light, low-sulfur crudes are easier and cheaper to refine into gasoline and diesel, and match demands for less polluting fuels in Asia, the United States and Europe.

Franca said exports by Petrobras alone rose to 420,000 bpd in 2016 and should reach 450,000 bpd this year. If it meets future targets, the company could be exporting as much as 750,000 bpd as soon as 2020, he said.

In the first two months this year, Brazil sold 10.4 million barrels of crude to India, half as much as it shipped to the country during 2016, Brazil's trade ministry data showed.

Sales to China in January and February totaled 40.8 million barrels, up 125 percent from the same period in 2016 and more than 10 times Brazil's shipments to the country five years ago.

Some of the oil shipments are linked to repayments on as much as $15 billion in loans from China, including debt taken on in 2009.

Under deals with lender China Development Bank, the oil giant would send as much as 300,000 bpd to four Chinese firms: China National United Oil Corporation, China Zhenhua Oil Co Ltd, Chemchina Petrochemical Co Ltd and Unipec Asia, a subsidiary of Sinopec Corp .[nL1N1EB0B8][nL2N1652DA]

"There is strong demand currently for Brazil's medium-sweet crude. The United States, China, Korea, India, they are all buyers of this type of oil due to newer standards to reduce sulfur content in fuels," said Esa Ramasamy, an analyst with S&P Global Platts.

Ramasamy said 65 percent of Brazil's output is medium-sweet grades and most of the country's new production will be of the same type.

Petrobras produced 2.14 million bpd in 2016 and targets 2.77 million bpd by 2021. The company, which is trying to reduce debt of around $100 billion, is pouring all its efforts into the high-yield subsalt region.

Shell, the second largest producer in Brazil after Petrobras, is pumping around 295,000 bpd and wants to quadruple that in three years. The company is part of a consortium that will explore the giant Libra subsalt prospect, along with Petrobras, France's Total SA and China's CNOOC Ltd <0883.HK> and China National Petroleum Corp <601857.SS>.

March shipping data shows PetroChina moving a 130,000-tonne tanker from Brazil to China. Commodity trader Vitol [VITOLV.UL] also has two tankers carrying 260,000 tonnes of Brazilian crude, and Shell and Repsol SA have 560,000 tonnes, also heading to China.

Wood Mackenzie analyst Ixchel Castro said exports also have been boosted by weaker domestic consumption from the country's deepest recession on record. An economic recovery could siphon some of the exports.

UPDATE 1-China steps up Americas oil imports, Unipec backs "new frontier" - 路透新闻

{{20170331T091208.300+0000}}UPDATE 1-China steps up Americas oil imports, Unipec backs "new frontier"* China buys record Americas oil imports in March - Reuters data

* Americas market share rises 1.1 pct points in Q1 to 14 pct

* Unipec urges Asian buyers to diversify from Mideast, Africa

* Seeks supply from new frontier - greater U.S. Gulf coast region

(Adds first Southern Green Canyon and Thunderhorse crude cargoes to arrive in China in April)

By Florence Tan

SINGAPORE, March 31 (Reuters) - China's largest crude oil buyer Sinopec aims to ship more cargoes from Brazil, the United States and Canada, to help ensure stable crude supplies as the Middle East boosts refining capacity and Africa suffers disruptions.

Shipments from the Americas hit an all-time high in March, boosting the region's share of the Chinese market by 1.1 percentage points in the first quarter to close to 14 percent, data from Thomson Reuters Oil Research & Forecasts showed.

"We're facing a big challenge on the supply side," said Chen Bo, president at Unipec, which purchases crude for Asia's largest refiner Sinopec <0386.HK><600028.SS>.

Asia needed to step up crude imports from the "new frontier", the greater U.S. Gulf Coast region made up of the United States, Canada and Latin America, to meet its growing demand, he told a seminar this week.

China is on track to overtake the United States as the world's largest oil consumer this year, Chen added.

China will add just under 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity between 2016 and 2020, taking its total capacity to nearly 12.5 million bpd by the end of this decade.

Also, by end-2018, the total crude import quota for independent refineries will grow to 2 million bpd, about 500,000 bpd more than March 2017 as government approvals flow through, he said.

SUPPLY DIVERSITY

Asia, which will account for a third of the world's refining capacity by 2020, will have to look beyond traditional markets Middle East and Africa for crude supplies, Chen said.

Security of supply and the optimization of supply were vital for Unipec.

"If every consumer goes to the Middle East and Africa we don't know what will happen to the market. So we have to diversify," he said.

China's crude imports from the Americas, led by Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia, hit 5.61 million tonnes (1.3 million bpd) in March, the highest in Reuters' data going back to 2006.

In the same month, China's crude oil deficit came in at a hefty 15 million tonnes, after touching a record 19 million in December 2016, as domestic production shrank while imports surged, customs data showed.

"Record imports are being driven by falling production, higher refinery runs, huge infrastructure and Strategic Petroleum Reserve builds," said Virendra Chauhan of consultancy Energy Aspects. The agency expects Asia's crude imports, led by China, to rise by 900,000 bpd on the year in 2017.

A preference for low-sulphur oil produced in the Americas by China's private refineries, or so-called "teapots", helped boost imports from the region, while increasing U.S. shale output and production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have made it economical for traders to send huge volumes of crude from west to east.

China steps up Americas oil imports, Unipec backs "new frontier" - 路透新闻

{{20170331T064446.499+0000}}China steps up Americas oil imports, Unipec backs "new frontier"* China buys record Americas oil imports in March - Reuters data

* Americas market share rises 1.1 pct points in Q1 to 14 pct

* Unipec urges Asian buyers to diversify from Mideast, Africa

* Seeks supply from new frontier - greater U.S. Gulf coast region

By Florence Tan

SINGAPORE, March 31 (Reuters) - China's largest crude oil buyer Sinopec aims to ship more cargoes from Brazil, the United States and Canada, to help ensure stable crude supplies as the Middle East boost refining capacity and Africa suffers disruptions.

Shipments from the Americas hit an all-time high in March, boosting the region's share of the Chinese market by 1.1 percentage points in the first quarter to close to 14 percent, data from Thomson Reuters Oil Research & Forecasts showed.

"We're facing a big challenge on the supply side," said Chen Bo, president at Unipec, which purchases crude for Asia's largest refiner Sinopec <0386.HK><600028.SS>.

Asia needed to step up crude imports from the "new frontier", the greater U.S. Gulf Coast region made up of the United States, Canada and Latin America, to meet its growing demand, he told a seminar this week.

Chen said China, the world's second largest oil consumer behind the United States, is on track to become the largest crude importer this year ahead of the United States.

China will add just under 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of refining capacity between 2016 and 2020, taking its total capacity to nearly 12.5 million bpd by the end of this decade.

Also, by end-2018, the total crude import quota for independent refineries will grow to 2 million bpd, about 500,000 bpd more from March 2017 as government approvals flow through, he said.

SUPPLY DIVERSITY

Asia, which will account for a third of the world's refining capacity by 2020, will have to look beyond traditional markets Middle East and Africa for crude supplies, Chen said.

Security of supply and the optimization of supply were vital for Unipec.

"If every consumer goes to the Middle East and Africa we don't know what will happen to the market. So we have to diversify," he said.

China's crude imports from the Americas, led by Brazil, Venezuela and Colombia, hit 5.61 million tonnes (1.3 million bpd) in March, the highest in Reuters' data going back to 2006.

In the same month, China's crude oil deficit came in a hefty 15 million tonnes after touching a record 19 million tonnes in December 2016 as domestic production shrank while imports surged, customs data showed.

"Record imports are being driven by falling production, higher refinery runs, huge infrastructure and SPR (Strategic Petroleum Reserves) builds," Virendra Chauhan from consultancy Energy Aspects said. The agency expects Asia's crude imports, led by China, to rise by 900,000 bpd on year in 2017.

Mexico's Pemex to launch coking plant tender for Tula refinery - 路透新闻

{{20170330T000734.936+0000}}Mexico's Pemex to launch coking plant tender for Tula refineryMEXICO CITY, March 29 (Reuters) - Mexican state oil company Pemex [PEMX.UL] expects to launch a tender in the next few weeks to find a partner to develop and operate a new coking plant at its Tula refinery, a $2.1 billion project designed to boost output of gasoline, a company source said.

Japan's Mitzui & Co <8031.T>, South Korea's SK, Italy's Eni , China's PetroChina Co Ltd <601857.SS> and Sinopec <0386.HK>, and international oil majors Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Chevron Corp have all expressed interest, the source said.

Two years of sagging oil prices and mounting debt have forced the Mexican oil firm to seek equity partners to help fund key projects.

The new plant will be located adjacent to Pemex's existing Tula refinery, in the central state of Hidalgo.

The facility, Pemex's second largest among six domestic refineries, can process 315,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, but is currently processing just 195,000 bpd, or only 62 percent of its capacity, according to the latest Pemex data.

Tula, like two other Pemex refineries, lacks coking capacity, which boosts production of higher-value fuels like gasoline from Mexico's increasingly heavy crude production.

In 2015, Pemex said it signed a contract with ICA Fluor for engineering, procurement and construction for an initial phase of projects to boost gasoline and diesel output and reduce fuel oil output by building a coking plant. Reuters was not able to confirm the status of the project with ICA Fluor, a joint venture between construction firm ICA and Fluor Corp .

In 2016, the state-owned oil company presented a business plan that included the "Tolling coker Tula Alliance" project, as well as partnerships to improve operations and/or reconfigure the Tula, Salamanca and Salina Cruz refineries.

Pemex has often said it is looking for partners to improve the performance of its refineries, which currently process about 915,000 bpd of crude, well below their combined capacity of 1.6 million bpd.

Two senior Sinopec oil traders quit, one joins private e-platform  - 路透新闻

{{20170329T094959.720+0000}}Two senior Sinopec oil traders quit, one joins private e-platform By Chen Aizhu

BEIJING, March 29 (Reuters) - Two senior oil traders at Sinopec Corp <0386.HK> have resigned, with one set to join a private Chinese e-commerce commodity platform, two sources at the top Asian refiner told Reuters.

Xu Qing is leaving his post as vice president of Sinopec Fuel Oil Sales Co to become a senior executive with privately-owned ChinaYIE, a Shanghai-based online commodity platform active in chemicals trading, according to the sources. They declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak with media.

ChinaYIE, which also trades non-ferrous metals and steel, recorded annual trade turnover of 167.4 billion yuan ($24 billion) last year, according to its website. Calls to the company's main line went unanswered.

Xu was previously the Singapore-based head of Asia operations for Unipec, Sinopec's trading company that competes with independent traders such as Vitol and oil majors including Royal Dutch Shell [nL3N1H521X]

The sources added that Ren Shiye, with some 15 years experience in physical and paper trading of refined fuels like diesel and kerosene, had quit as deputy head of Unipec's products team several weeks ago and it is not clear which company he will join next.

Xu declined to comment. Ren was not immediately available for comment.

Sinopec's spokesman Lu Dapeng did not comment specifically on the moves, but said talent turnaround is a normal phenomenon for global companies.

Private Chinese entities are becoming magnets for luring seasoned traders away from state-owned energy firms like Sinopec, while global trading houses like Vitol and Trafigura [TRAFG.UL] used to be more popular.

"Private Chinese entities are culturally easier to adapt to, while western trading houses tend to be overly profit-driven," said a Beijing-based senior oil trader.

One of Unipec's most senior departures was its former head of crude trading Cui Zhenchu, now with CEFC China Energy, a rapidly growing privately-run oil and finance conglomerate. [nL4N117362]

A recent boom in China's independent oil refineries has led to dozens of oil traders at state-owned companies moving to join these small, nimble companies, as well as majors and trading houses expanding to deal with these firms. [nL4N18Y33W]

UPDATE 2-Sinopec overhauls fuel buying policy in new blow to teapots  - 路透新闻

{{20170328T114831.046+0000}}UPDATE 2-Sinopec overhauls fuel buying policy in new blow to teapots (Adds impact on independent refiners; analyst, refiner comment)

By Chen Aizhu and Meng Meng

BEIJING, March 28 (Reuters) - Asia's top refiner Sinopec Corp <0386.HK> said on Tuesday that it will begin buying gasoline and diesel fuel from third parties through its central office in Beijing, a move that puts further limits on China's independent oil refiners.

In an e-mailed statement, Sinopec said it would start from April to centralize refined fuel purchasing to balance supply, cut costs and boost efficiency, without giving details of the plan.

Three industry officials informed of the plan said the fuel marketing office at Sinopec's headquarters will negotiate directly with China's independent refiners, sometimes known as teapots, and other third-party suppliers over volumes and prices for gasoline and diesel.

Previously, Sinopec bought fuel through scores of its regional marketing offices that set prices and dealt with suppliers on their own.

By consolidating their buying, Sinopec's plan further restricts the independent refiners that have already been required to sell their refined fuel inside China after the government scrapped their export licenses. [nL4N1EB30D]

Michal Meidan, Asia analyst with consultants Energy Aspects, said the plan is likely to weigh on teapots' margins, even though volumes of products sold to Sinopec may not fall significantly.

"The aim is to ensure purchases of high quality fuels and improve Sinopec's bargaining power," said Meidan, adding that the centralized buying plan may also potentially reduce the third-party volumes Sinopec buys.

Apart from the independents, mostly based in Shandong province in eastern China, refineries operated by China National Chemical Corp (ChemChina) and state-owned Sinochem are also on the suppliers' list.

While Sinopec's centralisation plan impacts the independent refiners, the change could serve as an unintended impetus for large independents to step up investments in logistics to win fuel customers outside the state refiners, said Zhang Liucheng, vice president of Shandong Dongming Petrochemical Group, the country's largest independent refiner.

"It's a rare chance for us to make an aggressive push to reach clients beyond the oil majors, the thousands of private gas stations." said Zhang, referring to the country's extensive privately owned fuel retailers.

Under the plan, Sinopec's Shandong-based marketing offices are allowed to maintain direct procurement with Shandong-based independent plants, but the volume is considered fractional versus Sinopec's total third-party procurement, said Zhang, who has received Sinopec's notice on the new purchase program.

{{20170328T085635.468+0000}}UPDATE 1-Sinopec says to centralize third-party fuel purchasing from April(Adds details of the plan based on sources)

BEIJING, March 28 (Reuters) - Top Asian refiner Sinopec Corp <0386.HK> said on Tuesday that its fuel marketing division plans to centralise third-party refined fuel buying at its Beijing headquarters from April 1.

"Such a plan will help balancing fuel supply, cut costs and boost efficiency," said the company said in an emailed statement to Reuters, without giving the details of the new scheme.

Three industry officials informed of the plan said starting April 1, the fuel marketing office at Sinopec's headquarters will negotiate directly with China's independent oil refiners, sometimes known as teapots, and other third-party suppliers over volumes and prices for gasoline and diesel.

Previously, Sinopec bought fuel through scores of regional marketing offices that set prices and dealt with suppliers on their own.

Centralising purchasing will give the state-run oil major better bargaining power over prices, potentially boosting profits for the fuels distribution business ahead of a stock market listing, two of the three sources said. [nL4N1EU1X6]

Unipec vies for top global oil trader spot with 10 pct volume growth in 2017 -official - 路透新闻

{{20170328T064219.501+0000}}Unipec vies for top global oil trader spot with 10 pct volume growth in 2017 -official* Unipec oil, gas volume reach 370 million T in 2016

* Trade volumes rise 10 pct annually since 2011

* U.S. crude shipments, new Africa assets to boost trade

By Florence Tan

SINGAPORE, March 28 (Reuters) - Unipec, a unit of Asia's largest refiner Sinopec <600028.SS>, expects its oil and gas turnover volumes to grow by 10 percent for the sixth year in 2017 as it vies for the top trading spot with Vitol, the world's biggest independent oil trader.

The trading unit's growth will come from expanded storage and logistics capability, including new assets in South Africa, and rising shipments of U.S. crude to Asia, said a Unipec senior official who declined to be named due to company policy.

"Our trade volume has been growing at 10 percent a year since 2011," the official said. "This year we're also expecting a 10 percent growth as we have increased our storage capacity and enlarged our global logistics capability."

Unipec's trade volumes for crude, oil products and LNG reached 370 million tonnes (2.7 billion barrels) of oil equivalent in 2016 with revenue of more than $100 billion, the official said.

The volumes claimed by the Unipec official - most of which are supplied to Sinopec refineries - exceed Vitol's [VITOLV.UL] reported trade turnover in barrels, but the Chinese trading unit's revenues do not appear to beat the Swiss trader's income.

Vitol said on Friday its crude oil and product trading rose to 2.60 billion barrels last year, or more than 7 million barrels per day (bpd), bringing in $152 billion. [nL5N1H11TP]

Sinopec purchased Chevron Corp's South African assets and its subsidiary in Botswana to secure the Chinese state company's first major refinery in Africa. [nL3N1GZ3PH]

The assets include a 100,000 bpd oil refinery in Cape Town, a lubricants plant in Durban as well as 820 petrol stations and other oil storage facilities.

Unipec has also seen an increase in its U.S. crude shipments to Asia this year, the official said, as shale oil production increases with improved prices and traders export surplus supplies to meet growing demand in the east.

For LNG, Unipec's trade volumes remained small at just over 2 million tonnes last year, the official said.

BEIJING, March 22 (Reuters) - The head of crude oil trading at Chinese state energy giant PetroChina <0857.HK> has resigned after 20 years with the company, a rare departure from a state-owned enterprise known for retaining talent in the midst of rapid expansion.

Li Chuang, 42, head of the crude oil department at PetroChina's trading vehicle Chinaoil, resigned in February, having spent the last two years leading a global team of nearly 50 crude oil traders and marketers.

Chinaoil has chosen as Li's replacement Zhang Peng, a deputy general manager in the same department at Chinaoil who is experienced in derivatives and risk management, said two senior trading sources based in Beijing.

Li declined to give a reason for his resignation. The two sources said he is on gardening leave for three months before making his next move.

PetroChina did not respond to a request for comment.

Chinaoil in 2015 traded a record 151 million tonnes, or roughly 3 million barrels per day of crude oil and refined fuel, versus 22 million tonnes in 2001, posting yearly average growth of 15 percent over that time span, according to its website.

Its volume turnover in 2015 was slightly more than that of Swiss trader Trafigura [TRAFG.UL] for the same year and about half that of Vitol [VITOLV.UL], the world's largest oil dealer.

Chinaoil has since the mid-1990s grown a group of fresh university graduates into seasoned traders and managed to keep most of the top performers.

They include Zhao Yong, the former head of crude trading who is now president of Chinaoil; Zheng Jun, a vice president and another former head of crude trading; and Zhang Tong, another vice president and formerly head of the products team.

Li said his departure would be seen as more normal from global oil majors such as BP or Shell , adding that Chinaoil has been the most successful in retaining talent compared with other Chinese state traders.

Since Beijing began freeing up its oil import and export markets in late 2015, China's independent refineries, global majors and international commodity houses have hired away dozens of traders from Chinese state firms such as Sinochem [SASADA.UL] and CNOOC [SASACY.UL], seeking staff with the knowledge and skills to profit from the newly liberated sector. Chinaoil has suffered the least number of departures. [nL4N18Y33W]

Apart from supplying crude and trading refined fuel for parent PetroChina's refineries in China, Chinaoil owns refinery stakes in Japan, Singapore, Scotland and France.

It is one of the few Asia-based trading companies that actively moves crude from Europe, the United States and Canada back to the region.

In one highlight of Li's tenure over the last two years, Chinaoil emerged in late 2015 as an aggressive buyer in Asia's spot oil market, facing off with rival Unipec, trading arm of top refiner Sinopec <600028.SS>, in a battle for influence over the region's crude benchmark.

RPT-Beset by delays, Myanmar-China oil pipeline nears start-up - 路透新闻

{{20170321T231311.668+0000}}RPT-Beset by delays, Myanmar-China oil pipeline nears start-up(Repeats item issued late Tuesday, with no change to text)

* PetroChina and Yangon near deal on crude supplies

* Pipeline to supply new refinery in China's Yunnan

* Tanker with crude for pipeline to arrive this week

* Long-delayed project tests China-Myanmar relations

By Yimou Lee, Chen Aizhu and Shwe Yee Saw Myint

YANGON/BEIJING, March 21 (Reuters) - Nearly a decade in the making, a project to pump oil 770 km (480 miles) across Myanmar to southwest China is set for imminent start-up, with a supertanker nearing the port of Kyauk Phyu, marking the opening of a new oil trading route.

Dogged by sensitive relations between Naypyitaw and Beijing, the $1.5 billion oil pipeline has been sitting empty for two years, but the two sides are now close to a deal, said Myanmar-based government and industry sources, despite some last-minute tensions.

An agreement between China's PetroChina <601857.SS> and Myanmar's government will allow the state energy giant to import overseas oil via the Bay of Bengal and pump it through the pipeline to supply a new 260,000-barrels-per-day (bpd) refinery in landlocked Yunnan province.

The new oil gateway fits with China's "One Belt, One Road" ambitions, linking it with central Asia and Europe, and will provide a more direct alternative route to sending Middle Eastern oil via the crowded Malacca Straits and Singapore.

It would also be a rare win for China in Myanmar after a diplomatic offensive aimed at forging better ties with its resource-rich neighbour, which has often been wary of Beijing's economic clout.

Aung Myat Soe, deputy director of planning under the state-owned Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), said the project was awaiting a final sign-off by the Minister of Electricity and Energy.

Major issues including transport tariffs and Myanmar's tax take on the oil have been settled, but port fees have yet to be finalised, said a Myanmar-based industry source familiar with the matter.

"The two sides are working to finalize the terms and sign the contract," the person said, declining to be named as the information is not public.

"I can't say for sure when the deal would be sealed - it could be in a couple of days or early April."

The pipeline will have an eventual capacity of 400,000 bpd, about 5 percent of China's daily import demand, but the start-up of the Yunnan refinery has been held up as PetroChina and Myanmar negotiated final terms for delivering the oil.

PetroChina plans to start test production at the refinery in June, aiming to expand its foothold in China's fuel-short southwest which has so far relied largely on rival Sinopec <600028.SS> for supplies, said two Beijing-based oil officials familiar with the Yunnan refinery.

Before then, PetroChina is expected to purchase another 7 million barrels of crude for the pipeline, to stock up fuel for about one month's production at its new refinery, said one of the officials.

SQUABBLING NEIGHBOURS

While the deal is still to be finalised, oil is already on its way to supply the pipeline, straining relations with Myanmar.

Shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows the oil tanker United Dynamic, carrying one million barrels of Azeri crude, is currently off the coast of southern India and expected to unload its cargo at Kyauk Phyu this week.

A Myanmar government official said there had been "a big argument with the Chinese" over the move to ship in crude before the contract was finalised, while a second official said the entry of the tanker was pending approval from Myanmar's navy.

PetroChina did not respond to requests for comment.

Any delay would be costly for the oil shipper, which is carrying crude worth over $50 million and which has a daily tanker charter cost of nearly $20,000, excluding fuel and crew costs.

The deal is also controversial in China as it has been tainted by a graft probe into PetroChina's ex-chairman Jiang Jiemin, a supporter of the project.

Critics have raised conerns about the economic viability of the project, which also includes a natural gas pipeline, which was touted as providing "strategic new channels" for China's energy needs.

At the same time, the prolonged squabbling over key features of the deal, first discussed back in 2004, has soured Chinese enthusiasm for the project.

"There are open questions about the economics and future cooperation with Myanmar, given the repeated delays and under-utilization," noted a senior PetroChina official who requested anonymity as he's not authorized to speak to press. [nL3N1C633Y]

UPDATE 4-Indonesia police say Interpol issues red notices for 3 Sinopec execs - 路透新闻

{{20170321T111755.687+0000}}UPDATE 4-Indonesia police say Interpol issues red notices for 3 Sinopec execs* Project was touted as region's biggest oil storage terminal

* Police say three execs suspected of alleged embezzlement

* Indonesia's resources sector has been riddled with graft

(Adds comment from Sinopec)

By Fergus Jensen and Cindy Silviana

JAKARTA, March 21 (Reuters) - Indonesian police said on Tuesday Interpol has issued red notices, the closest to an international arrest warrant, for three Chinese executives suspected of fraud linked to a more than $800 million Sinopec oil terminal development in Indonesia.

China Petroleum and Chemical Corp, or Sinopec, is the second major Chinese state oil firm in less than three years to find staff facing allegations of corruption in Indonesia, where the resources sector is riddled with graft and legal and contractual uncertainty.

"The three red notices have been published for those wanted people," said National Police spokesman Boy Rafli Amar.

Indonesian authorities filed a request for Interpol assistance on Feb. 21 regarding the three executives, suspects in the alleged embezzlement of an undisclosed sum of money from the West Point Terminal project, Amar said. He identified the three as West Point Terminal finance director Zhang Jun, chief executive Feng Zhigang and chairman Ye Zhijun.

In a statement on its official microblog, Sinopec said it had not received any red notices from Interpol, was checking relevant information about the project and that the company and its subsidiaries operated in accordance with the law.

Reuters has not yet been able to find telephone numbers or email addresses for the three executives, so has been unable to contact them for comment.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she had seen reports about the red notices, but was not aware of specifics.

Interpol's General Secretariat press office said in an emailed response to questions on the matter that it did not "comment on specific cases or individuals except in special circumstances".

A red notice is Interpol's highest alert and is a request to locate and provisionally arrest an individual pending extradition. It is not an international arrest warrant as Interpol cannot compel any member country to arrest an individual who is the subject of a red notice.

Indonesia, an archipelago of some 250 million people rich in resources, is routinely ranked by watchdog Transparency International as one of the world's most corrupt countries.

Former Indonesian energy minister Jero Wacik is serving an eight-year prison term for involvement in extortion and kickbacks worth about $840,000.

SERIES OF SETBACKS

Defrizal Djamaris, a lawyer representing West Point Terminal's 5-percent stakeholder, PT Mas Capital Trust (MCT), said MCT reported suspicions of fraud on the project to local police in 2015.

The red notices were issued because the three executives had left the country and "not cooperated" with local police investigations, Djamaris said. The police's Amar did not confirm this.

The West Point Terminal was touted to be Southeast Asia's largest and was initially expected to be operational by mid-2016, but has faced a series of setbacks including a lawsuit filed by Indonesian shareholders in November. [nFWN1DG088]

The project in Indonesia's Batam free trade zone to the south of Singapore is 95-percent owned by Sinopec Kantons Holdings <0934.HK>, a subsidiary of Sinopec <0386.HK> <600028.SS>. [nL3N1C33G9]

Sinopec Kantons bought into the project in January 2012, aiming to develop a 2.6 million-tonne storage facility worth more than $800 million.

The project was delayed by several years due to slow demand for tank space, Reuters reported. An official at Indonesia's energy ministry said the downstream operations permit for the West Point Terminal expired in late 2014.

Sinopec's only other Indonesian asset is an 18-percent stake in Chevron's deep water project, bought in 2010.

Sinopec Kantons, which is one of Sinopec's smallest subsidiaries, was not immediately available for comment.

* Deal would give Sinopec first refinery in Africa

By Jessica Resnick-Ault and Florence Tan

NEW YORK/SINGAPORE, March 17 (Reuters) - China's Sinopec <600028.SS> is nearing a deal to buy Chevron's South African oil assets for up to $1 billion to secure its first major refinery on the continent, several people familiar with the matter said.

China Petroleum and Chemical Corp, or Sinopec, Asia's largest oil refiner, was the last bidder remaining, and close to a deal with Chevron after an auction that spanned more than a year for its refinery, retails business and storage terminals.

French oil firm Total and commodity traders Glencore and Gunvor looked at the assets, Reuters reported last year.

The South Africa government's desire to keep the refinery operating has nevertheless proven to be a major stumbling point for buyers who would prefer to convert the site into a more profitable storage terminal, sources said.

Sinopec is in discussions with the government on ways to keep the 110,000 barrels per day refinery in Cape Town running, but talks could still fail, sources said.

The sources declined to be identified because they were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly.

Chinese oil companies and merchant traders have become more visible in chasing refinery assets that come on the market as oil majors reshape asset portfolios. [nL8N1CU16Z]

Sinopec declined to comment.

Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall said "the process of soliciting expressions of interest in the 75 percent shareholding is ongoing". Plans to sell the stake in the South African business, including the Cape Town refinery, were first announced in January 2016.

Besides the refinery, Chevron has interests in a lubricants plant in Durban on the east coast, storage tanks and a network of Caltex service stations, making it one of South Africa's top five petroleum brands.

Financial advisor Rothschild & Co is helping Chevron on the sale of the assets.

The remaining 25 percent interest is held by a consortium of Black Economic Empowerment shareholders and an employee trust.

PetroChina's head of crude oil trading resigns，replaced by deputy - 路透新闻

{{20170322T070712.310+0000}}PetroChina's head of crude oil trading resigns，replaced by deputyBy Chen Aizhu

BEIJING, March 22 (Reuters) - The head of crude oil trading at Chinese state energy giant PetroChina <0857.HK> has resigned after 20 years with the company, a rare departure from a state-owned enterprise known for retaining talent in the midst of rapid expansion.

Li Chuang, 42, head of the crude oil department at PetroChina's trading vehicle Chinaoil, resigned in February, having spent the last two years leading a global team of nearly 50 crude oil traders and marketers.

Chinaoil has chosen as Li's replacement Zhang Peng, a deputy general manager in the same department at Chinaoil who is experienced in derivatives and risk management, said two senior trading sources based in Beijing.

Li declined to give a reason for his resignation. The two sources said he is on gardening leave for three months before making his next move.

PetroChina did not respond to a request for comment.

Chinaoil in 2015 traded a record 151 million tonnes, or roughly 3 million barrels per day of crude oil and refined fuel, versus 22 million tonnes in 2001, posting yearly average growth of 15 percent over that time span, according to its website.

Its volume turnover in 2015 was slightly more than that of Swiss trader Trafigura [TRAFG.UL] for the same year and about half that of Vitol [VITOLV.UL], the world's largest oil dealer.

Chinaoil has since the mid-1990s grown a group of fresh university graduates into seasoned traders and managed to keep most of the top performers.

They include Zhao Yong, the former head of crude trading who is now president of Chinaoil; Zheng Jun, a vice president and another former head of crude trading; and Zhang Tong, another vice president and formerly head of the products team.

Li said his departure would be seen as more normal from global oil majors such as BP or Shell , adding that Chinaoil has been the most successful in retaining talent compared with other Chinese state traders.

Since Beijing began freeing up its oil import and export markets in late 2015, China's independent refineries, global majors and international commodity houses have hired away dozens of traders from Chinese state firms such as Sinochem [SASADA.UL] and CNOOC [SASACY.UL], seeking staff with the knowledge and skills to profit from the newly liberated sector. Chinaoil has suffered the least number of departures. [nL4N18Y33W]

Apart from supplying crude and trading refined fuel for parent PetroChina's refineries in China, Chinaoil owns refinery stakes in Japan, Singapore, Scotland and France.

It is one of the few Asia-based trading companies that actively moves crude from Europe, the United States and Canada back to the region.

In one highlight of Li's tenure over the last two years, Chinaoil emerged in late 2015 as an aggressive buyer in Asia's spot oil market, facing off with rival Unipec, trading arm of top refiner Sinopec <600028.SS>, in a battle for influence over the region's crude benchmark.

RPT-Beset by delays, Myanmar-China oil pipeline nears start-up - 路透新闻

{{20170321T231311.668+0000}}RPT-Beset by delays, Myanmar-China oil pipeline nears start-up(Repeats item issued late Tuesday, with no change to text)

* PetroChina and Yangon near deal on crude supplies

* Pipeline to supply new refinery in China's Yunnan

* Tanker with crude for pipeline to arrive this week

* Long-delayed project tests China-Myanmar relations

By Yimou Lee, Chen Aizhu and Shwe Yee Saw Myint

YANGON/BEIJING, March 21 (Reuters) - Nearly a decade in the making, a project to pump oil 770 km (480 miles) across Myanmar to southwest China is set for imminent start-up, with a supertanker nearing the port of Kyauk Phyu, marking the opening of a new oil trading route.

Dogged by sensitive relations between Naypyitaw and Beijing, the $1.5 billion oil pipeline has been sitting empty for two years, but the two sides are now close to a deal, said Myanmar-based government and industry sources, despite some last-minute tensions.

An agreement between China's PetroChina <601857.SS> and Myanmar's government will allow the state energy giant to import overseas oil via the Bay of Bengal and pump it through the pipeline to supply a new 260,000-barrels-per-day (bpd) refinery in landlocked Yunnan province.

The new oil gateway fits with China's "One Belt, One Road" ambitions, linking it with central Asia and Europe, and will provide a more direct alternative route to sending Middle Eastern oil via the crowded Malacca Straits and Singapore.

It would also be a rare win for China in Myanmar after a diplomatic offensive aimed at forging better ties with its resource-rich neighbour, which has often been wary of Beijing's economic clout.

Aung Myat Soe, deputy director of planning under the state-owned Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), said the project was awaiting a final sign-off by the Minister of Electricity and Energy.

Major issues including transport tariffs and Myanmar's tax take on the oil have been settled, but port fees have yet to be finalised, said a Myanmar-based industry source familiar with the matter.

"The two sides are working to finalize the terms and sign the contract," the person said, declining to be named as the information is not public.

"I can't say for sure when the deal would be sealed - it could be in a couple of days or early April."

The pipeline will have an eventual capacity of 400,000 bpd, about 5 percent of China's daily import demand, but the start-up of the Yunnan refinery has been held up as PetroChina and Myanmar negotiated final terms for delivering the oil.

PetroChina plans to start test production at the refinery in June, aiming to expand its foothold in China's fuel-short southwest which has so far relied largely on rival Sinopec <600028.SS> for supplies, said two Beijing-based oil officials familiar with the Yunnan refinery.

Before then, PetroChina is expected to purchase another 7 million barrels of crude for the pipeline, to stock up fuel for about one month's production at its new refinery, said one of the officials.

SQUABBLING NEIGHBOURS

While the deal is still to be finalised, oil is already on its way to supply the pipeline, straining relations with Myanmar.

Shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows the oil tanker United Dynamic, carrying one million barrels of Azeri crude, is currently off the coast of southern India and expected to unload its cargo at Kyauk Phyu this week.

A Myanmar government official said there had been "a big argument with the Chinese" over the move to ship in crude before the contract was finalised, while a second official said the entry of the tanker was pending approval from Myanmar's navy.

PetroChina did not respond to requests for comment.

Any delay would be costly for the oil shipper, which is carrying crude worth over $50 million and which has a daily tanker charter cost of nearly $20,000, excluding fuel and crew costs.

The deal is also controversial in China as it has been tainted by a graft probe into PetroChina's ex-chairman Jiang Jiemin, a supporter of the project.

Critics have raised conerns about the economic viability of the project, which also includes a natural gas pipeline, which was touted as providing "strategic new channels" for China's energy needs.

At the same time, the prolonged squabbling over key features of the deal, first discussed back in 2004, has soured Chinese enthusiasm for the project.

"There are open questions about the economics and future cooperation with Myanmar, given the repeated delays and under-utilization," noted a senior PetroChina official who requested anonymity as he's not authorized to speak to press. [nL3N1C633Y]

UPDATE 4-Indonesia police say Interpol issues red notices for 3 Sinopec execs - 路透新闻

{{20170321T111755.687+0000}}UPDATE 4-Indonesia police say Interpol issues red notices for 3 Sinopec execs* Project was touted as region's biggest oil storage terminal

* Police say three execs suspected of alleged embezzlement

* Indonesia's resources sector has been riddled with graft

(Adds comment from Sinopec)

By Fergus Jensen and Cindy Silviana

JAKARTA, March 21 (Reuters) - Indonesian police said on Tuesday Interpol has issued red notices, the closest to an international arrest warrant, for three Chinese executives suspected of fraud linked to a more than $800 million Sinopec oil terminal development in Indonesia.

China Petroleum and Chemical Corp, or Sinopec, is the second major Chinese state oil firm in less than three years to find staff facing allegations of corruption in Indonesia, where the resources sector is riddled with graft and legal and contractual uncertainty.

"The three red notices have been published for those wanted people," said National Police spokesman Boy Rafli Amar.

Indonesian authorities filed a request for Interpol assistance on Feb. 21 regarding the three executives, suspects in the alleged embezzlement of an undisclosed sum of money from the West Point Terminal project, Amar said. He identified the three as West Point Terminal finance director Zhang Jun, chief executive Feng Zhigang and chairman Ye Zhijun.

In a statement on its official microblog, Sinopec said it had not received any red notices from Interpol, was checking relevant information about the project and that the company and its subsidiaries operated in accordance with the law.

Reuters has not yet been able to find telephone numbers or email addresses for the three executives, so has been unable to contact them for comment.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she had seen reports about the red notices, but was not aware of specifics.

Interpol's General Secretariat press office said in an emailed response to questions on the matter that it did not "comment on specific cases or individuals except in special circumstances".

A red notice is Interpol's highest alert and is a request to locate and provisionally arrest an individual pending extradition. It is not an international arrest warrant as Interpol cannot compel any member country to arrest an individual who is the subject of a red notice.

Indonesia, an archipelago of some 250 million people rich in resources, is routinely ranked by watchdog Transparency International as one of the world's most corrupt countries.

Former Indonesian energy minister Jero Wacik is serving an eight-year prison term for involvement in extortion and kickbacks worth about $840,000.

SERIES OF SETBACKS

Defrizal Djamaris, a lawyer representing West Point Terminal's 5-percent stakeholder, PT Mas Capital Trust (MCT), said MCT reported suspicions of fraud on the project to local police in 2015.

The red notices were issued because the three executives had left the country and "not cooperated" with local police investigations, Djamaris said. The police's Amar did not confirm this.

The West Point Terminal was touted to be Southeast Asia's largest and was initially expected to be operational by mid-2016, but has faced a series of setbacks including a lawsuit filed by Indonesian shareholders in November. [nFWN1DG088]

The project in Indonesia's Batam free trade zone to the south of Singapore is 95-percent owned by Sinopec Kantons Holdings <0934.HK>, a subsidiary of Sinopec <0386.HK> <600028.SS>. [nL3N1C33G9]

Sinopec Kantons bought into the project in January 2012, aiming to develop a 2.6 million-tonne storage facility worth more than $800 million.

The project was delayed by several years due to slow demand for tank space, Reuters reported. An official at Indonesia's energy ministry said the downstream operations permit for the West Point Terminal expired in late 2014.

Sinopec's only other Indonesian asset is an 18-percent stake in Chevron's deep water project, bought in 2010.

Sinopec Kantons, which is one of Sinopec's smallest subsidiaries, was not immediately available for comment.

{{20170321T010555.939+0000}}Indonesia police say Interpol issues red notices for 3 Sinopec execsJAKARTA, March 21 (Reuters) - Indonesian police said on Tuesday Interpol has issued red notices, the closest to an international arrest warrant, for three Chinese executives suspected of fraud linked to an $850 million Sinopec oil storage terminal development in Indonesia.

"The three red notices have been published for those wanted people," National Police spokesman Boy Rafli Amar said.

He said Indonesian authorities filed the request for Interpol assistance on Feb. 21 and identified the Sinopec executives named in the red notices as Zhang Jun, Feng Zhigang, and Ye Zhijun.

A Sinopec spokesman declined to comment.

NEW YORK/SINGAPORE, March 17 (Reuters) - China's Sinopec <600028.SS> is nearing a deal to buy Chevron's South African oil assets for up to $1 billion to secure its first major refinery on the continent, several people familiar with the matter said.

China Petroleum and Chemical Corp, or Sinopec, Asia's largest oil refiner, was the last bidder remaining, and close to a deal with Chevron after an auction that spanned more than a year for its refinery, retails business and storage terminals.

French oil firm Total and commodity traders Glencore and Gunvor looked at the assets, Reuters reported last year.

The South Africa government's desire to keep the refinery operating has nevertheless proven to be a major stumbling point for buyers who would prefer to convert the site into a more profitable storage terminal, sources said.

Sinopec is in discussions with the government on ways to keep the 110,000 barrels per day refinery in Cape Town running, but talks could still fail, sources said.

The sources declined to be identified because they were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly.

Sinopec declined to comment.

Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall said "the process of soliciting expressions of interest in the 75 percent shareholding is ongoing". Plans to sell the stake in the South African business, including the Cape Town refinery, were first announced in January 2016.

Besides the refinery, Chevron has interests in a lubricants plant in Durban on the east coast, storage tanks and a network of Caltex service stations, making it one of South Africa's top five petroleum brands.

Financial advisor Rothschild & Co is helping Chevron on the sale of the assets.

The remaining 25 percent interest is held by a consortium of Black Economic Empowerment shareholders and an employee trust.

Sinopec to start operating Zhanjiang commercial oil tanks; SPR site delayed -sources  - 路透新闻

{{20170302T104822.198+0000}}Sinopec to start operating Zhanjiang commercial oil tanks; SPR site delayed -sources * Commercial crude storage of 8.5 mln bbls due start by June

* Sinopec building a rock cavern strategic reserve base nearby

* Sinopec building a greenfield refinery in Zhanjiang

By Chen Aizhu

BEIJING, March 2 (Reuters) - Sinopec Corp <0386.HK> is expected to start operating by June a new commercial crude oil tank farm in the southern Chinese city of Zhanjiang, where a large strategic reserve site is also under construction, three industry sources said this week.

The new commercial tanks will store 8.5 million barrels, equivalent to over four supertankers.

The tank farm consists of twelve tanks of 100,000 cubic metres each and three tanks of 50,000 cubic metres in Zhanjiang in Guangdong province, according to three industry sources with knowledge of the facility.

Sinopec is applying with customs authorities to qualify the facility as a tax-bond site before the start of operations, said one of the sources.

Meanwhile, in the mountainous outskirts of Zhanjiang, Chinese engineers are digging the rock caverns to build a national strategic reserve site able to store about 31.5 million barrels of crude oil, two of the sources said.

The reserve project, located in Lianjiang county of Zhanjiang city is expected to start operating in early 2018, the sources said, nearly two years behind an earlier timeline estimated by market analysts.

This would be China's second rock cavern oil reserve after one started up in eastern Shandong province before mid-2015.

Sinopec engineers are the builders and the state refiner was expected also to manage it on behalf of the government when it comes on line, industry officials have said.

"For the rock caverns, you'll need more time for geological survey and designs, and more safety measures," said one of the sources.

The sources declined to be named as they are not authorized to speak to press.

A Sinopec spokesperson said the company does not comment on operational matters.

Sinopec currently operates the Dongxing refinery of 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) in Zhanjiang and a 360,000 bpd refinery in nearby Maoming city. Both plants will be connected with the new commercial storage by pipelines, the sources with knowledge of the commercial storage site said.

The refiner has also started in December building a large greenfield plant at Donghai Island, about 10 km from the port of Zhanjiang, that includes a 200,000 bpd refinery and an 800,000 tonne-per-year ethylene complex. [nL4N1E11YY]

As part of the new investment, Sinopec is expected to add a new crude tank farm and a crude import terminal that can handle vessels up to 300,000 deadweight tonnes (dwt).

Sinopec currently operates two terminals with the Zhanjiang port authority that can receive 300,000-dwt crude oil tankers, the sources said.

UPDATE 1-China's Sinopec to spend $29 bln upgrading four refining bases  - 路透新闻

{{20170302T095548.990+0000}}UPDATE 1-China's Sinopec to spend $29 bln upgrading four refining bases (Changes sourcing to Sinopec, adds details)

BEIJING, March 2 (Reuters) - China's Sinopec group, parent of Sinopec Corp <0386.HK>, will invest 200 billion yuan ($29.05 billion) to upgrade four refining bases between 2016 and 2020 to produce higher-quality fuels, the company said in an emailed statement on Thursday.

Sinopec's upgrades come as China, the world's second-biggest oil consumer, is embracing more stringent fuel standards in its battle against pollution and suffering an overall glut in refining capacity.

After the upgrades, the total refining capacity of the four refining sites will reach 130 million tonnes per year, or 2.6 million barrels per day (bpd), while ethylene capacity will reach 9 million tonnes per year (tpy), Sinopec said.

The sites are in the cities of Shanghai, Nanjing and Zhenhai on the east coast and Maoming-Zhanjiang in southern Guangdong province.

After the expansions, the bases will make up 45 percent of Sinopec's total refining capcity and 65 percent of its ethylene capacity.

"It's a strategic move that fits the global industrial trend for clustered and scaled growth and helps transform China's petrochemical products to medium and high quality," the company chairman Wang Yupu was cited as saying in the statement.

Between the four bases, Sinopec will be able to optimise the product structure and reduce logistics cost.

Sinopec, Asia's largest refiner, started construction in December of a greenfield oil refinery and petrochemical complex in Zhanjiang that includes a 200,000 bpd refinery and an 800,000 tpy ethylene complex.

The refinery will mainly produce gasoline and diesel that meets the "national six" specificiations, up from the previous Euro V guidelines that cap sulphur content at 10 parts per million (ppm), said Sinopec in the statement.

The new plant will be geared toward producing gasoline and aviation fuel at the expense of diesel, the firm said.

After the upgrades, Sinopec estimates the four sites will generate revenue of 800 billion yuan by 2020, based on $54 a barrel crude oil prices.
