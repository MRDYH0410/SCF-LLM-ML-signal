Aug 3 (Reuters) - Indian Oil Corp Ltd said it is in talks with its partners to scout for an alternative, cheaper site for the Pacific Northwest LNG terminal after the recent pullout of the lead developer cast doubt on the future of the Canadian project.

Malaysia's state-owned Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) [PETR.UL], which held a majority 62 percent stake in the proposed C$36 billion ($29 billion) Pacific NorthWest LNG Project in British Columbia, said last week it was abandoning the plan due to weak global prices. [nL1N1KG1CB]

Sanjiv Singh, chairman of Indian Oil, which has a 10 percent stake in the Canadian project, said the company remained interest in going ahead with at least part of the plan.

"We are very much positive going ahead with the upstream part of it, which is gas production. Liquefaction and transportation further in the liquid form we are not pursuing, I mean, we don't want to pursue very aggressively as of now," he told a news conference.

"We are also looking at a different location which might be much less expensive than the earlier one," Singh said.

Indian Oil's head of business development, G.K. Satish, said consortium partners are talking about alternatives. He declined to comment on write-offs IOC might be taking in the next quarter for investment in the Canadian LNG project.

Petronas's pullout dealt a blow to the project and its partners which would now have to invest additional capital to complete the project.

Indian Oil is the first partner to suggest the project could still go ahead, in modified form.

"Cost of liquefaction, transportation and retail outside Canada has gone up. And today we are finding that it may not be very attractive at the present prices," Singh said.

The other partners in the project are Chinese oil and gas giant Sinopec <600028.SS>, with 15 percent, Japex Montney Ltd, with 10 percent, and Petroleum Brunei, with 3 percent.

Petronas may have to write off up to $800 million for work already done on the Canadian project, analysts say. [nL3N1KI3AR]

Japan Petroleum Exploration Co (Japex) <1662.T> said on Wednesday it would take a loss of about C$102 million ($82 million) due to the scrapping of the project. [nL3N1KH1DJ]

Indian Oil Corp planned to lift 1.2 million tonnes of the super-cooled fuel for 20 years from the British Columbia project for its 5 million tonne a year regasification LNG plant at Ennore in eastern India. Indian Oil was expecting deliveries from the western Canadian project to begin in 2020.

The company said it also expected a "slight delay" from Cameron LNG project in the United States and will see deliveries by the end of 2018.

Indian Oil will float a tender to import 2 million barrels of high sulphur U.S. crude in August. It intends to import high sulphur oil from the United States for as long as benchmark WTI prices are depressed, Finance Director A.K. Sharma said.

The company's net profit fell 45 percent in its fiscal first quarter of 2017, beating analysts' estimates, although higher inventory losses and lower refining margins weighed on profitability.

Net profit was 45.49 billion rupees ($714.83 million) in the quarter ended on June 30, compared with 82.69 billion rupees a year earlier, the country's top refiner said. (http://bit.ly/2v21dfw)

Analysts on average had expected a net profit of 30.63 billion rupees for the first quarter, Thomson Reuters data showed.

India's top refiner suffered an inventory loss - due to sudden changes in oil and refined product prices - of 40.4 billion rupees in the June quarter compared to a gain of 74.8 billion rupees a year ago, Sharma said.

The company's quarterly average gross refining margins, or profit earned on each barrel of crude processed, fell to $4.32 per barrel, compared with $9.98 per barrel in the same period last year.

IOC's shares closed 4.6 percent up and was the top percentage gainer on the broader Nifty 50 <.NSEI> index.

China sets sights on oil benchmark after years of delays - 路透新闻

{{20170711T080001.775+0000}}China sets sights on oil benchmark after years of delaysBy Chen Aizhu and Florence Tan

BEIJING/SINGAPORE, July 11 (Reuters) - China has opened more than 6,000 trading accounts for its long-awaited crude futures contract - with three-quarters coming from individual traders - as it pushes ahead with plans to compete with global pricing benchmarks.

China's oil majors and about 150 brokerages have also registered, but the strong interest by 'mom-and-pop' investors looks set to mark out China's crude futures from western counterparts, which are dominated by institutional investors.

Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), which will run China's contract, says it is finalising technical issues. The contract has faced years of delays and there is still no set date, but INE and also trading participants now say a launch this year is almost certain. [nL4N1IE3AJ][nL3N1HF3RR]

"The INE is striving to launch the crude oil futures within this year," a spokeswoman said, adding that the exchange has conducted four trials to ensure it is technically ready.

Oil futures trading volume is small during Asian hours despite the region's role as the world's top consumer. [nL8N1JO05K]

Shanghai's crude futures are aimed at giving China more clout in pricing crude in Asia and a share of the trillions of dollars in oil futures trade.

The INE hopes to attract foreign investors, and locally registered entities of JPMorgan and UBS are among those registered, although international players have raised concerns, including denomination in yuan, that may dampen early take-up.

Most oil trades are priced off two crude derivatives, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and London's Brent, traded on the Intercontinental Exchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) owned by CME Group .

Earlier attempts to establish an Asian derivative crude contract by Singapore and Tokyo foundered. The only liquid crude futures in the region is the Oman contract on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange.

RETAIL INTEREST

Successful crude derivatives would be the jewel in the crown in China's push to ramp up futures trading on products from dates to steel to open up markets and offer new avenues for investors. [nL1N1JD07H]

While Chinese banks are barred from futures trading, the new market is expected to attract interest from deep-pocketed private equity firms and funds, while state-owned oil majors, like PetroChina <601857.SS> and Sinopec <600028.SS> will provide liquidity.

PetroChina is set to register two accounts and Sinopec is setting up a trading outfit in Shanghai dedicated to the contract, said senior company sources.

Independent refiners like Shandong Chambroad Group have also joined, while retail interest is strong.

Individuals already account for 80 percent of turnover on China's $8 trillion equity markets, and day traders have whipsawed commodities from eggs to iron ore in China over the past year.

Jin Changyi, a 40-year-old former hotel owner from eastern China, who began dabbling in Brent crude oil futures last year, has opened a 500,000-yuan ($75,000) account with a Shanghai-based brokerage and plans to act as a mini-broker for friends.

"The way it's designed it won't fluctuate wildly. Compared to trading Brent, the risks are more manageable," he told Reuters.

INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS

International interest at first may be more muted.

Executives at international banks and traders who have reviewed the contract rules and specifications warn of concerns including Beijing's clamp-down on capital outflows, unusually small price limits and China's heavy handed intervention in commodity markets last year. [nL5N1F90E1]

"Everybody is staring at everybody else," said an official with a western investment bank who declined to be named due to company policy.

Reflecting a regulatory aim to stave off price volatility, the Shanghai contract has a 4 percent daily price fluctuation limit, half the limit for Chinese coking coal.

China's crude futures also do not have a mechanism to reset limits after a big price move, which means Shanghai trading could freeze while prices still move elsewhere. For WTI, for example, a $10 a barrel move activates circuit breakers to pause trade briefly until a new limit of another $10 is set.

Industry players also worry about delays in issuing rules over storage and grades for deliveries.

The INE has yet to finalize details of warehouse tanks, including locations, rules over fuel blending and price differentials between grades, all key for helping industry participants decide on whether or not to take deliveries.

The INE spokeswoman said it is working on approved crude oil delivery points, which are located in the peninsulas of Liaodong and Shandong, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta.

Local traders hope the contract will take off.

"The contract will initially track Brent and WTI markets," said a derivatives trading manager with a Chinese state oil company, who declined to be named because he is not authorised to speak to media.

"It won't be an immediate success, but we're hopeful."

UPDATE 1-Addax to pay 31 mln Sfr to settle Swiss bribery charges - 路透新闻

{{20170705T140549.281+0000}}UPDATE 1-Addax to pay 31 mln Sfr to settle Swiss bribery charges(Adds comment from Addax Petroleum)

ZURICH, July 5 (Reuters) - Addax Petroleum has agreed to pay 31 million Swiss francs ($32 million) to settle charges of suspected bribery of foreign officials, the Geneva prosecutor's office said on Wednesday.

Prosecutors for the Swiss canton of Geneva investigated the company, whose chief executive officer and legal director were also charged, over several tens of millions of dollars in payments to a company and several lawyers in Nigeria.[nL5N1H15A5]

A four-month investigation found the payments were not sufficiently documented and doubts remained on their legality, but no criminal intent was established, the Geneva prosecutor's office said in a statement.

It added that Addax acknowledged possible organisational shortcomings and had taken measures to improve internal anti-corruption procedures.

With this settlement the cases against the CEO and legal director have also been closed, a spokesman for the prosecutor said.

Addax was bought by China's state-owned Sinopec, Asia's largest oil refiner in 2009.

Addax said in an emailed statement its CEO had resumed his duties while its chief legal officer retired on June 30.

"Addax Petroleum is committed to conducting its business with the highest level of integrity, and in full compliance with applicable laws, regulations and industry standards," the company said in a statement.
