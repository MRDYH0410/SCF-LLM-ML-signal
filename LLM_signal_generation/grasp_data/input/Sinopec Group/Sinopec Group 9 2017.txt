By Julia Payne and Zandi Shabalala

LONDON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Commodities trader and miner Glencore has swooped in to replace China's Sinopec as the buyer of Chevron's South African and Botswana assets after reaching a deal with local investors.

The assets include a 100,000 barrel-per-day oil refinery in Cape Town, a lubricants plant in Durban as well as 820 petrol stations and other oil storage facilities. It also includes 220 convenience stores across South Africa and Botswana.

In its statement on Friday, Glencore said it had agreed to buy Chevron's 75 percent stake in its South African subsidiary and its Botswana interests for a combined $973 million. The remaining 25 percent stake will stay with a consortium of Black Economic Empowerment shareholders and an employee trust.

An industry source familiar with Glencore's mergers and acquisitions activities said the company was looking to bring in a partner.

A spokesman for Chevron said the company does not comment on commercial matters. Sinopec did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Glencore stepped in after local shareholders exercised pre-emption rights following delays to the Sinopec deal.

In March, Chevron announced that it had agreed the sale of its assets to China's largest refiner Sinopec <600028.SS>, <0386.HK> for nearly $1 billion. As of May, the deal had been under review by South Africa's Economic Development ministry. [nL3N1GZ3PH][nL8N1IR3QG]

Glencore was among the bidders for the stake last year along with oil major Total and rival trading house Gunvor. [nL8N1CU16Z]

END OF ERA

The stake was of keen interest to many oil traders as the retail network is one of the biggest in South Africa and it provides access to strategic storage in Saldanha Bay on the southwestern coast.

Chevron along with other oil majors have announced a flurry of downstream sales in the last few years to trim costs after global oil prices slumped in 2014.

Chevron, which has had a presence in South Africa for more than a century, announced the sale in January 2016.

Nimbler oil trading firms have snapped up the unwanted oil refineries and retail stations particularly in industrialising nations such as South Africa where young populations and a fast-growing middle class are expected to boost fuel demand. [nL5N1GN28P]

Glencore has shifted in the last year from shedding interests during the 2015-2016 commodities downturn to asset-buying since the rebound in prices. [nL5N1KM2XJ]

The deal, which will include Glencore retaining Chevron's local management team and workforce, will be funded using existing cash resources and is expected to close in mid-2018.

"Glencore intends to manage its overall oil asset portfolio to ensure that, including this transaction, net additional capital investment is limited to less than $500 million over the next 12 months," it said.

If the deal closes, this would be Glencore's first refining asset. It began expanding into downstream oil in May after setting up a retail franchise in Mexico. [nL8N1IK1R8]

Sinopec president Wang Yupu to head China's work safety body - Reuters News

{{20170920T031008.913+0000}}Sinopec president Wang Yupu to head China's work safety bodyBEIJING, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Sinopec <600028.SS> president Wang Yupu has been appointed the Communisty party chief of China's work safety administration, the state body said in a statement late on Tuesday, effectively heading up the safety watchdog.

The 61-year old oil industry veteran will lead the body as it battles to restore its image after a rash of safety accidents and the removal of two former heads within a year.

In July, the head of the work safety Yang Huanning was removed for serious "discipline" problems. His predecessor Yang Dongliang, was jailed for 15 years for graft in February, following a deadly blast in Tianjian. [nL4N1KM0M9][nL4N1G633R]

Wang spent more than 27 years with Sinopec. He was the head of Sinopec's Daqing oilfield before his promotion to the president in 2015.

China's government has pledged to improve the country's relatively lax safety standards after mishaps from factory fires to mine cave-ins have increased public concerns.

UPDATE 1-China's Unipec to ship first VLCC of diesel to Europe from Tianjin -sources - 路透新闻

By Jessica Jaganathan

SINGAPORE, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Unipec, the trading arm of China's state-owned Sinopec <600028.SS>, is shipping its first very large crude carrier (VLCC) cargo of diesel from China to Europe, two sources close to the matter said on Friday.

This is part of the company's plans to expand into Europe as China looks to new markets for its excess fuel.

China is planning to widen its adoption of "National V" fuel quality standards to include diesel used outside the automotive sector by January 2018, having introduced the standards for automotive diesel in January this year. [nB9N1EG00H]

As a result, refineries in China have been upgrading and are increasingly able to meet the higher quality standards required by many export markets.

Unipec will load the newly built vessel, Coshonour Lake, with 10 parts-per-million (ppm) diesel from its refinery in the northern port city of Tianjin, near Beijing, in the second half of September and the ship will head for the Mediterranean or northwest Europe, one of the sources said.

Unipec has shipped two Suezmax cargoes containing diesel in June and August, but this will be the first cargo matching the more stringent winter specifications that Europe requires, the source added.

A VLCC can carry about 2 million barrels of diesel while a Suezmax typically carries about 900,000 barrels of the fuel.

The company plans to load one more VLCC with diesel from the 310,000 barrels-per-day Tianjin refinery in October and may consider one more after that though plans are not firm.

"Next year Sinopec will be exporting mostly 10ppm sulphur diesel, so Europe will be a good target," the source said.

Unipec could not immediately be reached for official comment.

The Coshonour Lake is on its way to Yeosu in South Korea after leaving the Dalian shipyard on Thursday, Thomson Reuters shiptracking data showed, though it was not immediately clear why.

UPDATE 1-China's teapot plants form new club to beat rivals, but will it work? - 路透新闻

{{20170908T050819.741+0000}}UPDATE 1-China's teapot plants form new club to beat rivals, but will it work?* New alliance to have 1 mln bpd crude oil import quotas -exec

* Few details on new club's members, how alliance would operate

* State refiners raise pressure on smaller independents

* Private, province-backed operations also starting to compete

(Inserts graphic above subhead)

By Chen Aizhu

BEIJING, Sept 8 (Reuters) - A group of independent Chinese oil refiners is clubbing together to survive an onslaught by state-owned giants and the rise of private chemical giants, but industry analysts said the new alliance may find it hard to stick.

Less than two years after becoming some of China's newest crude oil importers, around 20 independent plants in the eastern industrial heartland of Shandong province plan to form a joint venture to coordinate their production, marketing, crude oil imports and investments. [nL4N1LL391]

The new alliance, to be called the Shandong Refining & Chemical Group, is to be headquartered in the provincial capital Jinan, and as envisioned will be an upgrade on a crude-buying federation set up in early 2016 by some of the same members.

The new group of "teapot" refiners aims to pool funds and resources to produce fuels and chemicals more efficiently as they battle stiff competition in an increasingly saturated market and under tightened environmental and tax scrutiny. [nL3N1HB3MP]

"We see the need to advance to the next stage as we face competition from both the national team and the provincial team. We can't afford operating like a plate of scattered sand," said Zhang Liucheng, a vice president of Shandong Dongming Petrochemical Group [SDHLYD.UL], one of the initiators of the stronger alliance.

The earlier crude-purchasing club was too loose an organization and did not have much success, Zhang said.

But while Shandong Dongming and fellow founding member Qingyuan Group are trying to build a more formal structure, including registering the new company as early as next week with a capitalisation of 50 billion yuan ($7.7 billion), there are few details such as a list of members and when they will start to commit funding.

Analysts said pooling the assets and coordinating the investments of 20 plants that have multiple private and local government owners will be a huge challenge.

"The new group shall have bigger political bargaining power ... but it will be hugely difficult to align all the various interests," said Harry Liu, of consultancy IHS Markit.

That was reflected in the comments of an executive of a teapot refiner that was a member of the crude buyers' club: "Each plant has its unique product lines and marketing strategies, and every new investment is a result of thorough market studies. How would you expect the new group to coordinate?"

The executive said his company was waiting to see a concrete action plan before agreeing to participate.

SEEKING BIGGER CLOUT

State-owned rivals Sinopec <600028.SS> and PetroChina <601857.SS> operate larger, more sophisticated plants, and have influence over government policies such as fuel export quotas, which are highly sought after as China's refined product output far exceeds demand. [nL4N1LH4J0] [nL3N1GN2JR]

Jiao Chong, managing director of Qingyuan Group, said the new venture could use its larger market presence to lobby the government.

The planned group would have a combined crude oil import quota of over 50 million tonnes a year, or 1 million barrels per day, an amount on par with smaller state companies like Sinochem [SASADA.UL] and China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC).

"We can become a stronger voice in lobbying for policies like fuel export quotas," Jiao said.

The need for the independent refiners to club together is heightened by the emergence of new rivals, such as provincial government-backed private chemical giants like Rongsheng Holding Group and Hengli Group [HLGRP.UL] that are building or planning refining complexes on China's eastern coast.

Hengli, a privately-owned chemicals producer, is building a similar-sized refining complex, industry officials said.

"New investments by the likes of Rongsheng have the integration skills and scale of production that teapots could barely rival, " said IHS' Liu.

Shandong Dongming is China's largest teapot refiner with a total operating capacity of 240,000 bpd.

China's teapot plants form new club to beat rivals, but will it work? - 路透新闻

{{20170908T045951.200+0000}}China's teapot plants form new club to beat rivals, but will it work?* New alliance to have 1 mln bpd crude oil import quotas -exec

* Few details on new club's members, how alliance would operate

* State refiners raise pressure on smaller independents

* Private, province-backed operations also starting to compete

By Chen Aizhu

BEIJING, Sept 8 (Reuters) - A group of independent Chinese oil refiners is clubbing together to survive an onslaught by state-owned giants and the rise of private chemical giants, but industry analysts said the new alliance may find it hard to stick.

Less than two years after becoming some of China's newest crude oil importers, around 20 independent plants in the eastern industrial heartland of Shandong province plan to form a joint venture to coordinate their production, marketing, crude oil imports and investments. [nL4N1LL391]

The new alliance, to be called the Shandong Refining & Chemical Group, is to be headquartered in the provincial capital Jinan, and as envisioned will be an upgrade on a crude-buying federation set up in early 2016 by some of the same members.

The new group of "teapot" refiners aims to pool funds and resources to produce fuels and chemicals more efficiently as they battle stiff competition in an increasingly saturated market and under tightened environmental and tax scrutiny. [nL3N1HB3MP]

"We see the need to advance to the next stage as we face competition from both the national team and the provincial team. We can't afford operating like a plate of scattered sand," said Zhang Liucheng, a vice president of Shandong Dongming Petrochemical Group [SDHLYD.UL], one of the initiators of the stronger alliance.

The earlier crude-purchasing club was too loose an organization and did not have much success, Zhang said.

But while Shandong Dongming and fellow founding member Qingyuan Group are trying to build a more formal structure, including registering the new company as early as next week with a capitalisation of 50 billion yuan ($7.7 billion), there are few details such as a list of members and when they will start to commit funding.

Analysts said pooling the assets and coordinating the investments of 20 plants that have multiple private and local government owners will be a huge challenge.

"The new group shall have bigger political bargaining power ... but it will be hugely difficult to align all the various interests," said Harry Liu, of consultancy IHS Markit.

That was reflected in the comments of an executive of a teapot refiner that was a member of the crude buyers' club: "Each plant has its unique product lines and marketing strategies, and every new investment is a result of thorough market studies. How would you expect the new group to coordinate?"

The executive said his company was waiting to see a concrete action plan before agreeing to participate.

SEEKING BIGGER CLOUT

State-owned rivals Sinopec <600028.SS> and PetroChina <601857.SS> operate larger, more sophisticated plants, and have influence over government policies such as fuel export quotas, which are highly sought after as China's refined product output far exceeds demand. [nL4N1LH4J0] [nL3N1GN2JR]

Jiao Chong, managing director of Qingyuan Group, said the new venture could use its larger market presence to lobby the government.

The planned group would have a combined crude oil import quota of over 50 million tonnes a year, or 1 million barrels per day, an amount on par with smaller state companies like Sinochem [SASADA.UL] and China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC).

"We can become a stronger voice in lobbying for policies like fuel export quotas," Jiao said.

RPT-Indonesia's Pertamina receives first license to export gasoil -sources - Reuters News

{{20170905T012119.039+0000}}RPT-Indonesia's Pertamina receives first license to export gasoil -sources(Repeats with no changes to text)

* Crowded retail market, lower domestic demand drives up inventory

* Licence issued 2-3 weeks ago, working on export procedures

* Pertamina still wants to focus on domestic sales

* Lobbying government to be exclusive importer of gasoil

By Jessica Jaganathan and Wilda Asmarini

SINGAPORE/JAKARTA, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Indonesia's Pertamina [PERTM.UL] has received a license from the government to export gasoil for the first time, three sources close to the matter said on Monday, although the state oil company is planning to prioritize domestic sales if possible.

Pertamina is typically an importer of gasoil, as diesel is called in most Asian markets, but inbound shipments have declined over the years as it ramped up refining output and demand from the mining sector slowed.

With other gasoil sellers - such as Royal Dutch Shell , Exxon Mobil Corp and Solaris Prima Energy - crowding into the retail market, and an increased biodiesel mandate in 2016 reducing conventional consumption, Pertamina's supply of the fuel has also outperformed demand, said Toharso, director of refineries at Pertamina, who goes by one name.

If Pertamina exports its surplus fuel, it would help ease supply tightness in Asia caused by Tropical Storm Harvey, which drove up the Asian gasoil margins to a one-and-a-half month high, traders said. [nL4N1LG30C] [nL8N1LH44K]

The company, though, is also taking steps to sell more gasoil into its domestic market by asking the government to grant it a monopoly on diesel imports, which would force the other retailers to buy from Pertamina.

The state oil company received the gasoil export license two to three weeks ago, and it is developing a standard operating procedure on how to export the cargoes, the sources said.

Still, "we will try our best to sell in the domestic market," Toto Nugroho, senior vice president at Pertamina for integrated supply chain, told Reuters.

But if market competition means storage inventories build up, "the last resort is to export," he said.

Pertamina declined to give details on possible export volumes or a timeline of shipments.

LOBBYING FOR IMPORT MONOPOLY

Pertamina supplies about 70 percent of Indonesia's gasoil needs, while private firms supply the rest, Toharso said.

Many of the private firms import their gasoil, but Pertamina is lobbying Jakarta to name it the country's exclusive importer of the fuel, a move that would alleviate the state oil company's surplus and possibly negate its need to export the fuel.

"Pertamina is encouraging the Energy Ministry to make other companies not to import gasoil and just buy it from Pertamina," said Toharso.

Indonesia's Energy Ministry did not address a Reuters query asking if it will approve Pertamina's request.

Dadan Kusdiana, a spokesman for the ministry said it will "encourage (retail) companies to purchase from Pertamina first before they import."

"Pertamina has also sent an offer letter to other (retail) companies that need gasoil," Kusdiana said.

But the prices offered by Pertamina are higher than buying from the international market, said a buyer who declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak with media.

"We can easily absorb the cargoes as long as the price is competitive," the buyer said.

Toharso said the prices were negotiable.

Nearly two-thirds of Indonesia's gasoil is used in its transport sector for commercial vehicles, which is expected to grow at 3 to 5 percent this year. The rest is used in the country's industrial and mining sectors.

Solaris Prima Energy is a subsidiary of China-owned trader Unipec Singapore, whose parent company is Asia's top refiner Sinopec Corp <600028.SS>.
