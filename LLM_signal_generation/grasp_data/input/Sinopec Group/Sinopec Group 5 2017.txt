{{20170608T091542.465+0000}}Sinopec says did not receive order to relocate Yanshan oil refinery BEIJING, June 8 (Reuters) - China's Sinopec <600028.SS> has not received a government order to relocate the Yanshan oil refinery, contradicting an earlier news report that the plant would be moved to develop the Xiongan New Area, the company said on Thursday.

Sinopec's statement followed an earlier report from business media Caixin saying Sinopec would move the Yanshan oil refinery to the district of Caofiedian. Yanshan is one of Sinopec's largest plants in northern China, capable of refining 10 million tonnes per year of crude, or about 200,000 barrels per day. [nL3N1J51A1]

Caixin said the relocation will help save water resources for Xiongan, citing Xu Kuangdi, chief adviser for the planning for the Xiongan economic zone.

Yanshan's fresh water consumption has dropped by 60 percent in the past ten years, Sinopec said in the statement. In 2016, Yanshan used 0.46 tonnes of water to refine 1 tonne of crude oil.

UPDATE 1-China's crude imports hit second highest on record in May - 路透新闻

{{20170608T053526.339+0000}}UPDATE 1-China's crude imports hit second highest on record in May* May crude imports rises to second highest on record

* China ahead of United States biggest crude buyer in May

* Domestic products oversupply adds to demand concerns

(Updates with quote and background)

BEIJING, June 8 (Reuters) - China's crude oil imports rebounded to the second highest on record in May, making China the world's top buyer for the month amid concerns over tightening crude supply to Asia and an extension of producer cuts to March next year.

China imported 37.2 million tonnes or 8.76 million barrels per day of crude oil last month, up 15 percent from a year earlier and nearly 8 percent from April, data from the General Administration of Customs showed.

Imports compared with average shipments to the United States in May of 8.12 million bpd, according to Reuters calculations based on EIA weekly data .

The robust May shipments reflected steady demand from private refiners, Li Yan, a crude oil analyst with Zibo Longzhong Information Group said.

"China's May crude imports were mainly driven by purchases from some Shandong-based independent refineries that had sent China's crude imports to record high in March. In the first five months, we are seeing a steady pace of buying from these 'teapot' refineries which reported good profit margins," Li said.

For the year to end-May, crude imports rose more than 13 percent from a year earlier to 176.3 million tonnes or 8.52 million bpd, the customs data showed.

However, private refiners are expected to tighten their intake for at least the next two months, analysts and traders said, ambushed by a rising local fuel glut. [nL4N1IQ314]

Imports by the world's second-biggest oil consumer had slipped from a peak of 9.2 million bpd in March to 8.4 million bpd in April.

China's exports of refined products rose 6 percent in May to 4.03 million tonnes as state refiners sold more abraod in a bid to counter a domestic oversupply. [nL4N1IQ314]

MEDIA-Sinopec's Yanshan refinery to move out of Beijing - Caixin - 路透新闻

{{20170608T022523.755+0000}}MEDIA-Sinopec's Yanshan refinery to move out of Beijing - Caixin-- Source link: http://bit.ly/2rXywR6

-- Sinopec's Yanshan refinery will move out of Beijing to Caofeidian in neighboring Hebei province, partly to spare water resources for Xiongan, China's new economic zone envisaged by President Xi Jinping, Caixin reported late on Wednesday citing Xu Kuangdi, chief adviser for the planning of the Xiongan economic zone.

-- Production cost of the Yanshan refinery will drop 15 percent after the move, as the refinery can use crude oil imported from abroad, Xu said. Caofeidian is a major port on the east coast.

-- The report did not give further details on how the move will actually take place.

-- The refinery produces 10 million tonnes of crude oil every year and over 800,000 tonne of ethylene per year.

-- Note: Reuters has not verified this story and does not vouch for its accuracy.

UPDATE 1-Norway, China step up energy cooperation, information exchange -minister - 路透新闻

{{20170607T114118.846+0000}}UPDATE 1-Norway, China step up energy cooperation, information exchange -minister(Adds quotes, details)

OSLO, June 7 (Reuters) - Norway and China signed an agreement on Wednesday to share information about the Nordic power market and technologies to limit carbon emissions, in a further sign of improving bilateral relations, Norway's oil minister Terje Soeviknes said.

The row over the Nobel Peace Prize award to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo in 2010, chosen by a Norwegian committee, froze relations between the two countries until last December.

Norwegian companies are also expected to sign five to six memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with Chinese partners this week, including one between Statoil and China Petroleum and Chemical Corp (Sinopec) <600028.SS>, the minister told Reuters, speaking by telephone from Beijing.

Statoil, which has an office in Beijing, already cooperates with state-owned Chinese oil companies in the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil.

Soeviknes said Chinese companies were especially interested in the Norwegian subsea technologies needed to develop petroleum resources in deep waters off China.

"I can't tell when there will be any commercial deals made, but this is a door opener for the Norwegian firms," Soeviknes said.

Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg travelled to Beijing in April to meet with China's leadership, including President Xi Jinping, accompanied by top Norwegian firms. [nL5N1H81LB]

During the visit, the two countries signed a pact to resume free-trade negotiations, marking the end of a six-year diplomatic freeze. [nL3N1HD2FK]

BASF, Sinopec to ramp up production of food preservative - 路透新闻

{{20170602T025608.153+0000}}BASF, Sinopec to ramp up production of food preservativeBEIJING, June 2 (Reuters) - China's Sinopec and German chemicals giant BASF on Thursday said they would nearly double production of food preservative propionic acid at a site in east China's Nanjing.

The companies expect to boost output of propionic acid by 30,000 tonnes to 69,000 tonnes from the first quarter of 2019 through their 50-50 joint venture, BASF-YPC Company Limited.

"The investment is to meet the increasing demand for stringent food safety in China," Mr Li Cheng Feng, Chairman of BASF-YPC, said in the statement.

China has been rocked in recent years by a series of food safety scandals such as the use of recycled "gutter oil" in restaurants and crops contaminated with heavy metals.

State-owned Sinopec, whose full name is China Petroleum and Chemical Corp, and BASF founded BASF-YPC in 2000. It produces 3 million tonnes of chemicals and polymers for the Chinese market annually, according to the statement from the two companies.

UPDATE 1-South Africa wants Sinopec to retain refinery capacity - 路透新闻

{{20170525T130258.376+0000}}UPDATE 1-South Africa wants Sinopec to retain refinery capacity(Adds quote, details)

CAPE TOWN, May 25 (Reuters) - South Africa is in talks with China's Sinopec about its takeover of Chevron Corp's Cape Town refinery as it wants to ensure its production capacity is retained and enhanced, Economic Development Minister Ebrahim Patel said on Thursday.

Sinopec will pay almost $1 billion for a 75 percent stake in Chevron Corp's South African assets and its subsidiary in Botswana to secure its first major refinery in Africa, the companies announced in March. [nL3N1GZ3PH]

"A key concern that government will raise in every major transaction like this is how to retain and expand our industrial capability and includes in this case, refinery capability," Patel told reporters before his budget vote speech in parliament.

Patel's ministry oversees competition authorities in Africa's most industrialised country.

South Africa has a history of taking its time over approving takeovers, partly because competition authorities have a public interest mandate to safeguard jobs in addition to an antitrust mandate to maintain competition.

In 2011, the regulator told U.S. retailer Wal-Mart Stores not to cut jobs for two years following its acquisition of South African retailer Massmart , delaying implementation of the $2.4 billion deal by at least two months.

Last year, Anheuser-Busch InBev said it would invest 1 billion rand ($77.3 million) to support small South African farmers as part of concessions agreed with the government to secure regulatory approval for its $100 billion-plus takeover of SABMiller.

Patel did not go into details of the Sinopec discussions, saying the deal with Chevron would still need to go for formal regulatory scrutiny. ($1 = 12.9335 rand)

BREAKINGVIEWS-Market forces fail working women in Asian hubs - 路透新闻

{{20170525T041748.010+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Market forces fail working women in Asian hubs(Refiles to remove word echo in the second paragraph and the context news. The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Lisa Jucca

HONG KONG, May 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - For women striving for a seat at the top table, Asia is a depressing place. Hong Kong and Singapore lag Western peers in terms of number of females in the boardroom. Despite the known business benefits and an ample pool of talent, there has been glacial progress in promoting the gender. It is time for local authorities to ditch market forces and embrace quotas to fix the imbalance.

Asia is one of the world's worst regions for female board representation, second only to Latin America and the Middle East, according to a new report by the Washington-based Corporate Women Directors International. Separate local studies show that women make up 12.4 percent of directors at the 50 biggest Hong Kong-listed companies and 10.8 percent for the top 108 firms listed in Singapore. This is short of the 25 percent or more mark in Western Europe, where "pink quotas" were earlier championed.

Graphic: Still a long way to go: http://tmsnrt.rs/2qRd1Ra

Change is happening too slowly despite high profile private initiatives to boost the female corporate contingent. Organisations like the 30% Club in Hong Kong mean there are fewer companies with an all-male board: technology giant Tencent <0700.HK> and PetroChina <0386.HK> <600028.SS> are amongst those still guided by a single sex. Indeed, the 50 big Hong Kong firms took eight years to add 26 female directorships despite a pool of 700,000 women graduates in the territory.

At this speed, it would take a generation to catch up with Western peers. Worse, debate in Hong Kong and Singapore currently focuses on hitting a modest 20 percent goal for female directors by 2020, with parity not on the agenda.

Countries that have adopted a more prescriptive approach, like India or Malaysia, are making progress faster. Their experience suggests a larger mandatory quota reduces the risk of a company adding a token woman to the board. A big quota also makes it more likely the opposite gender will enter strategic roles, as well as the necessary but stereotypical functions like human resources chief or legal counsel.

It is time to change tack and be bolder. The hands-off approach has not worked. Quotas, or at least the threat of them, would be a faster way to ensure companies and people in Asia's financial hubs perform to their potential.

FACTBOX-China's newest crude importers - 路透新闻

{{20170524T102743.136+0000}}FACTBOX-China's newest crude importersBEIJING, May 24 (Reuters) - China has granted Shandong-based independent oil refinery
Yuhuang Shengli a crude import quota of 1.44 million tonnes per year, the China Petroleum &
Chemical Industry Federation said on Wednesday. [nB9N1IH00Z]

China has given final and preliminary approvals to roughly 1.8 million barrels per day
(bpd) in crude oil import quotas, as part of efforts to reform the industry, boost competition
and attract private investment.

More than 20 refiners have either applied for or been granted quotas for the use of
imported crude oil so far. But amid growing concerns about domestic refining overcapacity,
China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the country's economic planner, has
stopped accepting new applications from oil refiners from May 5. [nL4N1HZ3VD]

Under rules issued in February 2015 by the NDRC, smaller refiners can gain permission to
use imported crude oil if they meet certain environmental conditions, including the closure of
old and polluting refining capacity.

Following is a list of refiners that have been granted approval from the NDRC for imported
crude oil quotas and import licenses.

Figures are in millions of tonnes per annum.

{{20170524T031304.625+0000}}UPDATE 1-China's Sinopec starts building nation's largest gas storage site(Updating with more detail)

BEIJING, May 24 (Reuters) - Sinopec <600028.SS> said on Wednesday it has started building China's largest natural gas storage and logistics centre with the capacity to store up to 10 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas in Henan province in the central part of the country.

The world's second-largest economy is investing in infrastructure from pipelines to storage tanks as Beijing prepares to switch from coal-fired boilers and heating systems across 28 of its smoggiest cities to natural gas or electricity by October. [nL2N1GF0EN]

The storage facility is expected to open in May 2018, Henan's official government newspaper the Puyang Daily reported last week.

The storage facility will be connected to pipelines and supply gas to central China, Beijing and Tianjin.

UPDATE 1-China issues 6.29 mln T fuel export quotas under general trade scheme -sources - 路透新闻

{{20170523T054051.131+0000}}UPDATE 1-China issues 6.29 mln T fuel export quotas under general trade scheme -sources(Adds total quotas issued under general trade scheme, details.)

BEIJING, May 23 (Reuters) - China has issued 6.29 million tonnes of fuel export quotas in a third batch for this year under its general trade scheme, two trading sources said on Tuesday, taking the total amount of such permits allotted so far in 2017 to 7.605 million tonnes.

The general trade permits, issued only to state oil companies, were on top of 15.7 million tonnes of quotas allotted to refiners under the processing trade category. [nL3N1HI3R0]

The latest batch of general trade quotas were granted to four state-run companies, namely, China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), Sinopec, CNOOC and Sinochem.

Sinopec won more than half of the quotas at 3.3 million tonnes, followed by CNPC at 1.7 million tonnes, Sinochem at 800,000 tonnes and CNOOC at 490,000 tonnes, according to one of the sources with knowledge of the matter.

The 6.29 million tonnes of quotas will be valid until the end-2017, with 55 percent of them going for diesel, 25 percent for gasoline, and the rest mostly kerosene, the source said.

The Ministry of Commerce did not comment on the matter.

Under the general trade category, refiners get tax refunds after exports are completed or get a tax waiver on fuel exports, a policy that Beijing granted in 2016.

Under the processing rules, refiners are exempted from import taxes on crude oil and export taxes for oil products, but have a fixed volume and time slots to export, both under the tight scrutiny of Chinese customs. [nL3N1HI3R0]
