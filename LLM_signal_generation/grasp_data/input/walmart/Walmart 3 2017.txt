Desemprego elevado mantém varejo conservador na Páscoa este ano - 路透新闻

{{20170329T201642.780+0000}}Desemprego elevado mantém varejo conservador na Páscoa este ano* Abras vê queda em vendas a partir de encomendas de varejistas

* Consumidor deve migrar para produtos de menor valor agregado

Por Paula Arend Laier

SÃO PAULO, 29 Mar (Reuters) - O desemprego elevado no Brasil sustenta uma atitude conservadora de consumidores e varejistas para o comércio relacionado à Páscoa deste ano, tradicionalmente uma das principais datas para o varejo nacional, em especial os supermercados, avaliam especialistas do setor.

"Não se pode esperar uma Páscoa fantástica (em termos de vendas)", vê o professor e coordenador do Centro de Excelência em Varejo da FGV-EAESP, Maurício Morgado, ressaltando que o principal vetor do comércio é o desemprego, que segue alto.

"Houve retomada na confiança, mas não do emprego, nem da renda, então a pessoa pode até ter a vontade, mas na hora do 'vamos ver' ela vai fazer a conta", acrescentou Morgado.

O Walmart Brasil, por exemplo, está apostando em produtos de menor valor agregado em itens como chocolates para a Páscoa, em vez dos tradicionais ovos. A rede afirmou que espera um crescimento de dois dígitos nas vendas de tabletes ante igual período do ano anterior.

A atitude da gigante varejista norte-americana no país acompanha os números de pesquisa da associação brasileira de supermercados, Abras, que mostrou alta nas encomendas de produtos como as caixas de bombons de 400 gramas e chocolates em geral (barra, tablete), mas queda em pedidos de ovos de Páscoa.

A taxa de desemprego no Brasil subiu a 12,6 por cento no trimestre encerrado em janeiro, com quase 13 milhões de pessoas sem emprego no país, segundo dados mais recentes divulgados pelo IBGE. [nL1N1G90HI]

"Vai ser melhor que 2016, mas com pé no chão", disse o assessor econômico da FecomercioSP, Guilherme Dietze, citando que o cenário macroeconômico está melhor do que no período que antecedeu a Páscoa no ano passado, com inflação e juros em baixa.

Em 2016, o feriado da Páscoa caiu em março, mês em que as vendas reais do setor supermercadista do país tiveram alta de 4,16 por cento sobre um ano antes.

Segundo Dietze, um recuperação firme do mercado de trabalho é essencial para que o varejo retome os níveis de vendas pré-crise, como os verificados em 2013 e 2014. E isso não deve ocorrer no curto prazo, prevê.

Nesse contexto, a Abras espera queda de 7,7 por cento nas vendas de produtos relacionados à Páscoa neste ano sobre um ano antes, no pior resultado esperado para a época desde 2011, afirmou o superintendente da entidade, Marcio Milan.

"As pessoas não vão deixar de comemorar, elas sempre dão um jeito...mas não imagino que exista abundância de compras", disse Morgado, da FGV.

O presidente da Sociedade Brasileira de Varejo e Consumo (SBVC), Eduardo Terra, avalia, contudo, que uma eventual fraqueza no varejo na Páscoa pode ser recuperada mais à frente, em datas como o Dia das Mães. "A partir de maio devemos ter uma melhora na economia e o início de uma recuperação de vendas no varejo", calcula.

Ele, contudo, não acredita que os supermercados precisarão dar mais descontos. "O que ocorreu este ano foi uma mudança no perfil de oferta e de produtos. Ano passado todos perderam (indústria e varejo), por isso, para este ano houve uma revisão geral para que todos possam obter um melhor desempenho."

UPDATE 1-U.S. top court rejects bid to revive $7.25 billion credit card settlement - 路透新闻

{{20170327T134937.840+0000}}UPDATE 1-U.S. top court rejects bid to revive $7.25 billion credit card settlement(Adds details of dispute, paragraphs 3-12)

By Lawrence Hurley

WASHINGTON, March 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear a bid by retailers to revive a $7.25 billion antitrust settlement they reached with Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc over claims the card networks improperly fixed credit and debit card fees.

The high court left in place a 2016 lower court decision that threw out the settlement on the basis that it was unfair to retailers that stood to receive no payments and derive no other benefits.

The brief Supreme Court order noted that Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito did not participate in consideration of whether to take up the appeal. No reason was given.

The settlement had been intended to resolve claims that merchants were overcharged on interchange fees, or "swipe fees," when shoppers used credit or debit cards, and were barred from directing customers toward cheaper means of payment.

The deal had been the largest all-cash U.S. antitrust settlement, although its value shrank to about $5.7 billion after roughly 8,000 retailers "opted out."

The New York-based 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals found that the accord was unfair to retailers that stood to receive no payments and, in the court's view, little or no benefit at all. It also decertified the case as a class action.

The circuit court's decision was a blow to the credit card industry, which hoped the settlement would end a decade of litigation brought on behalf of about 12 million retailers against Visa, MasterCard and banks that issue their cards.

Companies including Amazon.com Inc , Costco Wholesale Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc opposed the settlement and challenged it on appeal. Card issuers American Express Co and Discover Financial Services also objected to the settlement.

A federal judge in Brooklyn had approved the settlement in 2013, saying it offered significant damages and meaningful protections against future harm.

Many retailers and trade groups objected. Some said the payout should have been higher while others said the settlement would have made it too difficult to sue Visa and MasterCard.

According to the National Retail Federation trade group, retailers pay roughly $60 billion annually in swipe fees, which typically average around 2 percent.

Card-issuing banks would have funded much of the settlement. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp had estimated they were responsible for roughly one-fifth and one-tenth, respectively, of a payout.

ATUALIZA 1-Walmart suspende venda de produtos de frigoríficos interditados após Carne Fraca - 路透新闻

{{20170322T232902.414+0000}}ATUALIZA 1-Walmart suspende venda de produtos de frigoríficos interditados após Carne Fraca(Texto atualizado com mais informações da Abras)

SÃO PAULO, 22 Mar (Reuters) - O Walmart suspendeu a venda de produtos de frigoríficos interditados após o escândalo da operação Carne Fraca, da Polícia Federal, afirmou a unidade brasileira da rede de varejo norte-americana nesta quarta-feira.

A companhia afirmou que mantinha relação comercial contínua apenas com uma das três fábricas interditas após a operação, pertencente ao frigorífico Peccin.

A rede de varejo se juntou às outras grandes do setor, GPA e Carrefour , que anunciaram nesta semana medidas semelhantes de retirada de produtos de gôndolas de suas lojas e interrupção de compras dos frigoríficos interditados.

Consultado, o presidente da associação brasileira de supermercados, Abras, João Sanzovo Neto, afirmou que "se as redes estão fazendo isso elas que devem explicar, mas se houvesse produtos com problema tenho certeza que o governo e as indústrias já estariam fazendo e emitindo um recall oficial".

Sanzovo Neto afirmou que a Abras não está orientando seus membros a retirar produtos das lojas como consequência da operação Carne Fraca. "A gente (supermercadistas) tira mercadoria de circulação todo o dia por diversos motivos como vencimento, validade e outros. Isso é uma rotina nas lojas", disse o presidente da entidade.

Ele acrescentou que a Abras "não recebeu nenhuma informação do governo ou da indústria para fazer um recall de produtos. Nós confiamos na qualidade do produto, do serviço de inspeção".

Nesta quarta-feira, o ministro da Agricultura, Pecuária e Abastecimento, Blairo Maggi, afirmou que as suspeitas em torno da qualidade da carne brasileira, geradas pela operação Carne Fraca, arranharam a imagem do Brasil no exterior e podem resultar em um prejuízo de valores "estratosféricos" em perdas de exportações.

UPDATE 1-Brazil's gov't says meat industry may lose 10 pct market share - 路透新闻

{{20170322T205347.170+0000}}UPDATE 1-Brazil's gov't says meat industry may lose 10 pct market share(Updates throughout with details from minister, Walmart barring some meat products, quotes from consumer group and analyst)

By Maria Carolina Marcello and Brad Brooks

BRASILIA/SAO PAULO, March 22 (Reuters) - A police investigation into alleged unsanitary and corrupt practices has badly damaged the reputation of Brazil's meatpacking industry and could wipe more than 10 percent off its global market share, Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi said on Wednesday.

Maggi, a former state governor and a billionaire soy farmer, told a Senate Committee that his main concern was that China and Hong Kong have not yet taken a definitive stance on their bans of meat from Brazil, the world's biggest producer of beef and poultry.

China and Hong Kong are the top two importers of Brazilian meats, last year buying nearly one-third of the $14 billion worth of meat that Latin America's largest economy exported.

Maggi, speaking before a joint Senate committee, told lawmakers that if the government does not take quick action to tamp down the scandal, it could take Brazil up to five years to recoup the global market share it would lose.

The minister added that before the police investigation was made public last week, Brazil typically exported $64 million worth of meat a day, but that figure dropped to $74,000 on Tuesday.

The two-year investigation dubbed "Weak Flesh" has lodged accusations against more than 100 people, mostly health inspectors, for taking bribes and allowing the sale of rancid products, falsifying export documents, or failing to inspect meatpacking plants at all.

The probe by Brazil's federal police comes amid a sprawling three-year investigation into billions of dollars in political kickbacks paid by construction giants to win contracts with state-controlled firms, especially oil company Petrobras.

Hong Kong, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Switzerland and South Africa have all announced partial or all-out bans on Brazilian meat imports this week, following measures similar to those taken by China, the European Union, South Korea and Chile.

The industry took a domestic hit Wednesday, as Walmart Brasil said in a statement that it had suspended the sale of all products from 21 processing plants named so far by police as under investigation.

The Brazilian government had already banned exports from those 21 plants - but allowed them to continue production and sales to the domestic market, a move that has angered some watchdog groups.

"Is the health of a Brazilian consumer not worth the same as that of a foreigner?" said Sonia Amaro, head of institutional relations at the Proteste consumer protection group. "Brazilian industry has a history of this, of offering inferior or dangerous products to domestic customers while sending better goods overseas."

Maggi and other government leaders have aggressively tried to assure the public that this is not the case and that the meat supply does not pose any health risks. [nL2N1GW0KJ] [nE6N1G506F]

They say the problems uncovered by police are isolated events, that those involved will be fired, and that the investigation focuses mostly on corruption, not tainted products. [nL2N1GY0KQ]

But Rafael Alcadipani, a professor of organizational studies at the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Sao Paulo, refutes the government's argument.

He said too little is yet known about the findings of the ongoing investigation, and that corruption is possibly a worse finding than batches of rotten meat. If inspectors were paid to not do their jobs, it is impossible to know if putrid products entered the market, Alcadipani said.

"Because Brazil has the world's biggest meatpackers, those businesses have huge influence with the government, so the government will go to all lengths to protect them," he said.

"Officials are clearly trying to focus attention away from the central question, which is whether or not there is systematic corruption in the sanitary system. Only allowing the investigation to play out will answer that."

ANÁLISE-Escândalo das carnes no Brasil testa capacidade de JBS e BRF levar adiante IPOs no exterior - 路透新闻

{{20170322T202318.090+0000}}ANÁLISE-Escândalo das carnes no Brasil testa capacidade de JBS e BRF levar adiante IPOs no exteriorPor Guillermo Parra-Bernal e Paula Arend Laier

SÃO PAULO, 22 Mar (Reuters) - As duas maiores processadoras de alimentos do Brasil estão se esforçando para restaurar a confiança na qualidade de seus controles internos, enquanto seguem com planos de listar unidades no exterior apesar do escândalo sobre suposta propina a fiscais sanitários, que levou à suspensão de exportações de carnes do país para vários mercados.

Na última sexta-feira, a Polícia Federal citou como envolvidas na operação unidades de JBS , maior processadora de carne bovina do mundo, e da BRF , maior exportadora mundial de carne de frango.

O escândalo veio à tona poucas semanas antes de JBS e BRF lançarem ofertas públicas iniciais de suas unidades com sede no exterior JBS Foods International e One Foods Holdings. As ofertas, que podem movimentar conjuntamente até 2,5 bilhões de dólares, miram acelerar os planos de expansão global das empresas.

Embora JBS e BRF tenham negado as acusações, a imagem da indústria brasileira de carne sofreu um duro golpe. As exportações de carne do país caíram de 63 milhões de dólares em média por dia antes do escândalo para 74 mil na terça-feira.

A China, maior consumidor da carne brasileira, suspendeu todos os embarques de carne do país no fim de semana, com Hong Kong seguindo o movimento na terça-feira e a União Europeia suspendendo as compras de quatro instalações no Brasil. O Japão suspendeu importações de frango das fábricas citadas.

No Brasil, as três principais redes de supermercados do país, GPA , Carrefour e Walmart , anunciaram medidas que incluem retirada de produtos de suas lojas e bloqueio de novas compras.

Quatro pessoas diretamente envolvidas em ambas as operações de JBS e BRF disseram que as empresas iriam avançar com os IPOs, enquanto buscavam reforçar a confiança dos investidores com uma campanha argumentando que a "Operação Carne Fraca" descreveu fatos equivocados sobre seus padrões de segurança.

A JBS não tem nenhuma intenção adiar o IPO de pelo menos 1 bilhão de dólares da JBS Foods em Nova York, que espera finalizar em maio ou junho, disse uma das fontes.

A BRF continua a analisar se a venda de uma participação na One Foods será através de um IPO em Londres ou para um grupo de investidores em uma colocação privada, na qual espera levantar 1,5 bilhão de dólares, disse outra fonte.

Nenhuma das empresas sentiu ainda alguma repercussão negativa dos potenciais investidores, disseram as fontes. Representantes da JBS e da BRF não comentaram o assunto.

BUSCANDO CLAREZA

O escândalo reduziu em 2,2 bilhões de dólares o valor e mercado de JBS e BRF desde sexta-feira, segundo dados da Thomson Reuters.

De acordo com dois gestores de recursos em Nova York e três gestores em Londres, investidores devem buscar mais esclarecimento sobre os fatos em torno da operação Carne Fraca.

"As perspectivas futuras para um negócio como este, em qualquer lugar, não serão claras até que as partes envolvidas removam a pressão existente na questão, seja suspensões ou supervisão mais rigorosa", disse Nick Field, que ajuda a administrar 26 bilhões de dólares em mercados emergentes para a Schroeder Investment Management em Londres. Field, como os outros gestores de fundos, não quis dizer se sua empresa estava pensando em participar dos IPOs.

As duas empresas e os grupos lançaram ações de relações públicas para reparar a imagem do setor. A BRF tem negado as alegações da Polícia Federal de que misturou papelão em seus produtos e disse que não há evidências de que vendeu carne estragada. A JBS disse que todas as unidades exportadoras no Brasil seguem rigorosos procedimentos internacionais.

A mensagem de que o Brasil é sério sobre a segurança de alimentos também será transmitida aos investidores. Executivos da JBS planejam reuniões com os bancos que trabalham no IPO da JBS Foods esta semana, permitindo-lhes verificar as informações sobre as investigações com terceiros, disse uma das fontes.

REVÉS

Embora BRF seja mais exposta entre as duas gigantes de alimentos ao mercado brasileiro - que representa 55 por cento das vendas da companhia e com a maior parte dos embarques de aves da empresa saindo do país -, nenhuma das fábricas de processamento de alimentos halal com sede no Brasil foi suspensa como consequência da operação Carne Fraca, disse uma das fontes.

No entanto, alguns investidores e analistas como Ronaldo Kasinsky, do Santander Investment Securities, permanecem cautelosos e dizem que a investigação em andamento pode representar um verdadeiro retrocesso para ambas as ofertas.

Além de um escrutínio regulatório mais rigoroso, os investidores poderiam se preocupar quanto ao valor da operação, exigir uma análise mais aprofundada das normas de segurança ou ampliar os procedimentos de due diligence.

Outros, como Carlos Laboy, do HSBC Securities, estão confiantes que as operações vão avançar.

O IPO da JBS Foods, que vende produtos para 350 mil clientes no mundo, poderia ajudar sua controladora JBS a se transformar em um participante global do setor de alimentos de alto valor.

Para a BRF, o negócio One Foods deve impulsionar a expansão do grupo nas nações asiáticas muçulmanas. A One Foods já controla 45 por cento dos mercado das aves in natura halal na Arábia Saudita, Emirados Árabes Unidos, Kuweit, Qatar e Omã.

MÄRKTE 14-US-Einzelhändler Sears im Minus - Zweifel am Überleben - 路透新闻

{{20170322T163914.553+0000}}MÄRKTE 14-US-Einzelhändler Sears im Minus - Zweifel am ÜberlebenFrankfurt, 22. Mrz (Reuters) - Aus Furcht vor einer Pleite haben Anleger Aktien von Sears am Mittwoch in hohem Bogen aus ihren Depots geworfen. Die Papiere des US-Einzelhändlers stürzten an der Wall Street um bis zu 16,5 Prozent ab und steuerten auf den größten Tagesverlust seit viereinhalb Jahren zu.

Das Unternehmen hatte in seinem am Dienstagabend veröffentlichten Geschäftsbericht eingeräumt, dass "substanzieller Zweifel an der Fähigkeit zur Weiterführung des Geschäfts" besteht. Er gehe zwar nicht davon aus, dass Sears 2017 Insolvenz anmelden wird, sagte Chad Brand, Chef des Vermögensverwalters Peridot, und Halter von Anleihen der Kaufhauskette. "Allerdings sind die kommenden zwölf Monate entscheidender als in vergangenen Jahren, da sie sich keine Fehler erlauben dürfen."

Seit 2012 hat Sears Verluste von 10,54 Milliarden Dollar angehäuft. Der Umsatz fiel im gleichen Zeitraum um knapp die Hälfte auf 22,1 Milliarden Dollar. "Bei dem harten Wettbewerb im Einzelhandel heutzutage hat Sears nicht die Ressourcen für die notwendigen Investitionen im Kampf gegen Amazon und Discounter", sagte Ken Perkins, Chef des Branchendienstes Retail Metrics.

UPDATE 1-Walmart announces plan to invest $800 million in Chile - 路透新闻

{{20170322T161008.636+0000}}UPDATE 1-Walmart announces plan to invest $800 million in Chile(New throughout, adds details about plan, more comments from executive)

SANTIAGO, March 22 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc's Chilean unit will invest $800 million in the country over the next three years and open 55 to 60 new supermarkets, the company said on Wednesday, a significant outlay at a time of slow economic growth.

As part of the plan, the retail and supermarket chain will also remodel over 50 stores, add more than 5,000 jobs, and further develop a large distribution center near the capital city of Santiago.

"We are confident in the future potential of the country, and we are convinced that spaces exist to continue expanding our low-cost model," Walmart Chile general manager Horacio Barbeito said in a statement.

"Both in the high and low moments of the economic cycle, consumers are always interested in using their budget efficiently, and this will continue being our focus."

Chile's economy has struggled in recent years amid low prices for key export copper and lagging business confidence. Gross domestic product in the fourth quarter contracted 0.4 percent from the prior quarter, worse than forecast, and first-quarter 2017 figures will be affected by a work stoppage at Chile's largest mine.[nL2N1GX0C6][nL2N1GK0JA]

In its statement, Wal-Mart said the expansion plan will focus on medium-sized stores, such as the company's Express de Lider and Super Bodega aCuenta formats.

The distribution center is already under construction and will require 2,000 employees and $180 million in investment, the company added.

The company said it will also seek to improve its online department. Online retail has been on the rise in parts of Latin America in recent years, and other Chilean retailers such as Falabella and Cencosud have invested significant sums in this area.

UPDATE 4-Sears warns of 'going concern' doubts - 路透新闻

{{20170322T123339.761+0000}}UPDATE 4-Sears warns of 'going concern' doubts* Lost more than $2 bln last year

* Sale of Craftsman brand to help satisfy capital needs this year

* Limits on further assets it can sell

(Adds shares, removes extraneous text)

By Ankit Ajmera and Nathan Layne

March 21 (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp , once the largest U.S. retailer, warned on Tuesday about its ability to continue as a going concern after years of losses and declining sales.

"Our historical operating results indicate substantial doubt exists related to the company's ability to continue as a going concern," Sears said in its annual report for the fiscal year ended Jan. 28. (http://bit.ly/2mRUcce)

The company said an inability to generate additional liquidity might limit its access to new merchandise or its ability to procure services. Continued operating losses also could restrict access to new funds under its domestic credit agreement, according to the filing.

The warning comes less than six weeks after the company announced what it called the "next phase of its strategic transformation," in which it hoped this year to reduce costs by $1 billion and cut its debt and pension obligations by at least $1.5 billion. [nL4N1FV483]

Sears shares were down 17.6 percent in premarket trading on Wednesday.

The company is also considering selling some of its businesses, such as the Kenmore appliances and DieHard car battery brands. [nL4N1FV483]

The Sears catalog was an emblem of the post-World War II consumer boom in the United States but the company was unable to adjust to the changing retail landscape and rising competition from Wal-Mart Stores , Target Corp and others.

The company lost $2.22 billion in the year ended Jan. 28. Since 2013 it has accumulated $7.4 billion in losses and seen revenue fall 44 percent to $22.1 billion.

During that time, Sears cut the number of its U.S. stores by nearly a third, reduced holdings in Sears Canada, and spun off the Lands' End clothing chain.

Its total liabilities stand at $13.19 billion.

In recent years, Sears has placed some of its stores into a real estate investment trust (REIT), sold its Craftsman line of tools, and repeatedly raised debt from billionaire Chief Executive Edward Lampert's hedge fund. [nL4N1FV483]

Lampert owned nearly 10 percent of the REIT that paid Sears $2.6 billion in 2015 for stores that it purchased, many of which were then leased back to the retailer.

The announcement of Sears' potential demise is a blow to Lampert, a hedge fund investor who took control of Sears after merging it with Kmart, which he controlled, in 2004.

He soon published a 15-page manifesto, in which he stated that conventional measures of retail success, such as same-store sales, were no longer relevant. Sears would regain its health by closing struggling stores and focusing instead on profitable sales, he wrote.

Sears last turned an annual profit in 2011.

Sears said on Tuesday actions taken during the year to boost liquidity, including the $900 million sale of the Craftsman tool brand to power tool maker Stanley Black & Decker Inc early this year, could satisfy its capital needs for the current fiscal year.

But the filing also makes clear that additional asset sales could prove problematic.

As part of the Craftsman sale, Sears Holdings reached an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. That puts a claim on some Sears' assets in an effort to protect pensions of retired employees.

The agreement "contains certain limitations on our ability to sell assets, which could impact our ability to complete asset sale transactions or our ability to use proceeds from those sales to fund our operations," the company said.

Already, the pension board agreement requires Sears to make a $250 million cash payment to its pension plan by March of 2020, and the pension board has a 15-year lien on revenue owed to Sears from future sales of Craftsman products.

REFILE-UPDATE 1-Chinese supermarkets pull Brazil meat from shelves as food safety fears grow - 路透新闻

* No.1 hypermarket chain Sun Art removes Brazil beef from stores

* Wal-Mart, Metro arms also pull Brazil products -sources

By Dominique Patton

BEIJING, March 22 (Reuters) - Some of China's largest food suppliers have pulled Brazilian beef and poultry from their shelves in the first concrete sign that a deepening scandal over Brazil's meat processing industry is hitting business in its top export market.

The moves by Sun Art Retail Group <6808.HK>, China's biggest hypermarket chain, and the Chinese arms of global retail giants Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Metro AG come days after China temporarily suspended Brazilian meat imports.

Safety fears over Brazilian meat have grown since police accused inspectors in the world's biggest exporter of beef and poultry of taking bribes to allow sales of rotten and salmonella-tainted meats. [nL2N1GX0OP]

A spokeswoman for Sun Art Retail, which operates 400 Chinese hypermarkets, said on Wednesday the chain had removed beef supplied by top Brazilian exporters BRF SA and JBS SA from its shelves from Monday. Brazilian beef accounts for less than 10 percent of Sun Art's beef supply, she said.

Wal-Mart has also removed Brazilian meat products from its stores, a person familiar with the matter said. He declined to be quoted because of the sensitivity of the matter.

Germany's Metro has withdrawn Brazilian chicken legs and wings from its Chinese stores, said a manager, who declined to be named as he was not allowed to speak to media. The retailer, with 84 stores in China, does not sell Brazilian beef.

JD.com, one of China's biggest online retailers, said in an emailed statement it had also removed all listings for imported Brazilian meat and is reviewing orders in process.

While Brazilian officials sought late on Tuesday to reassure consumers that the investigation had revealed only isolated incidents of sanitary problems, the reaction by Chinese retailers suggests that the probe could have far-reaching repercussions for the world's top meat exporter. [nL2N1GY0KQ]

Chinese consumers appeared largely unconcerned or unaware of the scandal in Brazil, with few people commenting on the issue on the country's vibrant social media networks.

But the country has been hit by its own safety scandals in the past, making retailers sensitive to any potential risks.

"We removed the product already on March 20," said Sun Art's spokeswoman, noting it was ahead of the Chinese government's first official comment on the issue. [nL3N1GY3GO]

Brazil is the top supplier of beef to China, accounting for about 31 percent of its imports in the first half of last year. Much of it is used in canteens and foodservice and branded Brazilian beef is less prominent in supermarkets than Australian beef.

Importers are expected to wait a few more days before seeking out alternative supplies, which will likely be more costly than Brazil's.

"It's a 45-day lead-time to get any product here. What if they lift the ban by the end of the week?" said an industry source who declined to be identified.

Hong Kong, the second-biggest buyer of Brazilian meat last year, has also issued a ban on imports, following similar steps by Japan, Canada, Mexico and Switzerland.

Major Hong Kong supermarket chain PARKnSHOP said it had removed Brazilian pork, beef and chicken from shelves.

"To cater for the needs of customers, we will increase the supply of meat and poultry products from other countries," it said in a statement, without elaborating.

Sears said on Tuesday actions taken during the year to boost liquidity, including the $900 million sale of the Craftsman tool brand to power tool maker Stanley Black & Decker Inc early this year, could satisfy its capital needs for the current fiscal year.

But the filing also makes clear that additional asset sales could prove problematic.

As part of the Craftsman sale, Sears Holdings reached an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. That puts a claim on some Sears' assets in an effort to protect pensions of retired employees.

The agreement "contains certain limitations on our ability to sell assets, which could impact our ability to complete asset sale transactions or our ability to use proceeds from those sales to fund our operations," the company said.

Already, the pension board agreement requires Sears to make a $250 million cash payment to its pension plan by March of 2020, and the pension board has a 15-year lien on revenue owed to Sears from future sales of Craftsman products.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Albertsons' shopping drives away grocery bargains - 路透新闻

{{20170321T161938.367+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Albertsons' shopping drives away grocery bargains(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Lauren Silva Laughlin

DALLAS, March 21 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Albertsons is hitting the shopping aisles again. This time, the supermarket chain owned by private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management is eying a purchase of $3 billion Sprouts Farmers Market , according to Bloomberg. Adding an organic-food purveyor to its cart makes sense, as does bulking up generally. But as the fight for food shoppers increases, so do prices for their stores – and pressures on margins.

The grocery business is fiercely competitive. Online merchants such as FreshDirect and Instacart are luring traffic away from brick-and-mortar stores while discounters are putting ever more pressure on major food chains. Germany's Lidl will open its first U.S. stores this summer, using the same low-price, private-label strategy that compatriot Aldi has used to great effect. Even giant Wal-Mart is feeling the pain, with its global operating margin declining to 4.7 percent in the year to January from 5.9 percent four years earlier.

Albertsons has responded with consolidation. Cerberus, along with partners, bought 655 struggling Albertsons stores in 2006 and acquired the remaining 877 stores in 2013. Two years later Albertsons paid $9.4 billion for Safeway. The company's U.S. market share has surged to 5.4 percent from just 0.4 percent in 2012, making it the country's third-largest grocery operator behind Wal-Mart and Kroger , according to Euromonitor.

The Sprouts deal would add another important ingredient: organic specialties. Shopping for fresh, unrefined foods is expected to grow at a double-digit pace through 2021, according to TechSci Research. A deal would enable Albertsons to expand its organic lines and exploit Sprouts' private-label offerings.

Those benefits won't come cheap, though. Sprouts' stock price has already risen more than 20 percent since March 10. If Cerberus were to offer an additional 10 percent premium, it would be paying more than 17 times trailing operating income, well in excess of the 12 times multiple private-equity firm Apollo Global Management paid to buy another specialty grocer, Fresh Market, just last year.

The target also offers less alluring growth prospects. Traditional grocery stores have beefed up their organic offerings, making customers less likely to wander into specialty markets like Sprouts. The company's annual revenue growth has slowed to 13 percent last year from 36 percent in 2013.

Albertsons probably won't be the last grocer to open up its pocketbook. But if supermarkets want to acquire shoppers, they shouldn't be expecting any discounts.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Albertsons has held preliminary merger talks with Sprouts Farmers Market, according to a Bloomberg report on March 19 citing people familiar with the situation. The company, which is backed by private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, filed for an initial public offering in 2015 but has not listed shares. Cerberus first invested in Albertsons in 2006. In 2015, the company paid $9.4 billion for rival supermarket chain Safeway.

Wal-Mart to launch investment arm in e-commerce push - 路透新闻

{{20170320T234147.397+0000}}Wal-Mart to launch investment arm in e-commerce pushBy Nandita Bose

March 20 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc , the world's largest retailer, will launch its first investment arm to expand its e-commerce business in partnership with retail start-ups, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, the company said on Monday.

The plan is being spearheaded by Marc Lore, Wal-Mart's e-commerce chief, who joined the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company from retail upstart Jet.com, which it acquired for more than $3 billion in August. [nL4N1AP42N][nL2N1BV1MP]

Since then, Wal-Mart has acquired three small web retailers to add urban and millennial shoppers.

The venture, called Store No. 8, will work with startups that specialize in areas that include robotics, virtual and augmented reality, machine learning and artificial intelligence, Lore said at Shoptalk, a retail conference in New York. It will be based in California's Silicon Valley, he added.

Wal-Mart will keep the startups separate from the broader organization so that they will not affect the retailer's bottom line in the near term, Seth Beal, senior vice-president, incubation and strategic partnerships, said in an interview.

He declined to give a timeframe for the launch.

IBM launches enterprise-ready blockchain service - 路透新闻

{{20170320T040101.714+0000}}IBM launches enterprise-ready blockchain serviceBy Anna Irrera

NEW YORK, March 20 (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp has launched a service that will allow businesses to build applications on its cloud using blockchain code from the Hyperledger Project, the cross-industry group led by the Linux Foundation.

The U.S. technology company said on Monday its new product called IBM Blockchain was the first service for developers to build enterprise-grade technology using Hyperledger Fabric, the first code set to be released by the open source group. [L2N1GG0WL]

The Fabric blockchain can process more than 1,000 transactions per second and has the necessary features to be used by large enterprises to build their applications, IBM said.

It added it was working with technology company SecureKey Technologies and a group of Canadian banks to build a digital identity network using its new blockchain services.

The network, set for launch later this year, is aimed at making it easier for consumers to prove their identities when accessing services such as new bank accounts, driver's licenses or utilities. Banks involved include Bank of Montreal , Royal Bank of Canada , Bank of Nova Scotia , Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Toronto-Dominion Bank .

Blockchain, which emerged as the system running cryptocurrency bitcoin, is a digital shared record of transactions that is maintained by a network of computers on the internet, without the need of a centralized authority.

Big businesses, including many of the world's largest banks, have been increasing their investment in the technology in hopes it can help them reduce the complexity and costs of some of their most burdensome processes, such as the settlement of securities or international payments.

Technology companies and professional services firms have also been ramping up their investment in blockchain, as they race to capture the nascent market.

IBM has been one of the most aggressive large technology companies on blockchain and has several large clients developing applications with the technology, including Northern Trust Corp , Wal-Mart Stores Inc and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation.

IBM said it had also tested a blockchain-based asset management platform for carbon assets with Chinese company Energy-Blockchain Labs. The companies aim to release the platform, built using the new IBM Blockchain, later this year.

UPDATE 2-Albertsons held preliminary merger talks with Sprouts -Bloomberg - Reuters News

{{20170320T004835.090+0000}}UPDATE 2-Albertsons held preliminary merger talks with Sprouts -Bloomberg(Adds grocery industry background in graphs 5-8)

By Lawrence Delevingne and Lauren Hirsch

NEW YORK, March 19 (Reuters) - Grocery business Albertsons Cos held preliminary talks to merge with Sprouts Farmers Market Inc , Bloomberg reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the situation.

Bloomberg said the early stage discussions took place in recent weeks and involved a plan to take Sprouts private. Doing so would add the natural and organic foods-focused business to the Albertsons suite of supermarket brands, which includes Safeway, Vons and Shaw's.

Albertsons is backed by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management. Representatives for Albertsons and Sprouts did not immediately respond to requests for comment, while a spokeswoman for Cerberus declined to comment.

Shares of Sprouts spiked to a four-month high on Thursday and Friday amid a surge in stock options trading. [nL2N1GU1SG]

SUPERMARKET CONSOLIDATION

An acquisition of Sprouts would underscore the consolidation sweeping the U.S. grocery industry, as regional chains struggle to compete against online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc , big box stores such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc , and discount chains such as ALDI Inc. [nL1N1DU2E5]

Albertsons is one of the two most active industry acquirers along with The Kroger Co. . A planned initial public offering for Albertsons' has been delayed since October 2015. At the same time, Krogers stock is up more than 140 percent over the last five years despite falling 23 percent over the previous 12 months.

Sprouts is among the niche retailers such as Fresh Market Inc and Whole Foods Market Inc facing pressure from Albertsons and Kroger, who now sell some of the same specialty and organic products at lower prices.

Fresh Market was acquired by another private equity firm, Apollo Global Management LLC , for about $1.36 billion in cash in 2016.

ATUALIZA 1-ANÁLISE-Escândalo da carne impacta indústria no Brasil e ameaça exportações - 路透新闻

{{20170317T234002.192+0000}}ATUALIZA 1-ANÁLISE-Escândalo da carne impacta indústria no Brasil e ameaça exportações(Acrescenta comentários de supermercadistas e da AEB) Por Alberto Alerigi Jr., Roberto Samora e Paula Arend Laier

SÃO PAULO, 17 Mar (Reuters) - O status do Brasil como exportador de produtos de carne de qualidade passou a ser ameaçado nesta sexta-feira depois que a Polícia Federal revelou um esquema de propina que identificou casos que permitiram a comercialização de alimentos estragados e maquiados por insumos como papelão e produtos químicos.

A operação Carne Fraca, a maior já realizada pela Polícia Federal, identificou uma organização criminosa liderada por fiscais agropecuários federais e cerca de 40 empresas. A PF citou entre as empresas as gigantes JBS e BRF e outras como Peccin Agro Industrial.

"Nunca vimos nada parecido antes no setor. Em termos de escândalo, nunca aconteceu nada semelhante. É a primeira vez que se identifica e se dá nome às pessoas. Isso é horripilante", disse Alex Lopes da Silva, analista especializado no mercado pecuário da Scot Consultoria.

"É uma denúncia bastante grave. Tem órgãos federais de fiscalização sendo corrompidos, isso abre muita possibilidade para o Brasil sofrer algum tipo de impacto... Mancha todo um sistema que o Brasil está construindo há anos de que tem um processo de produto bem feito", afirmou Silva.

O Brasil começou a exportar carne para a Europa no início dos anos 2000 e apenas no ano passado conseguiu aprovação para embarcar carne bovina in natura aos Estados Unidos, um dos mercados mais exigentes do mundo em termos de qualidade de produtos alimentícios.

As exportações de carnes do Brasil (bovina, suína e de frango) subiram de cerca de 2 bilhões de dólares em 2000 para aproximadamente 14 bilhões de dólares no ano passado.

O analista de pecuária do Centro de Estudos Avançados em Economia Aplicada (Cepea), da Esalq/USP, Sérgio De Zen, foi na mesma linha, apostando que o escândalo poderá ser aproveitado para imposição de dificuldades às exportações brasileiras de carne.

"Vai ter países aproveitando? Vai. Mas o impacto disso não vai ser tão grande como seria se eles descobrissem lá fora o problema. Quem está apontando o problema é o Brasil", disse De Zen.

Na avaliação de De Zen, eventuais embargos externos à carne brasileira deverão ser por curto espaço de tempo. Ele lembrou que importantes importadores, como europeus e russos, mandam missões próprias para fiscalizar o sistema sanitário do Brasil, o que faz com que grandes unidades exportadoras eventualmente fiquem menos sujeitas a sofrer embargos.

"O importador mais exigente geralmente manda fiscalização aqui, ele não aceita qualquer coisa, ele fiscaliza antes de começar a importação, é um processo diferenciado", acrescentou, defendendo uma reformulação do sistema de fiscalização sanitária do Brasil e a criação de uma agência independente de fiscalização.

Além do impacto para o setor carnes, a operação da PF poderá ter repercussões nos preços dos grãos, afirmou o presidente da AEB, associação que reúne os exportadores brasileiros, José Augusto Castro.

Segundo ele, produtos como milho e soja, com forte presença na pauta exportadora brasileira, devem ter uma redução de preços no mercado global, na avaliação do dirigente.

"Se o Brasil reduzir a quantidade (de carne) exportada, principalmente o frango que consome muita ração, vamos deixar de transformar soja e milho em farelo; vai ter que colocar isso no mercado externo e com oferta maior isso pode derrubar o preço (dos grãos)".

As ações de JBS e BRF despencaram nesta sexta-feira e lideraram as perdas do Ibovespa <.BVSP>. A JBS afundou 10,59 por cento, maior queda desde outubro de 2016. BRF desabou 7,25 por cento, pior desempenho desde fevereiro. Também do setor, Marfrig ; e Minerva , caíram cerca de 2 por cento cada.

A BRF informou em comunicado ao mercado que "cumpre as normas e regulamentos referentes à produção e comercialização de seus produtos, possui rigorosos processos e controles e não compactua com práticas ilícitas. A BRF assegura a qualidade e a segurança de seus produtos e garante que não há nenhum risco para seus consumidores, seja no Brasil ou nos mais de 150 países em que atua".

Já a JBS afirmou também em comunicado divulgado mais cedo que a empresa e suas subsidiárias "atuam em absoluto cumprimento de todas as normas regulatórias em relação à produção e à comercialização de alimentos no país e no exterior e apoia as ações que visam punir o descumprimento de tais normas". A empresa divulgou um novo comunicado na noite desta sexta-feira, afirmando que "nenhuma fábrica da JBS foi interditada (...) A JBS não compactua com desvios de conduta e tomará todas as medidas cabíveis".

Ligações feitas pela Reuters à Peccin não foram atendidas.

NO BRASIL

Internamente, as empresas denunciadas devem sofrer impactos importantes sobre suas marcas, com a confiança dos consumidores sendo abalada pela divulgação de gravações em que representantes de frigoríficos conversam sobre inclusão de carne de cabeça de porco em linguiças.

"No segmento alimentar, confiança é algo que vem no inconsciente desde pequeno, dentro da família (...) Se tem desconfiança tão grande com comida, e nessas marcas o problema aparentemente existe, imagina o resgate de confiança que isso não vai demandar", afirmou o professor do curso de Publicidade e Propaganda da Fundação Armando Alvares Penteado (FAAP), Sérgio Silva, especializado em marcas.

Segundo ele, é difícil precisar o tamanho do impacto financeiro para as empresas do setor gerado pelo escândalo, "mas vai ser gigante".

"O varejista vai se preocupar, tem risco de o varejista querer tirar tudo o que é da marca e fazer o fabricante recomprar. Além dos supermercados, há ainda as cadeias de fast food, restaurantes, tem impacto na cadeia inteira", disse Silva, lembrando de casos como os que atingiram a marca de leite de soja AdeS, hoje da Coca-Cola Femsa , em 2013. Na ocasião, lotes tiveram de ser retirados do mercado, depois que a empresa identificou na bebida produto de limpeza que podia causar queimaduras.

Para Luli Radfahrer, professor-doutor da ECA-USP e ex-diretor de criação de várias grandes agências de publicidade, como AlmapBBDO, a melhor solução para as empresas envolvidas no escândalo seria mudar suas marcas.

"Os eventos são muito gráficos... sujeito que ouviu uma vez na vida, nunca mais vai esquecer e sempre vai associar", afirmou Radfahe, acrescentando que não há propaganda que salve o impacto sobre os produtos.

Assim, como Silva, da FAAP, Radfahrer acredita que há riscos de distribuidores virem a público para dizerem que não aceitam as marcas envolvidas no escândalo em suas prateleiras.

A rede de varejo GPA afirmou em comunicado que os lotes de produtos in natura de fornecedores recebidos em suas centrais de distribuição passam por processos internos próprios de auditoria e que "qualquer tipo de irregularidade, se identificada, resulta na devolução imediata do lote ao fornecedor".

Já o Carrefour comentou que a rede já exigiu esclarecimento aos fabricantes envolvidos nas denúncias e que possui controle rigoroso para seleção e monitoramento de seus fornecedores. O Walmart afirmou que confia plenamente em seus procedimentos internos de segurança dos alimentos e que está cobrando explicações dos fornecedores.

Segundo o secretário-executivo do Ministério da Agricultura, Pecuária e Abastecimento, Eumar Novacki, foram interditadas as unidades da BRF em Mineiros (GO) e da Peccin em Jaraguá do Sul (SC) e Curitiba.

Wal-Mart supplier recalls U.S. frozen pizzas over possible Listeria - Reuters Health eLine

CHICAGO (Reuters) - A Wal-Mart Stores Inc supplier has recalled frozen pizzas available in 11 U.S. states due to concerns about possible Listeria contamination, according to the retailer and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

About 6,700 pizzas sold under Wal-Mart's Marketside brand were affected by the recall, a representative of the supplier said on Thursday.

RBR Meat Company recalled about 21,220 pounds of Marketside Extra Large Supreme Pizza that were shipped to retail distribution centers in California, Nevada, Utah and Washington, the USDA said on Wednesday. The product carries the code 20547.

Wal-Mart and the USDA said they were unaware of illnesses linked to the pizzas.

The retailer said it started removing the products from its shelves and inventory as soon as it received notice of the recall from Rose and Shore, a food company affiliated with Vernon, California-based RBR.

The pizzas were available in California, Colorado, Nevada, Washington state, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Wyoming, Alaska and Hawaii, Wal-Mart said. Sam's Club was not affected.

People should not eat the pizzas, according to the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service. It said RBR discovered the possible Listeria contamination during routine sampling.

Listeriosis is a serious illness caused by eating food contaminated with Listeria bacteria, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The infection is most likely to sicken pregnant women and babies, adults older than 65, and people with weakened immune systems.

An estimated 1,600 people contract listeriosis each year and about 260 die, according to the CDC.

In an unrelated case, the CDC is investigating a multistate outbreak of listeriosis linked to the consumption of soft raw milk cheese made by Vulto Creamery that has led to two deaths.Copyright (c) 2017 Thomson Reuters

UPDATE 2-UK's Sainsbury's warns higher cost prices making life harder - 路透新闻

{{20170316T115143.056+0000}}UPDATE 2-UK's Sainsbury's warns higher cost prices making life harder* Currency and commodity price moves impacting

* Says inflation has returned to business

* Q4 supermarket underlying sales fall 0.5 pct

* Argos like-for-like sales up 4.3 pct

(Adds comments by CEO, analyst; share price reaction)

By James Davey

LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - Sainsbury's , Britain's second biggest retailer, cautioned that cost price pressures would weigh on its business this year as it reported a small decline in underlying sales over the last three months.

An almost 18 percent devaluation of the pound versus the U.S. dollar and a 12 percent fall against the euro since last June's Brexit vote, which has driven up import costs, combined with commodity price fluctuations, is making life harder for Britain's supermarkets.

"When we talk about uncertainty those factors weigh very heavily on underlying cost prices and therefore retail prices," Sainsbury's Chief Executive Mike Coupe told reporters on Thursday.

"We would acknowledge that we've gone from an environment which has been deflationary for two and a half years to being inflationary," he said.

While a return to food price inflation, in moderation, could be welcomed by investors in grocery stocks as it can boost sales and profit margins, the flip side is that rising inflation could begin to squeeze consumers' purchasing power.

Coupe said Sainsbury's, which last year expanded in areas such as electrical goods when it bought Argos-owner Home Retail for 1.1 billion pounds ($1.4 billion), had done a lot to mitigate cost price pressures within its supply chains and would continue to cut costs to try to limit price rises for shoppers.

Coupe, who did not give any specific margin or sales targets, believes Sainsbury's is well placed to handle the pressures, pointing to growth in the areas where it has heavily invested, namely at Argos and in clothing, convenience stores and online.

Morrisons , the smallest of Britain's "big four" supermarket groups and clear market leader Tesco have been setting the recent pace in sales growth terms. [nL5N1GM1L6] [nL5N1GK1TH] [nL5N1GR18A]

The "big four" which also includes Wal-Mart's Asda have had to respond to the growing presence of German discounters Aldi and Lidl.

Shares in Sainsbury's were down 0.6 percent at 270 pence at 1122 GMT, paring its 2017 gains to 8.2 percent.

ARGOS SHINES

Sainsbury's sales at supermarket stores open over a year fell 0.5 percent, excluding fuel, in the nine weeks to March 11, the last quarter of its financial year. That compared to analysts' forecasts ranging down 1 percent to up 0.3 percent

After adjusting for this year's later timing of Mother's Day and Easter the outcome was in line with its third quarter when like-for-like sales rose 0.1 percent, it said. [nL5N1F1120]

The results showed a strong performance from Argos, where underlying sales increased 4.3 percent, accelerating from growth of 4.0 percent in the previous quarter and ahead of analysts' forecasts.

Rivals Morrisons and Tesco are both in turnaround mode after going through disastrous periods while Sainsbury's market share has remained broadly stable over the last five years.

Its profits have still fallen however.

Analysts are on average forecasting a 2016-17 pretax profit of 578 million pounds, which would be a third straight year of decline, despite the boost to earnings from the Argos deal.

HSBC analyst David McCarthy also argues that sterling's fall could wipe out all the synergies of the Argos deal.

"As we progress through 2017, we expect life to get tougher for Argos and consumers. Argos will see rising costs and input prices, while consumers are likely to see a decline in discretionary incomes," said McCarthy who has a "reduce", rating on the stock. ($1 = 0.8165 pounds)

CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Walmex to increase spending by 19 percent in 2017  - 路透新闻

{{20170315T230438.525+0000}}CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Walmex to increase spending by 19 percent in 2017 (Corrects to attribute quote to Philip Behn, not Todd Harbaugh, in 7th paragraph.)

By Dan Freed

MEXICO CITY, March 14 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart de Mexico , Mexico's biggest retailer, plans to increase spending by nearly 19 percent in 2017, upgrading and adding new stores and investing in e-commerce, a top executive said on Tuesday.

Walmex, as the company is known, will spend 17 billion pesos ($864.80 million) in 2017, above the 14.3 billion pesos they spent last year, Chief Financial Officer Pedro Farah told investors during a company presentation.

Walmex continues to see opportunities to add stores and has become more efficient with its construction projects, according to Gaston Wainstein, Walmex head of real estate.

However, Central America head Carlos Arroyo said the region is not growing as quickly as the company would like, which is limiting the number of stores it is prepared to build there.

Walmex also said it is paying 35 percent more in bonuses to its low-level employees this year than it did a year ago. It also plans to open a second meat-cutting plant in the northern Mexican city of Monterrey, executives said on Tuesday.

Executives from the retailer, controlled by Wal-Mart Stores Inc , repeatedly emphasized investments in e-commerce.

"We don't think e-commerce is a loss leader," said Philip Behn, Walmex's head of eCommerce, calling it a driver of growth, profit and capital efficiency. ($1 = 19.6577 Mexican pesos)

Walmex, as the company is known, showed statistics that underscored how much better its top stores were performing compared to its worst. The retailer, controlled by Wal-Mart Stores , is also investing to expand its ecommerce business, said Todd Harbaugh, head of Mexico operations.

POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street alourdie par l'énergie en attendant la Fed - 路透新闻

{{20170314T212854.355+0000}}POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street alourdie par l'énergie en attendant la Fed(Actualisé avec cours du pétrole, volumes, dollar, Treasuries)

* Les cours du brut ont touché leurs plus bas depuis fin novembre

* Une tempête de neige a affecté les compagnies aériennes

* Le Dow a perdu 0,21%, le S&P 0,34%, le Nasdaq 0,32%

par Rodrigo Campos

NEW YORK, 14 mars (Reuters) - La Bourse de New York a fini en baisse mardi, affectée par le repli des cours du brut à leurs plus bas niveaux depuis trois mois, dans un marché par ailleurs dominé par la prudence à la veille des annonces de la Réserve fédérale américaine (Fed).

L'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> a perdu 44,11 points, soit 0,21% à 20.837,37 points. Le S&P-500 <.SPX>, plus large, a perdu 8,02 points, soit 0,34%, à 2.365,45. Le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> a reculé de son côté de 18,97 points (-0,32%) à 5.856,82 points.

Le comité de politique monétaire de la Fed, qui a entamé mardi une réunion de deux jours, devrait décider mercredi d'un nouveau relèvement d'un quart de point de l'objectif de taux des "fed funds".

Si ce relèvement est largement attendu, le calendrier du resserrement monétaire de la Fed en 2017 reste incertain et les opérateurs de marché guetteront toute indication à ce sujet lors de la conférence de presse de sa présidente, Janet Yellen.

La chute des cours du brut après la publication du rapport mensuel de l'Opep a par ailleurs pénalisé les valeurs pétrolières. Selon ce rapport, les stocks mondiaux de pétrole ont continué d'augmenter au mois de janvier malgré l'entrée en vigueur en début d'année d'un accord de réduction de la production visant à soutenir les prix du baril. [nL5N1GR3YL]

Le brut léger américain a touché un point bas de 47,09 dollars le baril dans la journée, puis s'est repris après la clôture. Mais il reste à ses plus bas depuis le 30 novembre, date de l'accord de l'Opep, après sept jours de repli d'affilée.

L'indice S&P des valeurs de l'énergie <.SPNY> (-1,10%) a accusé la plus forte baisse sectorielle du jour. Marathon Oil a perdu 3,28% et au sein de l'indice Dow Jones, Chevron a reculé de 1,82% et ExxonMobil de 0,53%.

LE DOLLAR S'APPRÉCIE

Les compagnies aériennes ont également pesé sur la tendance, un blizzard dans le nord-est des Etats-Unis ayant entraîné l'annulation de milliers de vols à travers le pays. L'indice sectoriel <.DJUSAR> a perdu 2,9% et United Continental Holdings a cédé 4,72%, deuxième plus forte baisse du S&P.

De même, les hôpitaux et des compagnies d'assurance médicale ont été délaissées après un rapport non-partisan annonçant que quatorze millions d'Américains allaient perdre leur couverture santé dès l'année prochaine si les républicains honorent leur promesse de démantèlement de "l'Obamacare". [nL5N1GR4Z6]

Aux valeurs individuelles, Wal-Mart a gagné 1,1%, en tête des hausses du Dow, en réaction à des commentaires positifs de Bank of America Merrill Lynch. [nL5N1GR5ZU]

MoneyGram International s'est envolé de 24,57%. Euronet Worldwide a lancé une offre de rachat du spécialiste de transfert de fonds qui le valorise à plus d'un milliard de dollars (940 millions d'euros). [nL5N1GR4ZS]

Lantheus Holdings en revanche a décroché de 12,28%, certains actionnaires ayant cédé trois millions d'actions.

Le laboratoire canadien Valeant Pharmaceuticals cotée à Wall Street a chuté de 10,1% en réaction à l'annonce par Pershing Square, le fonds spéculatif du milliardaire William Ackman, de la vente de toute sa participation. [nL5N1GR4KI]

Snap , propriétaire de la messagerie Snapchat, a perdu 2,42%, le cabinet eMarketer ayant revu en baisse sa prévision de revenus publicitaires pour 2017 de 30 millions de dollars (28 millions d'euros). [nL5N1GR5FQ]

Quelque 6,23 milliards de titres ont changé de mains, un volume en légère baisse par rapport aux 6,93 milliards d'actions échangées en moyenne au cours des 20 dernières séances.

Sur le marché des changes, le dollar s'apprécie de 0,43% face à un panier de devises de référence <.DXY>, soutenu par la perspective d'une hausse de taux de la Fed et l'inquiétude sur le résultat des élections législatives aux Pays-Bas mercredi.

Les rendements de obligations à long terme du Trésor américain ont baissé, le repli des cours du pétrole étant vu comme un facteur de ralentissement de l'inflation. Mais la baisse a été freinée par l'attente des décisions de la Fed.

BOURSE-Wal-Mart en tête du Dow Jones après une note de BofA Merrill - 路透新闻

{{20170314T174214.954+0000}}BOURSE-Wal-Mart en tête du Dow Jones après une note de BofA Merrill14 mars (Reuters) - Wal-Mart gagne plus de 1% à Wall Street mardi, en tête des hausses du Dow Jones, en réaction à des commentaires positifs de Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

L'action du numéro un mondial de la distribution prend 1,43% à 70,95 dollars vers 17h35 GMT après une pointe à 71,20 dollars.

BofA Merrill Lynch a ajouté le titre à sa liste "US 1 List" des valeurs qu'il conseille tout spécialement à ses clients, en maintenant sa recommandation "achat" et son objectif de 88 dollars, qui représente un potentiel de 26% par rapport au cours de clôture de lundi.

L'objectif de cours médian des brokers de Wall Street est actuellement à 73 dollars et une majorité d'entre eux, 20 sur 35, ont une opinion neutre sur le titre.

Dans sa note, l'analyste de BofA Merrill Lynch, Robert Ohmes, écrit que l'accent mis sur les magasins aux Etats-Unis, de loin le premier marché du groupe, et les activités de commerce en ligne semble porter ses fruits.

Wal-Mart a publié des ventes comparables meilleures que prévu au quatrième trimestre aux Etats-Unis, en hausse de 1,8% alors que Consensus Metrix avait une prévision de 1,3%.

A la clôture de lundi, le titre affichait une hausse de 4,1% sur les 12 mois écoulés, à comparer à un gain de 5,12% pour son indice sectoriel S&P <.SPLRCS>.

US STOCKS-Wall St set to falter at the open as Fed meets - 路透新闻

* British gov't gets parliament nod to launch Brexit talks

* Valeant plunges after Ackman exits stake

* Futures down: Dow 62 pts, S&P 8 pts, Nasdaq 13.25 pts

(Adds details, comments, updates prices)

By Yashaswini Swamynathan

March 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks looked set to open marginally lower on Tuesday as investors fixed their sights on the outcome of a meeting where the Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates for the first time this year.

The Fed meets over two days starting Tuesday, with traders pricing in a 90 percent chance of a quarter point rate hike as inflation picks up and the labor market shows solid strength.

Early on Tuesday, Dow e-minis <1YMc1> were down 62 points, or 0.3 percent, with 12,309 contracts changing hands.

S&P 500 e-minis were down 8 points, or 0.34 percent, with 132,876 contracts traded.

Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 13.25 points, or 0.25 percent, on volume of 6,560 contracts.

The Fed's statement is due at 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday, which will be followed by Fed Chair Janet Yellen's press conference.

"Ahead of a major data point like the Fed, you typically don't see big investors move sharply in one way or the other," said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer at 50 Park Investments in Florida.

"Investors are taking a wait-and-see approach, don't expect any fireworks today."

Wall Street's top banks were unanimous on the view the Fed would raise rates at its policy meeting, a Reuters poll showed on Friday. [nL2N1GP0HB]

The next big question for the market is whether the Fed signals a more aggressive tightening path than previously expected, especially as markets are betting on a potential economic boost from President Donald Trump's proposed fiscal policies.

Wall Street's major indexes have been largely kept in check since the start of the month as investors prepared for higher rates following a slew of hawkish comments from top Fed officials.

On Monday, stocks ended flat with the S&P 500 trading in its tightest range this year.

Shares of Valeant plunged 13 percent to $10.56 in heavy premarket trading on Tuesday after billionaire investor William Ackman said his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, sold its entire stake in the company. [nFWN1GQ0QW]

Dow component Wal-Mart was up 1.1 percent at $70.69.

GB-Asda propose un meilleur salaire pour plus de flexibilité - 路透新闻

{{20170313T171756.675+0000}}GB-Asda propose un meilleur salaire pour plus de flexibilitéLONDRES, 13 mars (Reuters) - La chaîne de supermarchés Asda, filiale britannique de l'américain Wal-Mart , propose à ses employés une revalorisation salariale de 14% en échange d'un nouveau contrat de travail imposant plus de flexibilité.

Le numéro trois britannique du secteur a annoncé lundi qu'il offrirait à partir d'octobre à ses 135.000 employés de magasin un salaire de base horaire de 8,50 livres (9,74 euros) contre 7,44 livres actuellement.

Ce montant est supérieur d'une livre au taux horaire du salaire minimum de subsistance ("National Living Wage") qui passera à 7,50 livres le 1er avril en Grande-Bretagne.

Dans le cadre du nouveau contrat, les employés d'Asda seront amenés à travailler dans différents rayons du magasin, à des plages horaires et journalières variées, y compris les jours fériés. Les temps de pause seront également décomptés des heures de travail.

Selon la chaîne de supermarchés, le nouveau contrat sera plus bénéfique pour 95% de ses employés actuels. Ceux qui le refuseront conserveront leur contrat actuel et seront payés au salaire minimum de 7,50 livres.

Asda, numéro quatre de la grande distribution en Grande-Bretagne derrière Tesco , Sainsbury's et Morrisons , a été à la traîne de son secteur sur les deux dernières années.

Au quatrième trimestre, le rythme de baisse des ventes a toutefois ralenti à 2,9% à magasins comparables et hors essence, ce qui laisse penser que l'initiative du nouveau directeur général Sean Clarke de se concentrer sur les prix et la qualité des produits commence à porter ses fruits.

UK supermarket Asda offers pay rise for flexible working - 路透新闻

{{20170313T161153.965+0000}}UK supermarket Asda offers pay rise for flexible workingLONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - Asda, the British supermarket owned by Wal-Mart , is offering staff in its stores a 14 percent rise in hourly pay, if they sign a contract requiring more flexible working.

Britain's No. 3 supermarket said on Monday it will offer its 135,000 store staff a base rate of 8.50 pounds ($10.39) an hour from October, up from 7.44 pounds.

The new rate is 1 pound above the government mandated National Living Wage increase which comes into effect April 1.

The new contract will require Asda staff to work in different parts of stores and different days or hours, including public holidays. All breaks will also move to being unpaid.

Asda's move comes as the Bank of England is closely watching a pick-up in inflation for signs it might fuel higher pay settlements.[nL5N1FT2M3]

Asda said that 95 percent of current employees will be better off if they move to the new contract. If they do not, their base rate will move up to the minimum national rate of 7.50 pounds and they will retain their existing contract.

Asda, which trails market leader Tesco and Sainsbury's by annual sales, has been the sector laggard for the last two years.

However, a trading update last month showed it had stemmed the pace of sales decline, suggesting new CEO Sean Clarke's focus on pricing and product quality was starting to have an impact. [nL8N1G63PS] ($1 = 0.8181 pounds)

UPDATE 2-UK's Morrisons caution on import costs overshadows profit rise - 路透新闻

{{20170309T112948.343+0000}}UPDATE 2-UK's Morrisons caution on import costs overshadows profit rise* Says uncertainty around imported food prices

* Also flags higher depreciation, pension, staff costs

* Underlying full-year profit rises for first time in five years

(Adds CEO, analyst comment, shares)

By James Davey

LONDON, March 9 (Reuters) - Morrisons , Britain's fourth biggest supermarket chain, warned more expensive food imports were creating uncertainties after a new management team delivered a first rise in annual profit in five years.

Shares in Morrisons, which trails market leader Tesco , Sainsbury's and Asda in annual sales, fell as much as 6 percent after the group also flagged an increase of up to 50 million pounds ($61 million) in depreciation and pension costs in 2017-18. It also faces higher staff costs.

"There are some uncertainties ahead, especially around the impact on imported food prices if sterling stays at lower levels," the company said on Thursday.

Morrisons said all the increased costs were incorporated into its plan and it was confident its turnaround was on track.

However, the stock was down 12.7 pence at 234 pence at 1110 GMT, the cautious comments taking some of the shine off an improved performance under Chief Executive David Potts.

Former Tesco executive Potts joined Morrisons in 2015 with the job of reviving the group after it was damaged by the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl in its northern England heartland.

Potts has delivered a steady improvement in trading, helped by more competitive prices, improved product ranges and availability and better customer service, resulting in a 22 percent rise in the firm's shares over the last year.

RISING PRICES

All of Britain's supermarket chains are having to deal with higher import costs as the pound has fallen about 11.5 percent against the euro and 19 percent against the U.S. dollar since June's Brexit vote.

The intensely competitive nature of Britain's food market means it is hard for grocers to pass on those increased costs to consumers. However, industry data published on Tuesday showed food inflation has doubled in a month. [nL5N1GK1TH]

Potts has also shed peripheral businesses and overhauled Morrisons' online strategy through a renegotiated agreement with distributor Ocado and a wholesale supply deal with Amazon .

"Overall the results are solid...but we don't see any material new positive surprises," said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne.

Morrisons has recently been setting the pace in terms of UK industry sales. Sales at stores open over a year rose 2.5 percent year-on-year in its fourth quarter, while monthly industry data has indicated a positive start to 2017-18.

Some analysts believe Morrisons is vulnerable to a stronger Tesco and a fightback from Asda in 2017.

However, Potts was relaxed. "In the very end a stronger competitor makes for a stronger Morrisons because we learn from competitors but obsess about our customers," he told reporters.

Morrisons reported an 11.6 percent rise in underlying pretax profit to 337 million pounds for the year to Jan. 29, ahead of analysts' average forecasts, on turnover up 1.2 percent to 16.3 billion pounds.

Net debt was cut to 1.19 billion pounds and forecast to fall below 1 billion pounds by the end of 2017-18. Cost savings beyond the 1 billion pounds already achieved were also forecast. ($1 = 0.8226 pounds)

Handelsriese Carrefour wegen Frankreich-Malaise unter Druck - 路透新闻

{{20170309T080611.855+0000}}Handelsriese Carrefour wegen Frankreich-Malaise unter DruckParis, 09. Mrz (Reuters) - Die französische Supermarktkette Carrefour leidet weiter unter schwachen Geschäften auf dem Heimatmarkt. Europas größter Einzelhändler wies am Donnerstag für 2016 einen überraschend großen Rückgang beim Betriebsgewinn aus dem fortlaufenden Geschäft von 3,8 Prozent auf 2,35 Milliarden Euro aus. In Frankreich brach das Ergebnis um mehr als 13 Prozent auf eine Milliarde Euro ein. Dort steht der Metro-Rivale wegen eines verschärften Konkurrenzkampfs unter Druck. Zudem kommen die für Carrefour typischen Großsupermärkte bei den Kunden nicht mehr so gut an. Daher steckt der Konzern viel Geld in Renovierungen. In diesem Jahr sollen diese Investitionen jedoch um 100 Millionen auf 2,4 Milliarden Euro gekürzt werden.

Für 2017 stellt Carrefour ein Umsatzplus von drei bis fünf Prozent in Aussicht. Hoffnung machen die Sparten in anderen europäischen Ländern wie Spanien, wo sich die Geschäftserholung fortsetzt, und in Italien, wo die Ertragskraft verbessert wurde. Eine Stütze ist ferner der Markt in Brasilien trotz der dortigen Rezession.[nL5N1GK3X8] In China, das fünf Prozent zum Konzernumsatz beiträgt, schreibt der Rivale des US-Weltmarktführers Wal-Mart weiter Verluste.

GB-La hausse des prix alimentaires a doublé en un mois-Kantar - 路透新闻

{{20170307T103959.527+0000}}GB-La hausse des prix alimentaires a doublé en un mois-KantarLONDRES, 7 mars (Reuters) - La hausse des prix alimentaires en Grande-Bretagne a doublé depuis le mois dernier, les prix de denrées de base comme le beurre, le thé, l'agneau et le poisson ayant tous augmenté, montre une étude publiée mardi, qui souligne l'impact du vote en faveur du Brexit sur les tickets de caisse.

La hausse des prix dans les supermarchés s'est élevée à 1,4% sur les 12 semaines au 26 février, contre 0,7% sur les 12 semaines au 29 janvier, selon les données du cabinet Kantar Worldpanel.

Les prix alimentaires sont orientés à la hausse depuis le dernier trimestre 2016, mettant un terme à la tendance déflationniste à l'oeuvre depuis plus de deux ans.

Deux autres études séparées montrent que les consommateurs britanniques ont réduit leurs dépenses non essentielles, les coûts d'importation, gonflés par la dépréciation de la livre qui a suivi le vote des Britanniques en faveur de la sortie de l'Union européenne, pesant sur leurs achats au quotidien.

"Les aliments de base comme le beurre, le thé et le poisson ont tous augmenté de plus de 5% au cours des 12 dernières semaines, tandis que les prix des fruits et des légumes - dont beaucoup sont importés - ont également progressé", explique Fraser McKevitt chez Kantar Worldpanel.

Cependant, il souligne que l'inflation est loin de toucher toutes les catégories de produits, ceux des chips, du bacon et des oeufs enregistrant des baisses.

"Alors que les consommateurs pourraient commencer à ressentir un très légèr effet (du Brexit), la hausse de l'inflation a conduit à la croissance du marché dans son ensemble", ajoute-t-il.

Les ventes totales des supermarchés sur les 12 semaines au 26 février ont augmenté de 2,3%, leur croissance la plus rapide depuis juin 2014.

Les ventes du leader Tesco ont augmenté de 0,6%, leur sixième période consécutive de hausse. Celles de Sainsbury"s , deuxième distributeur britannique, ont progressé de 0,3%, leur première croissance depuis mars 2016.

Si les ventes du numéro quatre, Morrisons, ont également enregistré une hausse de 2,6%, la plus forte depuis cinq ans, celle du numéro trois, Asda, ont elles reculé de 0,8%. Ce repli, qui correspond néanmoins à la meilleure performance de la filiale de Wal-Mart depuis novembre 2014, constitue un progrès par rapport à ses résultats précédents.

Le discounter Lidl [LIDUK.UL] a réalisé la meilleure performance avec une hausse de 13% sur cette même période de 12 semaines, tandis que son concurrent Aldi a vu ses ventes augmenter de 12,9%, lui permettant de s'octroyer une part de marché record de 6,3%, loin toutefois des 27,9% de Tesco.

UPDATE 1-UK food inflation doubles in a month - Kantar Worldpanel - 路透新闻

{{20170307T092854.499+0000}}UPDATE 1-UK food inflation doubles in a month - Kantar Worldpanel(Adds detail, background)

LONDON, March 7 (Reuters) - British food inflation has
doubled since last month, with the price of staples including
butter, tea, lamb and fish all rising, industry data showed on
Tuesday, adding to evidence that the impact of last year's
Brexit vote is pushing up shoppers' bills.

Market researcher Kantar Worldpanel said grocery inflation
was 1.4 percent for the 12 weeks to Feb. 26, up from 0.7 percent
in the 12 weeks to Jan. 29.

Food prices have been rising in Britain since the 12 weeks
to Jan 1, bringing to an end a more than two-year period when
prices fell.

Separately on Tuesday two other surveys showed British
consumers cutting back on non-essential spending as the impact
of the depreciation of sterling on import costs following last
year's decision to leave the European Union pushes up the cost
of their day-to-day shopping.[nU8N1D201E]

"Staples such as butter, tea and fish all saw prices rise by
more than 5 percent during the past 12 weeks, as fruit and
vegetables – many of which are imported – also saw an uptick in
price," said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer
insight at Kantar Worldpanel.

However, he pointed out that inflation is still far from
universal, with prices falling across a number of categories
including crisps, bacon and eggs.

"While consumers may be starting to feel a very slight
pinch, increased inflation has led to overall market growth,"
said McKevitt.

Overall grocery sales in the 12 weeks to Feb. 26 period rose
2.3 percent - the fastest rate since June 2014.

Sales at market leader Tesco  were up 0.6 percent, a
sixth period in a row of increased sales. They were up 0.3
percent at No. 2 supermarket Sainsbury's , its first
growth since March last year.

And sales were up 2.6 percent at No. 4, Morrisons, its
fastest growth in five years. But No. 3 supermarket Asda 
saw its sales fall 0.8 percent - still a significant improvement
and its best performance since November 2014.

Discounter Lidl [LIDUK.UL} was Britain's fastest growing
supermarket during the 12 weeks with sales up by 13.0 percent,
while rival Aldi [ALDIEI.UL] grew sales by 12.9 percent to reach
a record market share of 6.3 percent.

ACTUALIZA 1-Ventas comparables Wal-Mart de México crecen a menor ritmo en más de 2 años - 路透新闻

{{20170306T225831.197+0000}}ACTUALIZA 1-Ventas comparables Wal-Mart de México crecen a menor ritmo en más de 2 años(Agrega detalles)

CIUDAD DE MÉXICO, 6 mar (Reuters) - Las ventas comparables del gigante minorista Wal-Mart de México (Walmex) crecieron en febrero a su menor ritmo en más de dos años, a raíz de una caída en las visitas de sus clientes.

Las ventas iguales o comparables -las de aquellas tiendas con más de un año en operación- se incrementaron un 2.1 por ciento interanual en el segundo mes del año, según un reporte divulgado el lunes por la compañía.

La cifra marcó el desempeño de ventas iguales más flojo de la firma desde diciembre del 2014, cuando cayeron un 0.4 por ciento.

Walmex explicó que si bien el monto de compra promedio por cliente a unidades iguales registró un aumento de 5.0 por ciento durante febrero, el número de transacciones en sus tiendas disminuyó un 2.9 por ciento.

Las ventas totales consolidadas de la firma, que incluyen sus operaciones en Centroamérica, crecieron un 5.1 por ciento en el mes.

Para Centroamérica, la compañía controlada por el gigante estadounidense Wal-Mart Stores Inc reportó un alza del 2.6 por ciento en sus ventas comparables.

La minorista informó que en febrero abrió cinco tiendas y una más en lo que va de marzo, para un total de 3,030 unidades en operación.

Sus acciones cerraron el lunes en 39.69 pesos en la bolsa de México con una ganancia del 1.72 por ciento, antes de la divulgación del reporte.

UPDATE 4-Price war triggers Kroger's first same-store sales drop in 13 yrs - 路透新闻

{{20170302T164119.273+0000}}UPDATE 4-Price war triggers Kroger's first same-store sales drop in 13 yrs* Q4 same-store sales, excl. fuel, fall 0.7 pct vs. est. +0.1 pct

(Adds CEO comment, updates shares)

By Richa Naidu

March 2 (Reuters) - Supermarket operator Kroger Co surprised analysts with its first quarterly same-store sales decline in 13 years, as competition intensified in the U.S. grocery industry, sending its shares down as much as 5.6 percent on Thursday.

Kroger, like other grocers, has been struggling with lackluster U.S. economic growth and a cut-throat price war with Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Amazon Inc .

Cincinnati-based Kroger said, excluding fuel, sales from stores open for at least a year fell 0.7 percent, widely missing analysts' average estimate of a 0.1 percent rise, according to Consensus Metrix. Kroger blamed the decline on deflation.

This was Kroger's first quarterly same-store sales drop since the first quarter of 2003, raising concerns it is losing customers to rivals.

"With peers Ahold Delhaize , Walmart and Publix reporting better comparable sales than Kroger, it is becoming increasingly likely that the company is losing overall market share," J.P. Morgan analyst Ken Goldman said.

Price competition in the industry has been increasing, with Wal-Mart reportedly running a new price-comparison test to knock out competition from German discount grocery chain Aldi Inc [ALDIEI.UL] and Kroger. [nL2N1GC03L]

Target Corp said on Tuesday it would sacrifice full-year margins to keep its prices competitive. [nL3N1GD458]

Kroger has become more promotional and aggressive on some pricing as sales were softer, CEO Rodney McMullen told analysts on a call.

"There is no doubt several competitors are improving and running better stores ... it's much broader than just Walmart," he added.

Kroger, whose chains include Ralphs and Fred Meyer, forecast full-year earnings of $2.21-$2.25 per share, the midpoint of which meets analysts' average estimate of $2.23, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

"We are disappointed in the comparable number and are starting to wonder how Kroger will get anywhere near its long-term outlook for 8-11 percent earnings per share growth in today's environment," Goldman added.

The No. 1 U.S. supermarket chain said it expects full-year same-store sales excluding fuel to either remain flat or rise as much as 1 percent, short of the 1.2 percent rise analysts had estimated. [nPn6s02G8a]

Kroger's shares, which had already taken a 4 percent hit this week after news of Wal-Mart and Target's pricing strategies, were down 3.2 percent at $31.01 in morning trading.

The company earned 53 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 28, beating the average analyst estimate by one cent.

Net sales rose 5.5 percent to $27.61 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $27.31 billion.

UPDATE 1-Kona beer is not from Hawaii, consumers say in lawsuit - 路透新闻

{{20170301T003737.818+0000}}UPDATE 1-Kona beer is not from Hawaii, consumers say in lawsuit(Adds details from complaint, comment from defendant, paragraphs 4,6)

By Jonathan Stempel

Feb 28 (Reuters) - The maker of Kona craft beer was sued on Tuesday by two California shoppers who claim they were deceived into believing the beer was made in Hawaii, causing them to overpay for it.

Sara Cilloni and Simone Zimmer said Craft Brew Alliance Inc misleads consumers about the origin of its Kona Brewing Co beers, saying the fifth-largest U.S. craft brewer makes them in New Hampshire, Oregon, Tennessee and Washington state.

The plaintiffs said the alleged deception includes the use on labels of hula dancers, surfers, the Kilauea volcano, Waikiki beach, and other images and phrases associated with Hawaii, as well as beer names such as Big Wave Golden Ale, Castaway IPA, Fire Rock Pale Ale and Longboard Island Lager.

Despite this, nothing on the packaging makes clear where the beer is actually brewed, the complaint said.

"Consumers purchase items, and are willing to pay more for items, because they are from Hawaii," the complaint said. "Craft Brew is well aware of this."

A spokeswoman for Craft Brew Alliance said the company does not discuss pending litigation.

The Portland, Oregon-based company also owns the Redhook and Widmer Brothers brands, among others.

A lawyer for the plaintiffs was not immediately available for comment.

Tuesday's lawsuit filed in the federal court in San Jose, California, seeks class action status and unspecified damages for Kona purchasers in that state and nationwide over four years.

It is one of a handful of lawsuits that have accused beer sellers of deceptive marketing.

On Feb. 10, Wal-Mart Stores Inc was sued in Ohio by a consumer who said it sold at a premium price what appeared to be craft beer under the Trouble Brewing brand, but that no such brewery existed and the beer was contract-brewed.

Meanwhile, in 2015 a federal judge approved a roughly $20 million settlement of claims that Anheuser-Busch InBev NV tricked consumers into thinking its St. Louis-brewed Beck's beer was actually a German pilsner.

An Anheuser affiliate owns nearly one-third of Craft Brew Alliance, Reuters data show.

The case is Cilloni et al v Craft Brew Alliance Inc et al, U>S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 17-01027.

* Shares down 12 percent, close at lowest level since 2014

(Adds closing stock prices, CEO comments on President Trump's possible border tax)

By Nandita Bose and Richa Naidu

NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Target Corp said on Tuesday it will rely more on low prices to compete with rivals like Wal-Mart and Amazon, admitted many of its stores needed freshening up, and told Wall Street its sales and profit estimates for 2017 are too high.

Shares of the retailer plunged to 2-1/2-year lows in heavy trading. Many of its rivals fell, too, including deep discount chains that will now face tougher competition on prices. For investors, the news was a shocking reminder that U.S. retailing remains a cutthroat business.

Target vowed aggressive promotions at a meeting with analysts and investors, saying new brands and investments in technology and small stores will allow it to eventually win back market share.

Although its e-commerce operation is growing, Target reported its third straight quarter of lower sales from existing stores, citing "unexpected softness" at its stores.

Target also forecast first-quarter profit short of Wall Street estimates. Shares sank 12.1 percent to $58.79, their biggest one-day percentage drop since 2008.

The stock has lost a quarter of its value since the holiday shopping season started in November, back to levels last seen in August 2014.

The retail industry faces pressure from lackluster U.S. economic growth, intense competition from Amazon.com and other online rivals and concerns about President Donald Trump's planned border tax.

With Tuesday's announcement, Target's brand identity as a source for "cheap chic" fashion and other low-cost stylish goods is giving way to the push for lower prices, analysts said.

That prompted declines across the retail sector. Dow component Wal-Mart Stores Inc closed down 1.1 percent, Kroger Co fell 1.3 percent and Macy's Inc lost 1 percent. Dollar General Corp fell 4.9 percent and Dollar Tree was down 3.6 percent.

Shares of Amazon, whose market cap exceeds all those companies combined, closed down slightly.

The drop in Target shares also reflects missteps by the company, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.

"Target didn't do its job of trying to engage its customers and the theory is they may have lost the ability to do it," she said. "That's what the (stock) market is telling you."

The retailer plans "aggressive promotional activities" that would erode its operating profit by $1 billion this year, Chief Executive Brian Cornell said at the meeting on Tuesday.

Revamping older stores is also part of Cornell's plan. Target has "a large percentage of the portfolio where the buildings just don't match the brand. They are old. They're tired. And they have not been updated in years," he said on a conference call.

Target said it planned to invest $2 billion in 2017 on analytics, supply chain and opening 100 more small-format stores in urban neighborhoods and college markets. It also plans to launch more than 12 exclusive brands.

Target forecast full-year earnings of $3.80-$4.20 per share from continuing operations, while analysts on average were expecting profit above $5.00, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. [nBw2wpt55a]

TARGETING GROCERY SHOPPERS?

One of the first areas where prices will come down at Target is food, the company said. Food and pet supplies account for about a fifth of Target sales, according to its annual report.

On Monday, Reuters reported Wal-Mart launched a new front in U.S. price wars with a test in 1,200 stores to lower grocery prices. [nL2N1GC03L]

With Wal-Mart and Amazon already facing off on price, including in the grocery aisle, Target is in an uncomfortable middle ground. And where Wal-Mart has established itself as the nation's largest grocer, Target's foray into food has been less successful.

"Target is neither a full-line grocer nor a player with lots of niche specialty products; it is neither a high-end player, nor a price-focused discounter," said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.

Target's grocery offerings are "confusing," he said.

Two years ago, bigger rival Wal-Mart aggressively cut prices across the board and boosted its online presence. Target could not act then due to costs related to a massive data breach and its decision to pull out of Canada.

"Target's got bigger issues (than Wal-Mart had)," said analyst Brian Yarbrough of Edward Jones.

"They've struggled since Brian Cornell's come on to figure out what to do with their grocery department ... I think Target's turnaround could take a little bit longer than Wal-Mart."

Separately, CEO Cornell said he has been talking with the Trump administration to argue against a border tax that would raise the price of imports, including food like coffee and bananas.

"We are trying to make sure consumers are not waking up paying prices that are 15 or 20 or 25 percent higher," Cornell said. "And it wouldn't bring jobs back to the United States because we don't have factories that are ready to start manufacturing these products."

SALES DECLINES

Target's same-store sales fell 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, which includes the holiday season. That was steeper than the 1.3 percent drop analysts estimated, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.

Target expects same-store sales to decline by low-single digits in fiscal 2017. Analysts, on average, were expecting same-store sales to increase 0.4 percent in 2017.

A 34 percent jump in digital sales was not enough to keep overall net sales in the black. They fell for the sixth straight quarter, to $20.69 billion; adjusted profit of $1.45 per share was below the $1.51 expected.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Target's wobbly aim will take time to correct - 路透新闻

{{20170228T162928.328+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Target's wobbly aim will take time to correct(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Jennifer Saba

NEW YORK, Feb 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell is asking for patience. The U.S. retailer reported abysmal quarterly results, missing expectations and wiping out some $5 billion of stock-market value in the process. Pressures from the likes of Wal-Mart and Amazon are clearly taking a toll. A 34 percent jump in online sales is encouraging but Target will continue to struggle with changing shopping habits.

The now $33 billion retailer known for its bull's-eye red-and-white logo said its adjusted earnings forecast for 2017 will be in the range of $3.80 to $4.20 per share, well below the $5 that analysts had previously forecast. Same-store sales are expected to decline rather than increase slightly, as analysts originally expected.

Cornell was blunt in his requests during an annual investors' day on Tuesday: Target is taking the long view and margins will take a hit. The firm plans to invest heavily - some $7 billion over three years - buffing up its stores, rolling out new brands, and re-evaluating its footprint of more than 1,800 stores in the United States, especially in urban areas.

Target is optimistic that it is in a strong financial position to pick up some market share as other retailers shoulder burdensome debt. Moody's reckons that nearly 14 percent of its retail and apparel portfolio, including the owner of J Crew and Gymboree, is now composed of distressed issuers - the largest showing since December 2009. In the meantime, Target is bracing for a wave of price cuts from these struggling peers as well as Wal-Mart, which is further squeezing its suppliers.

On the digital front, Target plans to utilize what it considers a well-stocked quiver. Its storefronts, which serve as distribution points, allow people to shop online and pick up their order during the same day. Digital sales have grown to $3.4 billion last year, nearly 5 percent of the total top-line of $70 billion, from $1.4 billion in 2013. Yet investors looking for guideposts beyond this year will be out of luck when the retailer stops providing guidance. Target's wobbly aim will take time to correct - something its owners seem unwilling to give for now.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Target on Feb. 28 forecast a low-single-digit decline in comparable sales for 2017, well below analysts' estimates, which pegged a 0.4 percent increase for the year.

- During the fourth quarter ending Jan. 28, sales fell 4.3 percent year-over-year to $20.7 billion. Same-store sales dropped 1.5 percent. Net income was $817 million, or $1.45 per share, compared to $1.4 billion, or $2.32 per share. Analysts were expecting $1.51 per share.

- Digital revenue during the quarter rose 34 percent.

POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street ouvre en baisse avant Trump - 路透新闻

{{20170228T144230.213+0000}}POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street ouvre en baisse avant TrumpNEW YORK, 28 février (Reuters) - La Bourse de New York a débuté en léger repli mardi à quelques heures du discours de Donald Trump, au cours duquel il pourrait détailler le contenu et le calendrier de son programme économique.

Quelques minutes après le début des échanges, l'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> perd 28 points, soit 0,13%, à 20.809,44. Le Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX>, plus large, recule de 0,19% à 2.365,23 et le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> cède 0,18% à 5.851,58.

Le président des Etats-Unis doit s'adresser à 21h00 locales (02h00 GMT mercredi) aux membres du Congrès et il devrait évoquer ses intentions en matière de fiscalité, de dépenses militaires ou encore de réforme de l'assurance santé. [nL5N1GD4RJ]

Ses propos de lundi, devant un parterre de gouverneurs, sur sa volonté d'engager de "grosses" dépenses d'infrastructures et d'augmenter de 9% le budget du Pentagone ont contribué à la petite hausse de Wall Street, le Dow Jones <.DJI> finissant sur un nouveau record.

La priorité donnée au discours présidentiel a largement occulté les chiffres révisés du produit intérieur brut (PIB) américain au quatrième trimestre 2016, qui montrent une croissance de 1,9% en rythme annualisé, conforme à la premi-re estimation. [nL5N1GD5EX]

Le mois de février se solde pour l'instant par une hausse de 4,9% du Dow et de 4,4% du Nasdaq.

Aux valeurs, le groupe de grande distribution Target plonge de 13% après avoir annoncé que ses ventes pourraient continuer de baisser cette année. Dans son sillage, Wal-Mart cède 1,88%, la plus forte baisse du Dow.

A la hausse, Boeing profite encore de la perspective d'une hausse du budget de la Défense et prend 0,62%.

En Europe, les Bourses sont en légère hausse à moins de deux heures de la clôture: l'indice Stoxx 600 <.STOXX> gagne 0,11% et l'EuroStoxx 50 <.STOXX50E> 0,23%, le CAC 40 <.FCHI> à Paris 0,19% et le Dax à Francfort <.GDAXI> 0,08%.

MÄRKTE 10-Ausverkauf bei US-Einzelhändler Target nach Zahlen - 路透新闻

{{20170228T132434.239+0000}}MÄRKTE 10-Ausverkauf bei US-Einzelhändler Target nach ZahlenNew York, 28. Feb (Reuters) - Mit Verkäufen haben die Anleger in den USA am Dienstag auf die Geschäftszahlen von Target reagiert. Vorbörslich stürzten die Aktien des Einzelhändlers um fast zwölf Prozent ab und waren damit auf dem besten Wege, so niedrig wie zuletzt im Oktober 2014 in den offiziellen Handel einzusetzen. Der in Minneapolis ansässige Einzelhändler hatte im vierten Quartal einen überraschend starken Umsatzrückgang verzeichnet. Damit schrumpften die Umsätze netto das sechste Quartal in Folge. Auch 2017 dürften die Erlöse weiter fallen. Analysten hatten dagegen mit einer leichten Erholung gerechnet. Auch mit der Prognose von 3,80 bis 4,20 Dollar Gewinn je Aktie blieb das Unternehmen hinter den Schätzungen der Analysten von fünf Dollar zurück.

Im Sog von Target gaben auch die Aktien des weltgrößten Einzelhändlers Wal-Mart, die im Dow-Jones-Index<.DJI> gelistet sind, 1,3 Prozent nach.
