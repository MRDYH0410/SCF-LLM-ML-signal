(Repite nota transmitida en la noche. Texto sin cambios)

CIUDAD DE MÉXICO, 28 dic (Reuters) - Las acciones del gigante minorista Wal-Mart de México (Walmex) treparon el jueves a un máximo histórico, impulsadas por buenas perspectivas para la firma, en una sesión de escaso volumen por el periodo vacacional de fin de año.

Los papeles de Walmex , la mayor cadena minorista del país, subieron en la jornada un 0.81 por ciento, a 47.19 pesos, y acumulan un alza de 30.2 por ciento en el año.

La compañía dijo el jueves que este año abrió 29 unidades en Ciudad de México y otros cuatro estados del centro del país.

El alza de los papeles de Walmex se dio en una jornada con un volumen de negocios de apenas 5.4 millones de títulos, por debajo del promedio de las últimas semanas de más de 15 millones de acciones negociadas.

Las ventas comparables de Walmex aumentaron un 7.6 por ciento en noviembre, informó este mes la compañía, superando las expectativas de los analistas. [nL1N1O62J9]

Los papeles de la firma, controlada por el gigante estadounidense Wal-Mart Stores Inc , suman en diciembre una ganancia del 7.4 por ciento.

Ventas de Navidad en EEUU se dirigen a romper records por sorpresivo auge de minoristas - 路透新闻

{{20171227T231516.942+0000}}Ventas de Navidad en EEUU se dirigen a romper records por sorpresivo auge de minoristasSEATTLE/CHICAGO, 27 dic (Reuters)

Por Eric M. Johnson y Richa Naidu

SEATTLE/CHICAGO, 27 dic (Reuters) - La temporada de ventas de fin de año en Estados Unidos se encamina a romper cifras récord gracias a una mayor confianza de los consumidores y al auge del uso de los aparatos móviles, lo que dio un inesperado impulso a los minoristas y a las empresas de entrega de paquetes de las que dependen.

El período de fiestas de fin de año, crucial para los minoristas porque puede representar hasta un 40 por ciento de sus ventas anuales, registró un gasto récord de más de 800.000 millones de dólares en sitios en Internet y tiendas físicas este año, según la unidad analítica de Mastercard Inc .

Las apuestas son especialmente altas este año para los minoristas tradicionales, que han invertido en tecnología, entregas gratuitas y devoluciones, decididas a seguir siendo relevantes en un mercado cada vez más dominado por Amazon.com Inc .

"Ha sido una temporada de fiestas extremadamente positiva en términos de ventas, tanto para los negocios físicos como en Internet", dijo Shelley Kohan, de la empresa de análisis RetailNext.

Cifras preliminares muestran que el total de ventas de fin de año superará las estimaciones iniciales de RetailNext de un aumento de un 3,8 por ciento respecto del año pasado. "Todos los indicadores económicos fueron muy robustos, y por lo tanto creo que los consumidores están dispuestos a gastar más", sostuvo Kohan.

Mastercard dijo el martes que un repunte cerca del cierre de la temporada impulsó un aumento de un 18,1 por ciento de las ventas en línea. Las cadenas de tiendas por departamentos Macy's Inc y Target Corp notaron una mayor actividad durante el período.

Las empresas de envío de paquetes que gestionan las devoluciones a minoristas se han beneficiado de mayores volúmenes de entrega en los últimos años, pero también han debido invertir miles de millones de dólares para mejorar y ampliar sus redes para lidiar con el auge de las compras a través de medios electrónicos.

United Parcel Service Inc , la mayor empresa de entrega de paquetes del mundo, dijo el miércoles que se encamina a regresar una cifra récord de paquetes esta temporada, luego de que manejó más de un millón de devoluciones diarias en diciembre. Su rival FedEx Corp dijo que vio una nueva temporada récord de fin de año, pero rehusó entregar detalles.

UPS prévoit un nombre record de colis retournés cette fin d'année - 路透新闻

{{20171227T223522.982+0000}}UPS prévoit un nombre record de colis retournés cette fin d'annéeSEATTLE, 27 décembre (Reuters)

SEATTLE, 27 décembre (Reuters) - United Parcel Service devrait acheminer un nombre record de colis retournés durant cette période de fêtes de fin d'année, ce qui suggère que les achats en ligne ont atteint des nouveaux sommets au cours du mois dernier.

Le groupe de messagerie et de logistique d'Atlanta et son concurrent FedEx sont payés par les distributeurs comme Amazon.com et Wal-Mart Stores pour gérer leurs livraisons en ligne.

Les deux groupes ont bénéficié de la hausse des volumes de colis expédiés au cours de ces dernières années, mais ont également dû investir des milliards de dollars pour développer leurs réseaux.

UPS a déclaré mercredi avoir géré plus d'un million de retours adressés aux distributeurs en décembre, à un rythme qui devrait se poursuivre jusqu'à début janvier. Il a ajouté qu'un pic de 1,4 million de colis serait probablement atteint le 3 janvier, ce qui signerait un cinquième record annuel consécutif, soit une hausse de 8% par rapport à la même date l'année dernière.

Les distributeurs traditionnels et en ligne pourraient avoir réalisé des ventes record en cette période de fin d'année. Mastercard a fait état mardi de la plus forte hausse des ventes entre le 1er novembre et le 24 décembre depuis 2011. Il estime que les consommateurs ont dépensé plus de 800 milliards de dollars (682 milliards d'euros) sur cette période, un record.

De son côté, FedEx a déclaré avoir enregistré une activité record durant cette période, sans donner de davantage de précisions.

Le directeur du marketing Rajesh Subramaniam a indiqué la semaine dernière aux analystes que quelque 15% des articles achetés en ligne étaient retournés et que les vêtements en représentaient 30%.

Transgender woman sues Wal-Mart over alleged bias in N. Carolina - 路透新闻

{{20171227T222635.829+0000}}Transgender woman sues Wal-Mart over alleged bias in N. CarolinaDec 27 (Reuters)

By Jonathan Stempel

Dec 27 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc was sued on Wednesday by a transgender woman who said she was wrongfully fired after complaining about harassment at the Sam's Club warehouse store in North Carolina where she had worked for 11 years.

Charlene Bost, 46, said co-workers at the Kannapolis store where she had been a member service supervisor called her "sir," "that thing with an attitude" and "shim," a slur combining "she" and "him." She also said her male boss subjected her to unwanted physical advances and referred to her as "it."

The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and improved training to stop harassment of transgender workers at Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer. Kannapolis is a suburb of Charlotte.

"Wal-Mart maintains a strong anti-discrimination policy. We support diversity and inclusion in our workforce and do not tolerate discrimination or retaliation of any kind," company spokesman Randy Hargrove said. "We disagree with the claims raised by Ms. Bost. Her termination was for performance reasons. We will respond as appropriate with the court."

North Carolina has also been home to a long-running debate over when transgender people may use public bathrooms.

Bost sued in the same court weighing the legality of a North Carolina bathroom access law passed in March that critics consider too vague. [nL1N1KC0FA]

That law replaced a more controversial "bathroom bill" that caused some businesses to pull events from the state.

According to her complaint, Bost began working in the Kannapolis store in March 2004, and began expressing her female identity there in 2008.

She said she was fired in March 2015 in retaliation for her complaints, or else the perception that she suffered from "gender dysphoria," or distress with the sex she was assigned at birth. Bost had also filed charges with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

Jillian Weiss, executive director of the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund Inc in New York, which filed Bost's lawsuit, said employers such as Wal-Mart need to understand that simply having tough anti-discrimination policies is not enough.

"The difficulty here is that Wal-Mart has a good policy, but when a person like Ms. Bost came forward to say she was having trouble because of the discrimination she faced, its enforcement mechanisms were insufficient," Weiss said in an interview. "Corporations have to enforce compliance with anti-discrimination policies, not merely cite their existence."

The case is Bost v. Sam's East Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Middle District of North Carolina, No. 17-01148.

RPT-UPDATE 2-As online shopping grows, UPS sees record holiday package returns - 路透新闻

{{20171227T214412.000+0000}}RPT-UPDATE 2-As online shopping grows, UPS sees record holiday package returnsSEATTLE, Dec 27 (Reuters)

(Repeats story first published earlier on Wednesday)

By Eric M. Johnson

SEATTLE, Dec 27 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc is on track to return a record number of packages this holiday shipping season, a sign that e-commerce purchases surged to new heights over the past month.

The world's largest package delivery company and rival FedEx Corp get paid by retailers like Amazon.com Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc for handling e-commerce deliveries.

Both have benefited from booming delivery volumes over the past few years, but also have had to invest billions of dollars to upgrade and expand their networks to cope.

UPS said on Wednesday it handled more than 1 million returns to retailers daily in December, a pace expected to last into early January. It said returns would likely peak at 1.4 million on Jan. 3, which would be a fifth consecutive annual record, up 8 percent from this year.

The returns follow what could be the strongest holiday shopping season on record for both brick-and-mortar and online retailers, once stores publish sales data. Mastercard Inc said on Tuesday U.S. shoppers spent over $800 billion during the season, more than ever before. [nL1N1OQ0QC]

FedEx said on Wednesday it experienced another record-breaking peak shipping season, but declined to provide specifics. The company's Chief Marketing Officer Rajesh Subramaniam told analysts last week about 15 percent of all goods purchased online are returned, with apparel running at about 30 percent. [nL1N1OJ1XF]

UPS said record-breaking e-commerce sales during Black Friday and Cyber Monday in late November jolted the returns season, with a larger flood of packages going back to retailers even as many gifts sat under Christmas trees.

UPS has worked for years to increase its ability to forecast customer shipping demands to handle major package volume spikes ahead of the holidays. It has also raised shipping rates and added 2018 peak-season surcharges. [nL2N1N026T]

The returns delivered in 2017 are part of the 750 million packages UPS said it expects to deliver globally during the peak shipping season from the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday through New Year's Eve. That is an increase of nearly 40 million over the previous year.

UPS and FedEx shares were both up slightly on Wednesday.

SEATTLE/CHICAGO, Dec 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. holiday shopping season is on track to break sales records on the back of surging consumer confidence and increased use of mobile devices, presenting an unexpected boon for retailers and the delivery companies they rely on.

The holiday shopping season, a crucial period for retailers that can account for up to 40 percent of annual sales, brought record-breaking online and in-store spending this year of more than $800 billion, according to Mastercard Inc's analytics arm. [nL1N1OQ0QC]

Stakes are particularly high this year for traditional retailers that have invested heavily in technology and free delivery and returns, determined to stay relevant in a market increasingly dominated by Amazon.com Inc .

"It has been an extremely positive holiday season in terms of sales both for brick-and-mortar and for online businesses," said Shelley Kohan, a Retail Fellow at analytics firm RetailNext.

Preliminary numbers show total holiday sales will exceed RetailNext's initial forecast of a 3.8 percent increase from last year. "All the economic indicators were very strong, and so I think consumers were more willing to open up their wallets and purses and spend more," Kohan added.

RetailNext and most other analytics firms and industry groups - including Adobe Analytics and the National Retail Federation - are due to publish holiday sales data in January.

Mastercard Inc said on Tuesday that a late-season rally had driven an 18.1 percent rise in online sales. Department store chain Macy's Inc and Target Corp both noted increased activity during that time.

Target spokesman Joshua Thomas told Reuters that during the week before Christmas the company had seen a marked increase in shoppers picking up online orders in stores, while Macy's spokeswoman Blair Rosenberg said last-minute shoppers boosted fragrance sales during that period.

The S&P retail index <.SPXRT> was flat on Wednesday.

SANTA'S LITTLE HELPERS

Package delivery companies that handle returns for retailers have benefited from booming delivery volumes in recent years, but also have had to invest billions of dollars to upgrade and expand their networks to cope as e-commerce purchases surge to new heights.

Delivering individual packages to shoppers - and picking up returns - is a lower margin business for delivery companies, which make more when they deliver in bulk to businesses.

United Parcel Service Inc , the world's largest package delivery company, said on Wednesday it was on track to return a record number of packages this holiday, having handled more than 1 million returns to retailers daily in December. [nL1N1OR0PN]

That pace is expected to continue into early January, UPS said, and would likely peak at 1.4 million on Jan. 3, which would be a fifth consecutive annual record, up 8 percent from this year.

Rival FedEx Corp said it experienced another record-breaking peak shipping season, but declined to provide specifics. The company's Chief Marketing Officer Rajesh Subramaniam told analysts last week about 15 percent of all goods purchased online are returned, with apparel running at about 30 percent. [nL1N1OJ1XF]

UPS has worked for years to increase its ability to forecast customer shipping demands to handle major package volume spikes ahead of the holidays. It has also raised shipping rates and added 2018 peak-season surcharges. [nL2N1N026T]

The returns delivered in 2017 are part of the 750 million packages UPS said it expects to deliver globally during the peak shipping season from the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday through New Year's Eve. That is an increase of nearly 40 million over the previous year.

UPS and FedEx shares both ended up slightly on Wednesday.

CORRECTED-BREAKINGVIEWS-Unilever and Nestlé will sidestep supermarkets - 路透新闻

{{20171227T102735.000+0000}}CORRECTED-BREAKINGVIEWS-Unilever and Nestlé will sidestep supermarketsLONDON, Dec 27 (Reuters Breakingviews)

((Corrects Dec. 27 item in fifth paragraph to specify that the impact on consumer companies' operating margins relates to European markets. The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.))

By Carol Ryan

LONDON, Dec 27 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Self-preservation will force Unilever and Nestlé to bypass supermarket shelves. The duo are caught between grocers striking tougher bargains, new ways of shopping that make marketing less effective, and activist investors demanding fatter margins. Selling direct to shoppers is the inevitable but risky response.

Consumer giants can no longer mass-produce products and sell them at a huge markup to retailers. Supermarkets are forcing down prices to maintain their own profits and growing less reliant on branded goods. Grocers' own-label products now account for more than a third of all packaged food sales in the UK, Euromonitor data shows.

Startups, meanwhile, have become formidable rivals. Viral marketing helped dairy minnow Chobani corner a fifth of the U.S. yogurt market in a decade. The smallest companies captured 64 percent of growth in the U.S. market for branded goods in the five years to 2015, while the biggest took 4 percent, according to Bain analysts.

New challenges are emerging. Devices that allow consumers to shop online by voice, such as Amazon's Echo, will make it harder to influence shoppers via marketing. And activist investors such as Third Point founder Dan Loeb have started holding big consumer companies to higher standards. Nestlé, Danone , and Unilever in 2017 raised their operating margin targets by roughly a fifth.

In a worst-case scenario, consumer companies could see their operating margin decline by 45 percent in the European market over the next five years unless they address this array of challenges, Bain reckons.

The strategy has risks. It would cause tensions with powerful retailers like Walmart and Carrefour , which still generate the lion's share of manufacturers' revenue. And boosting direct-to-consumer sales through acquisitions is expensive when valuations are high. Take Unilever, which makes just 3 percent of its sales online. To grow to the roughly 8 percent that Tesco manages, the Anglo-Dutch group would need to buy another 16 Dollar Shave Clubs based on the $1 billion startup's estimated $200 million of sales last year. The price that will have to be paid may not be as high as the cost of inaction.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Nestlé, the world's largest food company, aims to achieve an underlying trading operating profit margin of between 17.5 and 18.5 percent by 2020. Anglo-Dutch group Unilever's underlying operating margin target is 20 percent.

- The two consumer companies' operating margins rose to decade-highs of 15.3 percent and 16.4 percent respectively in 2016.

CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-South African discount tycoon says Steinhoff, Shoprite tie-up "natural" - 路透新闻

{{20171222T082430.985+0000}}CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-South African discount tycoon says Steinhoff, Shoprite tie-up "natural"CAPE TOWN, Sept 28 (Reuters)

(Corrects Sept 28, 2016 story to clarify Christo Wiese did not start Pepkor in paragraph 11)

By Tiisetso Motsoeneng and Wendell Roelf

CAPE TOWN, Sept 28 (Reuters) - It would be a "natural development" for international retail group Steinhoff to take over Shoprite , Africa's biggest supermarket chain, South African tycoon Christo Wiese told Reuters, sending shares in the grocery group surging 4 percent.

Wiese is the largest shareholder in both Shoprite and Steinhoff, a lower-end furniture, apparel and household goods retailer. Bringing the two together would allow him to add groceries to his sprawling discount empire.

The merger, if it happens, would also pull together Wiese's retail assets under one roof following Steinhoff's nearly $6 billion acquisition in 2014 of Wiese's budget clothing retailer Pepkor and create a global giant worth at least 400 billion rand ($30 billion).

"People will speculate about that," he said in a rare interview on Tuesday at his modest offices overlooking factories in the dusty northern Cape Town industrial suburb of Parow.

"People know that I am 75 years old, and I fortunately have a son who is in business with me, but as a family we are continually looking at consolidating our business interests. So, it would be, in a way, a natural development."

Since Steinhoff's Pepkor acquisition, some analysts have wondered if Wiese, along with Shoprite's chief executive Whitey Basson and Steinhoff's Markus Jooste were working on a tie-up.

Although grocery retailing would be uncharted territory for Steinhoff, one fund manager said the company's propensity to run a decentralised business model would help it pull off any such deal.

"It will be quite a big step given that the grocery sector is somewhat different to the rest of Steinhoff. However Wiese, Markus Jooste and Whitey Basson have great experience in their respective areas," Lentus Asset Management's Nic Norman Smith said. "If anyone is going make it work, it's these three."

Shares in Shoprite, which have been little changed so far this year, jumped 4.3 percent shortly after Reuters reported Wiese's comments before extending gains to trade 4.6 percent higher at 196.69 rand as of 1453 GMT.

Johannesburg-listed shares in Steinhoff, which is also listed in Frankfurt, added at least 2 percent to gains notched up earlier on news that it would issue shares to fund deals. The stock was up 6.2 percent at 80.70 rand.

Wiese, who describes himself as a "realist, pragmatist", was one of the early executives of budget clothing retailer Pepkor, which was co-founded by his parents in the 1960s in Upington on the southern edges of the Kalahari desert, after spotting an opportunity to bring cheaper clothes to the poor.

He then transformed Shoprite from a six-store company in the 1970s to one with hundreds of stores across Africa, from South Africa to the Democratic Republic of Congo, dwarfing rivals including Wal-Mart's South African unit Massmart .

His discount strategy, which also now includes investments in clothes retailer New Look, has catapulted him to the cover of Forbes magazine as one of Africa's richest businessmen.

"Why is it so successful? ... The people who earn a lot of money are a small portion and then at the base is where your mass market is, where people have limited disposable income and we're aiming at that market," he said.

Wiese studied law in Stellenbosch, a close-knit town dominated by Afrikaans-speaking whites, but lives in Clifton, an area of Cape Town overlooking the Atlantic Ocean with some of South Africa's most expensive properties.

He owns a high-end vineyard near Stellenbosch, an area dotted with executive golf clubs, but said he "finds playing golf boring."

NEW LOOK

Wiese is also a top shareholder and board member in South African investment heavyweight Brait SE , which last year bought gym chain Virgin Active, a relative outlier in his business model as it targets middle-class consumers.

More in line with the low-cost theme, was Brait's purchase of no-frills retailer New Look.

Wiese said Brait's "most obvious" growth trajectory was through its existing businesses that also include U.K. supermarket chain Iceland Foods and South African staples foods maker Premier.

"There is plenty of scope (to grow). It's got a strong management team and the biggest scope lies within the existing businesses. New Look for instance, our clothing retail operation in the UK, has identified China as a major growth area," he said.

Wiese said New Look was looking to open 500 stores within three years in China, where it already runs 90 outlets.

"China is an enormous market," Wiese said, describing the New Look's store expansion plan as a "drop in the ocean" given the size of the Chinese population.

Virgin Active, which has taken top spot market in Italy and its biggest chain is located in South Africa, has identified Asia-Pacific as the next growth market thanks to a growing population of health-conscious consumers, he said.

Wiese was optimistic for the outlook for Europe despite gloomy economic forecasts but was cautious about the idea of snapping up cheaper assets in Britain following its June vote to leave the European Union.

"Undoubtedly it does offer opportunities but there are greater risks because none of us know how it (Brexit) is going to play out," he said. "There are studies that show that by 2040, Britain will have a bigger economy than Germany and a population of over 80 million people, that's a market you can't ignore."

POLITICAL DAMAGE

In South Africa, several businessmen, including the outspoken chief executive of gold miner Sibanye has called for President Jacob Zuma to resign after a series of scandals.

Wiese said as a businessmen rather than a politician, he would like to stay out of politics.

However, he said that the country's leadership was hurting Africa's most industrialised economy, which is expected to grow below 1 percent this year. "The top leadership in the government is seen as a problem. It is not helping our economy. That is a fact of life," he said.

But Wiese also dismissed suggestions by some analysts that he was looking to preserve his wealth by moving assets abroad during the political turbulence that has also drawn in Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan.

On the contrary, he said he expected business to continue to expand, including its interests in South Africa, with Virgin Active for example having its head office in London but earning more than 60 percent of its EBITDA, or core profit, in South Africa.

"There is no bias to disinvest - in fact the very opposite," he said.

Carrefour nega informação de que poderia sair da China, Argentina e Polônia - 路透新闻

{{20171221T164617.546+0000}}Carrefour nega informação de que poderia sair da China, Argentina e PolôniaPARIS, 21 Dez (Reuters)

Por Dominique Vidalon

PARIS, 21 Dez (Reuters) - O Carrefour negou nesta quinta-feira uma notícia de que teria dado mandato para três bancos para vender seus três bancos a vender seus negócios na China, Argentina e Polônia como parte de seu plano de reestruturação.

"Essas informações são falsas e estamos negando", disse um porta-voz do grupo, quando perguntado sobre a notícia publicada pela revista mensal francesa Capital.

O presidente-executivo, Alexandre Bompard, que assumiu o cargo em julho, revelará seu plano de reestruturação para o segundo maior varejista do mundo depois do Wal-Mart no dia 23 de janeiro. O Carrefour alertou em agosto que seu lucro operacional deste ano poderia cair em torno de 12 por cento. [nL2N1LG2AG]

Uma parceria entre o varejista francês concorrente Auchan [AUCH.UL] e a gigante da Internet Alibaba ameaça deixar o Carrefour para trás na China e pode persuadir o novo presidente a vender o negócio no país, que ainda é deficitário, disseram analistas.

Os investidores também desejam que Bompard melhore o desempenho do grupo na França, seu principal mercado, onde está perdendo participação de mercado para o rival Leclerc, e acelere a expansão do Carrefour no comércio eletrônico, onde enfrenta a concorrência da Amazon .

Os últimos números da empresa de pesquisa Kantar, para o período de 30 de outubro a 26 de novembro, mostrou que o Carrefour ainda está perdendo participação de mercado na França, enquanto o Leclerc aumentou sua presença.

Toys "R" Us plans new playdate with U.S. shoppers - 路透新闻

{{20171221T060000.000+0000}}Toys "R" Us plans new playdate with U.S. shoppersWALLKILL, NEW YORK, Dec 21 (Reuters)

By Jessica DiNapoli and Melissa Fares

WALLKILL, NEW YORK, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Joshua and Amy Hightower drive 40 minutes to a Toys "R" Us Inc store in a blue collar neighborhood in Wallkill, one of the farthest reaches of the New York City suburbs, so their children can try toys at an amusement area dubbed the "play lab."

"We were actually here last night and last week," said Amy Hightower, a 30-year-old stay-at-home mom as her daughter played house and her two sons raced cars in the play lab, which Toys "R" Us launched in 42 of its stores this year.

"It is hard to get them away from this area," she said.

The Hightowers may be ideal Toys "R" Us customers, but so far there has not been enough of them. Many shoppers now make their toy purchases online. Foot traffic at Toys "R" Us, the largest U.S. toy retailer, has declined, as consumers turn to e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com Inc , mass discount chains, like Wal-Mart Stores Inc , and some small independent toy stores.

As Toys "R" Us aims to exit bankruptcy in 2018 after defaulting on its debt last September, its efforts to reinvent its stores with play labs will shape how other retailers look to experiential shopping to tackle e-commerce.

The holiday shopping season, when 75 percent of all toy sales are made, is a key test of this strategy.

Toys "R" Us has set aside more than $400 million out of its $3.1 billion in bankruptcy loans for sprucing up its approximately 900 stores over the next three years with more experiences and better-paid staff.

The company's creditors are wary of these plans, according to sources close to the situation who requested anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations. Creditors can ask the bankruptcy judge to stop Toys "R" Us from spending on play labs or other experiential aspects, if they view the costs as excessive.

In bankruptcy court papers, Toys "R" Us has argued it cannot wait until it emerges from bankruptcy to invest in its stores. The retailer also plans to close unprofitable locations and improve its website and loyalty programs.

Dave Brandon, who became Toys "R" Us chief executive in 2015 after spearheading a turnaround at Domino's Pizza Inc , defended the strategy in an interview, saying that bricks-and-mortar stores and experiential shopping were important to the retailer's brand.

"We think our scale is a huge advantage, because we have a brand that's nationally and globally known," Brandon said.

Toys "R" Us aims to offer shopping experiences like those found at Dick's Sporting Goods Inc , Best Buy Co Inc and Ulta Beauty Inc , Brandon added.

To be sure, Toys "R" Us may end up with little to show for its investment, industry experts said. Experiential shopping is expensive to scale up for big box retailers that rely heavily on seasonal hiring, they said.

"There is a chance that Toys "R" Us could be out of business in the next two years entirely in the United States," said Stephanie Wissink, a consumer products analyst at investment bank Jefferies LLC. "My fear is that they are not selling goods to a consumer that values that experience."

Other toy retailers offering shopping experiences, such as stuffed animal shop Build-A-Bear Workshop Inc and The Lego Group have also posted sales declines. Sales at Build-A-Bear declined 7 percent to $364 million last year from $392 million two years prior.

INDEPENDENT TOY STORES

Regional independent toy retailers have also been taking market share away from Toys "R" Us, thanks to merchandise that extends beyond mass-market toys, strong customer service and products that accompany school lessons.

Those chains also seek to cater to local tastes in a way Toys "R" Us has not. "Stores in Texas buy cheerleading stuff a lot, there's a big football community," said Sharon DiMinico, chief executive of Learning Express Inc, a U.S. toy store franchiser with about 120 independently-owned stores.

Steven Aarons, the owner of four-store chain Barstons Child's Play in the Washington, D.C. area, said he is able to offer entry-level wages of $15 per hour and health insurance to full-time workers because he has cheaper rent and does not have to answer to investors.

In Wallkill, Toys "R" Us hired new employees like Nora Hanlon to oversee the store's Play Lab, which is a cordoned off foam mat, scattered with toys and a picnic table nearby where parents can sit. Boxes marked for layaway surround it.

"I get minimum wage, but it's a really fun job," said Hanlon, a high school student and part-time Play Lab Coach, sporting a reindeer headpiece.

Toys "R" Us also plans to hire more skilled workers. About $72 million of the $400 million the retailer will use for its redevelopment will go toward wage increases.

The chain's efforts to emulate features of independent stores underscores the dramatic reversal of its fortunes. As the chain grew its national footprint, it wiped out mom-and-pop shops decades ago. But its glitzy Fao Schwarz store and flagship Times Square location featuring a Ferris Wheel were too pricey.

Earlier efforts with experiential stores called "Geoffrey," named after its giraffe mascot, failed. Its $6.6 billion leveraged buyout in 2005 led to expensive interest payments that ate up cash Toys "R" Us could have used to improve stores.

"Can they somehow turn their stores from a warehouse into a play area?" said retail consultant Howard Davidowitz. "That is a big jump."

"We think our scale is a huge advantage, because we have a brand that's nationally and globally known," Brandon said.

Toys "R" Us aims to offer shopping experiences like those found at Dick's Sporting Goods Inc , Best Buy Co Inc and Ulta Beauty Inc , Brandon added.

To be sure, Toys "R" Us may end up with little to show for its investment, industry experts said. Experiential shopping is expensive to scale up for big box retailers that rely heavily on seasonal hiring, they said.

"There is a chance that Toys "R" Us could be out of business in the next two years entirely in the United States," said Stephanie Wissink, a consumer products analyst at investment bank Jefferies LLC. "My fear is that they are not selling goods to a consumer that values that experience."

Other toy retailers offering shopping experiences, such as stuffed animal shop Build-A-Bear Workshop Inc and The Lego Group have also posted sales declines. Sales at Build-A-Bear declined 7 percent to $364 million last year from $392 million two years prior.

INDEPENDENT TOY STORES

Regional independent toy retailers have also been taking market share away from Toys "R" Us, thanks to merchandise that extends beyond mass-market toys, strong customer service and products that accompany school lessons.

Those chains also seek to cater to local tastes in a way Toys "R" Us has not. "Stores in Texas buy cheerleading stuff a lot, there's a big football community," said Sharon DiMinico, chief executive of Learning Express Inc, a U.S. toy store franchiser with about 120 independently-owned stores.

Steven Aarons, the owner of four-store chain Barstons Child's Play in the Washington, D.C. area, said he is able to offer entry-level wages of $15 per hour and health insurance to full-time workers because he has cheaper rent and does not have to answer to investors.

In Wallkill, Toys "R" Us hired new employees like Nora Hanlon to oversee the store's Play Lab, which is a cordoned off foam mat, scattered with toys and a picnic table nearby where parents can sit. Boxes marked for layaway surround it.

"I get minimum wage, but it's a really fun job," said Hanlon, a high school student and part-time Play Lab Coach, sporting a reindeer headpiece.

Toys "R" Us also plans to hire more skilled workers. About $72 million of the $400 million the retailer will use for its redevelopment will go toward wage increases.

The chain's efforts to emulate features of independent stores underscores the dramatic reversal of its fortunes. As the chain grew its national footprint, it wiped out mom-and-pop shops decades ago. But its glitzy Fao Schwarz store and flagship Times Square location featuring a Ferris Wheel were too pricey.

Earlier efforts with experiential stores called "Geoffrey," named after its giraffe mascot, failed. Its $6.6 billion leveraged buyout in 2005 led to expensive interest payments that ate up cash Toys "R" Us could have used to improve stores.

"Can they somehow turn their stores from a warehouse into a play area?" said retail consultant Howard Davidowitz. "That is a big jump."

Amazon's allure may be tough to top this holiday -poll - 路透新闻

{{20171220T000000.000+0000}}Amazon's allure may be tough to top this holiday -pollCHICAGO/NEW YORK Dec 20 (Reuters)

By Richa Naidu and Chris Kahn

CHICAGO/NEW YORK Dec 20 (Reuters) - More U.S. online shoppers plan to give Amazon.com Inc the bulk of their holiday business this year than in previous years, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll, despite costly efforts by traditional retailers to attract customers to their websites.

The online poll of 2,644 adults, released on Wednesday, found that 60 percent of online shoppers planned to do most of their holiday buying on Amazon.com, up from 50 percent during the same period in 2015. Meanwhile, the proportion of shoppers who said they expected to do most of their shopping at Walmart.com, Target.com and Macys.com declined by about 1 percentage point each in that period.

Consumers opting increasingly for convenience and speedy delivery have already pushed online sales this holiday season to record highs, making it all the more crucial that retailers get their digital businesses into gear.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc , Target Corp and Macy's Inc , like many of their peers, have invested in deeper online discounts and free shipping this holiday season, potentially hurting fourth-quarter profit margins to win back customers who have turned increasingly to Amazon.com.

Retailers have also invested heavily in sprucing up their websites and mobile device apps. They are rolling out more fulfillment options such as curbside pickup, click-and-collect and same-day delivery. The holiday shopping season can account for 20 to 40 percent of annual sales for many retailers.

Anand Raghuraman, EY's Americas leader for consumer products and retail strategy, said traditional retailers' online sales were growing, but not fast enough to win market share.

"They're dealing with an 800-pound gorilla that has different metrics around profitability than they do, which is tough to compete with," said Raghuraman.

Earnest Research, which looks at anonymous card transactions made by millions of U.S. shoppers, said data from the two weeks after Thanksgiving showed Amazon's market share of U.S. sales had risen 2.6 percent from the same period last year.

Meanwhile Walmart's in-store and online market share for the period was down 1.7 percent, while Target had lost 0.6 percent and Macy's was down 0.5 percent, according to Earnest.

Target expects fourth-quarter digital growth to once again be among the best in the industry, spokesman Joshua Thomas said. Macy's spokeswoman Radina Russell said the department store chain had begun the holiday season well and would continue to offer value online and in stores.

Walmart did not immediately provide comment.

To be sure, analytics firms and industry groups expect most traditional retailers to report higher holiday sales this year, both online and in stores, driven by discounting, low unemployment, rising consumer confidence and good weather across the country.

Sales on Thanksgiving and Black Friday also topped prior years and Amazon.com said it broke sales records during that holiday weekend.

According to the Reuters/Ipsos poll, about one in every four adults plan to shop primarily or entirely online this holiday season, up from one in five in 2012. Convenience, delivery and the ability to compare prices easily were the most common reasons people choose to shop online, the poll showed.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted in English throughout the United States from Nov. 27 to Dec. 7. Because it is an online poll, the respondents may be more experienced with computers and online shopping than the general public. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 2 percentage points.

POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street recule, incertitudes sur l'impact de la réforme - 路透新闻

{{20171219T233122.350+0000}}POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street recule, incertitudes sur l'impact de la réformeNEW YORK, 20 décembre (Reuters)

(Actualisé avec précisions, commentaires, pétrole et volume)

* La Chambre des représentants adopte le projet de réforme fiscale

* Le texte était en débat au Sénat au moment de la clôture

* La Chambre pourrait être obligée de revoter mercredi

* Apple baisse, Wal-Mart monte, sur des commentaires de brokers

* Le Dow a perdu 0,15%, le S&P 0,32% et le Nasdaq 0,44%

par April Joyner

NEW YORK, 20 décembre (Reuters) - La Bourse de New York a fini en léger repli mardi, l'optimisme concernant la réforme fiscale en passe d'être adoptée par le Congrès ayant cédé la place à l'inquiétude quant à son impact sur la politique monétaire de la Fed et l'évolution des taux.

L'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> a cédé 37,45 points en clôture, soit 0,15%, à 24.754,75. Le S&P-500 <.SPX>, plus large, a perdu 8,69 points, soit 0,32%, à 2.681,47. Le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> a reculé de son côté de 39,91 points (-0,44%) à 6.963,85 points.

La Chambre des représentants américains a approuvé mardi par 227 voix contre 203 le projet de réforme fiscale voulu par le président Donald Trump. Douze représentants républicains ont voté contre, ainsi que 191 des 193 élus démocrates. [nL8N1OJ5IS]

Mais le Sénat, qui doit voter sur le texte dans la nuit, a rejeté mardi trois dispositions du projet, ce qui pourrait obliger la Chambre à revoter mercredi. [nL8N1OJ63A] [nL8N1OJ61A]

Wall Street a accentué ses pertes en fin de séance suite au vote de la Chambre, après des semaines de hausse dans l'espoir que les baisses d'impôts dopent les profits et la croissance. Certains investisseurs notent qu'une bonne partie des bénéfices à tirer de la réforme sont déjà inscrits dans les cours.

La promesse d'une réforme fiscale aura été en 2017 l'un des principaux moteurs de la progression de Wall Street, dont l'indice S&P 500 <.SPX> a pris 20,18% à la clôture de lundi.

"Les taux d'imposition ont sans aucun doute été intégrés dans les cours", souligne Jack Ablin, responsable de l'investissement chez BMO Private Bank. il se peut aussi que les investisseurs "saluent la réforme fiscale tout en reconnaissant que ce que les banques centrales nous ont donné ces dernières années, elles pourraient commencer à nous le reprendre."

HAUSSE DES RENDEMENTS

Cette réforme prévoit notamment un taux d'imposition sur les bénéfices de 21% pour les sociétés, contre 35% actuellement, et un taux maximal de 37% pour les particuliers au lieu de 39,6%.

Elle devrait ajouter 1.500 milliards de dollars (près de 1.300 euros) sur dix ans au déficit budgétaire des Etats-Unis, déjà estimé à 20.000 milliards sur la même période.

Le dollar a progressé face à la plupart des devises, soutenu en cours de séance par une hausse inattendue des mises en chantier [nL8N1O13X2]. Mais ses gains ont été limités par les doutes concernant l'impact de la réforme fiscale sur l'économie.

Les rendements des obligations du Trésor ont atteint des pics de sept semaines, dopés dans un premier temps par les mises en chantier, puis par l'adoption par la Chambre de la plus profonde refonte de la fiscalité américaine en plus de 30 ans. "Certains peuvent craindre que le coup de pouce fiscal ne soit contrebalancé par un resserrement monétaire", dit Jacques Ablin.

Le courant de ventes sur les obligations souveraines américaines est aussi le résultat de prises de profits après une tendance à l'aplatissement de la courbe des taux depuis deux jours et de la perspective d'une augmentation du déficit public.

L'or a reculé avec la hausse des rendements.

A Wall Street, Apple a cédé 1,07%. Investec a ramené son conseil d'"acheter" à "neutre" et son objectif de cours de 185 à 175 dollars. Il juge que l'équilibre de l'offre et de la demande pour l'iPhone X laisse peu de marge pour un relèvement des prévisions de ventes du prochain trimestre.

L'indice S&P sectoriel des valeurs technologiques <.SPLRCT> a perdu 0,53%, plus gros poids sur les grands indices.

Wal-Mart en revanche a gagné 0,92% à la suite du relèvement de la recommandation de Citigroup sur l'action, passé à l'achat sur le numéro un mondial de la grande distribution.

Le volume s'est élevé mardi à 6,5 milliards de titres, contre 6,8 milliards en moyenne sur les 20 dernières séances.

Le pétrole a accentué ses gains, avec un baril de Brent près des 64 dollars, encore soutenu par la fermeture de l'oléoduc de Forties en mer du Nord, mais aussi par des chiffres indiquant une baisse inattendue des stocks américains de brut.

ACTUALIZA 1-Banco Bci acuerda compra de negocio financiero de Walmart en Chile por 148 mln dlr - 路透新闻

{{20171219T194038.603+0000}}ACTUALIZA 1-Banco Bci acuerda compra de negocio financiero de Walmart en Chile por 148 mln dlrSANTIAGO, 19 dic (Reuters)

(Agrega detalles, citas, acciones)

SANTIAGO, 19 dic (Reuters) - El Banco de Crédito e Inversiones (Bci) informó el martes que llegó a un acuerdo para adquirir el negocio financiero de la minorista Walmart en Chile, una transacción que alcanzaría los 148 millones de dólares.

Bci , que tiene su sede en Santiago, dijo al supervisor de valores local que la operación con la filial de la gigante minorista estadounidense Wal-Mart requiere la aprobación de los reguladores y se cerraría durante 2018.

"El negocio se desarrollará en el marco de un acuerdo de cooperación comercial de largo plazo entre Bci y Walmart", dijo el banco en un comunicado.

Las partes habían anunciado el inicio de negociaciones en septiembre.[nL2N1LV1RI]

Walmart Chile es el principal operador de supermercados del país con más de 370 locales de las cadenas Lider, Ekono, SuperBodega, aCuenta y Central Mayorista.

La división de Servicios Financieros de la minorista ofrece crédito a clientes a través de las tarjetas Lider MasterCard y Presto, además de otros productos como avances en efectivo y seguros personales.

"La adquisición nos permitirá aumentar la participación de mercado en tarjetas de crédito, subiendo del 8 por ciento al 18 por ciento, en línea con el plan definido", dijo Eugenio Von Chrismar, gerente general de Bci.

La adquisición del negocio financiero de Walmart Chile se suma a la reciente compra del banco estadounidense Totalbank, por el que Bci pagó 528 millones de dólares.[nL1N1O10L2]

A septiembre, Walmart Chile contaba con casi 1,5 millones de tarjetas operativas, una cartera de crédito equivalente a unos 830 millones de dólares y 127 sucursales al interior de los supermercados.

La transacción ocurre tres años después de que la rival Cencosud , una de las mayores minoristas de América Latina, acordó ceder su negocio financiero en Chile al canadiense Scotiabank por 280 millones de dólares.

Tras el anuncio, las acciones de Bci caían un 2,35 por ciento a 41.355 pesos en la Bolsa de Santiago.

{{20171219T152629.074+0000}}USA-Les valeurs à suivre à Wall Street (actualisé)NEW YORK, 19 décembre (Reuters)

* APPLE - Instinet a abaissé sa recommandation à "neutre" contre "acheter" et ramené son objectif de cours à 175 dollars contre 185 en expliquant s'interroger sur le potentiel de croissance des ventes de l'iPhone X. L'action perdait 0,8% en avant-Bourse.

* FACEBOOK - Les autorités de la concurrence allemandes accusent Facebook d'abuser de sa position dans les conclusions préliminaires d'une enquête de plus d'un an et demi. Leur décision définitive est attendue au début de l'été 2018. [nL8N1OJ2FU]

POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street ouvre sur une note prudente en attendant le Congrès - 路透新闻

{{20171219T152628.318+0000}}POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street ouvre sur une note prudente en attendant le Congrès19 décembre (Reuters)

* Le Dow et le S&P en légère hausse, le Nasdaq en baisse

* Le Congrès pourrait voter la réforme fiscale dans la journée

* Wall Street évolue déjà sur des plus hauts historiques

* Le dollar baisse

* Les rendements obligataires montent après les mises en chantier

19 décembre (Reuters) - La Bourse de New York évolue sans grand changement en début de séance mardi au lendemain de nouveaux records et dans l'attente de l'adoption du projet de réforme fiscale lancé par Donald Trump.

Quelques minutes après le début des échanges, l'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> gagne 21,66 points, soit 0,09%, à 24.813,86 points. Le Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX>, plus large, progresse de 0,05% à 2.691,52 points tandis que le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> cède 0,09% à 6.988,15 points.

La Chambre des représentants devrait se prononcer à partir de 18h30 GMT sur le projet de réforme fiscale, présenté comme le plus ambitieux amorcé aux Etats-Unis depuis plus de 30 ans, et le Sénat pourrait voter quelques heures plus tard, ce qui permettrait au président de le promulguer avant la fin de la semaine.

Les derniers doutes sur la possibilité d'une adoption rapide ont été levés lundi par le ralliement au texte de deux sénateurs jusqu'à présent indécis. [nL8N1OI5UZ]

Considérant donc le vote du Congrès comme pratiquement acquis, les analystes s'attachent désormais à évaluer les conséquences de la réforme sur les résultats des sociétés cotées.

Mizuho, dans une note consacrée au secteur de l'assurance santé, explique ainsi que "la réforme fiscale devrait avoir un impact positif en matière de cash-flow, notamment pour les entreprises de services de santé qui ont généralement une exposition internationale limitée et des investissements en capital fixe importants".

WAL-MART MONTE, APPLE CÈDE DU TERRAIN

L'intermédiaire cite parmi les bénéficiaires potentiels dans le secteur CVS et Express Scripts , qui gagnent respectivement 0,78% et 0,75%.

Au sein du Dow Jones, Wal-Mart gagne 1,53% après le relèvement de la recommandation de Citigroup, passé à l'achat sur le numéro un mondial de la grande distribution.

A la baisse, Apple abandonne 0,9%. Investec a ramené son conseil d'"acheter" à "neutre" et son objectif de cours de 185 à 175 dollars.

Au moment de l'ouverture de Wall Street, les principales Bourses de la zone euro évoluaient dans le rouge, l'indice Stoxx 600 <.STOXX> perdant 0,14% tandis que le CAC 40 <.FCHI> à Paris cédait 0,19%.

Sur le marché des changes, le dollar réduisait alors ses pertes face à un panier de devises de référence et l'euro se traitait autour de 1,1820 dollar , en hausse de 0,33%.

Le billet vert profite entre autres de la remontée des rendements des Treasuries (le dix ans est repassé à plus de 2,428% contre 2,392% quelques minutes plus tôt) après les chiffres mensuels de la construction neuve aux Etats-Unis, marqués par une hausse inattendue des mises en chantier [nL8N1O13X2].

Suivant le mouvement, les rendements allemand et français à dix ans se sont eux aussi orientés à la hausse, à près de 0,36% pour le Bund et 0,687% pour l'OAT .

By Sruthi Shankar

Dec 19 (Reuters) - Wall Street's major indexes were poised to inch higher at the open on Tuesday, building on strong gains in the past two sessions on rising hopes that the U.S. Congress will vote in favor of the proposed tax overhaul.

The House of Representatives will vote on the bill on Tuesday afternoon, followed by the Senate later in the night or on Wednesday morning. The bill will likely be signed into law by the end of the week. [nL1N1OJ00O]

"There's still strong belief that it's going to happen. But the market is not going to completely relax until they get done," said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida.

The overhaul would cut corporate tax rates to 21 percent from 35 percent, which investors are betting will boost profits as well as trigger share buybacks and higher dividend payouts.

Those hopes have spurred a rally in the major Wall Street indexes this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI>, S&P 500 <.SPX>, Nasdaq <.IXIC> and the small-cap Russell 2000 <.RUT> ended at record highs on Monday.

The Nasdaq briefly topped 7,000 points for the first time and the Dow closed 208 points shy of the 25,000-point mark.

At 8:26 a.m. ET (1326 GMT), S&P 500 e-minis were up 3 points, or 0.11 percent, with 87 contracts changing hands and Dow e-minis <1YMc2> were up 45 points, or 0.18 percent, with 30 contracts changing hands.

Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 1 point, or 0.02 percent, in volume of 26 contracts.

Another expected outcome of lower taxes is cash repatriation. That, along with a modest rise in interest rates, will leave a lot of cash on corporate balance sheets, which makes a "very strong market for M&A," said Brown.

After a spate of dealmaking on Monday, Tuesday kicked off with health insurer Humana's $4.1 billion, or $9 per share, offer for Kindred Healthcare . [nL4N1OJ3WJ]

Kindred's shares fell 5.8 percent to $8.95, from its close of $9.50 after a run-up on media reports of a deal. Humana shares were flat.

Apple dipped 0.8 percent after brokerage Instinet downgraded the stock to "neutral" on expectations of a limited upside to iPhone X sales next quarter. [nL4N1OJ2G5]

Wal-Mart jumped 1.28 percent after Citi upgraded the stock to "buy", on expectations of the stock will rise further in 2018. The stock has gained about 42 percent so far this year, which is its best since 1999. [nL4N1OJ3VZ]

GM rose about 1.3 percent after RBC upgraded the automaker's stock to "outperform" on expectations of better profitability in 2018. [nL4N1OJ2T0]

Darden Restaurants was up 2.3 percent, the top gainer among S&P 500 stocks trading premarket, after reporting upbeat quarterly results. [nL4N1OJ3Q7]

Navistar International gained more than 9 percent as higher demand for its buses and trucks drove its quarterly results. [nL4N1OJ3QT]

To thwart Amazon, Kroger and Walmart lure shoppers with curbside pickup - Reuters News

{{20171218T081003.995+0000}}To thwart Amazon, Kroger and Walmart lure shoppers with curbside pickupLOS ANGELES, Dec 18 (Reuters)

By Lisa Baertlein

LOS ANGELES, Dec 18 (Reuters) - As Amazon.com looks to upend the U.S. grocery market with home delivery, some veteran supermarket operators are betting on a different strategy: curbside pickup.

Americans have long loved the convenience of drive-through service for burgers and coffee. Kroger Co and Walmart Inc are tweaking that formula for groceries.

The companies have invested heavily in online systems that allow customers to order ahead from their neighborhood store. Workers pick and pack the products, then run them out to shoppers in the parking lot, the grocery version of carry out pizza.

For the retailers, the service is cheaper than delivery, because customers do the driving. For shoppers, it means skipping crowds and queues at their local market, and no worries about missing packages or melted ice cream if they are not at home to meet the delivery guy.

Tony Sacco, who lives in the Los Angeles beach community of Playa Del Rey, is a regular user of the service at a nearby Ralphs supermarket, owned by Cincinnati-based Kroger. Each pickup costs $6.95, but the time-crunched married father of three says it is worth it.

"This is easy. Time is money," said Sacco, 47, as a worker loaded bags into his SUV on a recent morning.

Retaining customers like Sacco is critical for traditional grocery retailers as they battle an array of upstarts bent on turning groceries into the next home-delivery juggernaut.

New entrants such as meal-kit company Blue Apron and organic food seller Thrive Market are peeling off coveted slices of their business. Amazon , the nation's largest online retailer, has amassed an 18 percent share of the $12.6 billion U.S. online grocery market mainly through the sale of packaged goods such as pasta and diapers. It is the largest player in a sector that is expected to grow to $41.7 billion by 2022, according to market research firm Packaged Facts.

(For a graphic on U.S. online grocery sales, see http://tmsnrt.rs/2kwT9OU)

But even mighty Amazon has struggled with the trickiest part of the trade: delivering fresh produce, meat, dairy and other perishables. Its AmazonFresh service started more than a decade ago, but has yet to make a major mark.

Amazon is making another run at it with its $13.7 billion purchase of upscale grocery chain Whole Foods earlier this year. Amazon has said little about its plans. But analysts expect it will use Whole Foods' 450 locations as distribution hubs for home delivery, opening a new front in its campaign to disrupt the $700-billion U.S. grocery industry. Old-line players are responding with some new moves of their own. Kroger and Walmart are experimenting with delivery. But they are wagering that pickup is the true sweet spot in the industry's online evolution. Both are rolling out the service in thousands of their stores.

"The way people are going to shop for groceries is going to be curbside, not delivery," said Jason Goldberg, a senior vice president at digital marketing firm SapientRazorfish.

Amazon, too, is eyeing that channel. AmazonFresh has already tested pickup in Seattle and analysts expect Whole Foods to do the same.

Nevertheless, researcher Packaged Facts says traditional retailers can win with real estate: "Companies such as Walmart and Kroger have the advantage, because they already have stores all over the country in both urban and rural settings," it said in a recent report.

CLICK AND COLLECT

Kroger bought its way into pickup with its 2014 purchase of southeast grocer Harris Teeter, which had an established program.

That same year, Kroger debuted its own offering, known as ClickList, adding features such as coupons and promotions based on detailed customer data.

Pickup is now available at 1,000 of the chain's 2,800 stores and the company is adding the service at 400 to 500 locations a year, according to Matt Thompson, the vice president of ClickList.

He said curbside customers spend 40 percent to 60 percent more than traditional shoppers, because they tend to stock up on bulky items such as bottled water.

Users pay $4.95 to $6.95 for each order depending on their location. Kroger would not disclose how many shoppers use ClickList. It promotes the service in stores and online, while customers spread the word through social media.

Users log into ClickList online. They put items into digital carts, pay and reserve a pickup time at least four hours in advance.

The order is sent to a terminal in a store's dedicated ClickList room, where "pickers" are dispatched with handheld devices that tell them exactly where to find each item. These workers bag the products and put them into labeled bins; perishables are kept in a nearby freezer or fridge. When customers pull into designated pickup parking spaces, they are directed to call a number to alert a ClickList staffer, who wheels the bags to their cars.

Kroger gave Reuters a tour of its ClickList operation at a Ralphs supermarket in Los Angeles' Westchester neighborhood in late November.

Miguel Lopez, who leads the ClickList team there, said it takes about 30 minutes to pick a $100 order; a $400 order takes an hour. The team tracks progress on a white board that showed weekly progress since the service debuted in January. The number of daily orders ranged from 13 to 36. Sales for the week Reuters visited, which included Thanksgiving Day, were on pace to hit a record of more than $12,000.

Analysts say typical Kroger stores have annual sales of around $30 million, excluding gasoline. Deutsche Bank analyst Shane Higgins said pickup already accounts for over 5 percent of sales in some locations.

Kroger declined to comment on the overall performance of ClickList but acknowledged costs are initially higher for pickup orders because of the additional labor involved. Company executives said increasing sales and efficiency can virtually eliminate that gap in as little as three years.

Another challenge to profitability is that pickup customers are not tempted by in-store impulse items. But the biggest risk, analysts say, is to do nothing and let customers drift to competitors that offer the service.

Shopper Kimberlee Isaacs says ClickList has kept her loyal to the Westchester Ralphs, where she drops $800 a month on groceries for her family of three.

"We use it every single week. I don't go into the store unless I forgot something," Isaacs, 50, said.

COMING ON STRONG

Meanwhile, Walmart, the nation's top grocery seller, aims to add free curbside pickup at 1,000 stores next year, bringing the total to 2,100 of its 4,700 U.S. locations.

It declined to discuss profitability of the service. But spokeswoman Molly Blakeman said the company decided to expand it quickly based on encouraging results.

Pickup is winning converts such as Hudson, Florida shopper Steve Mondock, who had previously shunned Walmart.

"I hated the crowds, I hated the parking," said Mondock, 55, who now buys most of his basics there.

Virtually every food retailer is now testing or adding pickup, including Publix, HEB, Meijer and Safeway. Target Corp , which just bought delivery company Shipt, is testing drive up for non-perishable groceries and other items.

"That's why you want to be early so you can capture someone else's customers," said Loop Capital analyst Andrew Wolf.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Li & Fung family rearranges its sweater drawer - 路透新闻

{{20171215T102121.474+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Li & Fung family rearranges its sweater drawerHONG KONG, Dec 15 (Reuters Breakingviews)

(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Jeffrey Goldfarb

HONG KONG, Dec 15 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Sometimes the solution to a problem can be right in the mirror. The family behind Li & Fung <0494.HK> is counting on it. The Hong Kong supply-chain conglomerate, which helps retailers like Walmart stock their shelves, is selling its struggling sweaters, furniture and beauty products divisions for $1.1 billion to a group led by the Fung clan itself.

Li & Fung, which started exporting porcelain and fireworks from Guangzhou to the United States back in 1906, has found its middle-man role under increasing threat from the likes of Alibaba . Consumers nowadays can be connected directly to manufacturers across China and beyond. Part of Li & Fung's response has been to embark on a three-year plan to digitize its business by using predictive analytics and also to make everything faster by 2019.

The company has been offloading businesses, too. The products whose divestiture was announced on Thursday have weighed the group down. The Li & Fung division that houses them, which accounts for about a fifth of group sales, suffered a 29 percent decline in core operating profit in the first half of the year. The deal will lead to a $610 million loss because of related writedowns, but it will also provide the company with some financial firepower as it implements its strategic plan.

Nearly half the proceeds have, however, been promised to Li & Fung shareholders as a special dividend. About $170 million of that would wind up back in the pockets of the Fungs, who own a third of the company. That will come in handy as they buy the three product lines. Their investment firms will hold 55 percent of the acquired businesses, for an implied stake value of about $600 million. Buyout shop Hony Capital, owner of Pizza Express and other companies, will have the rest.

The transaction values the sweaters-to-cosmetics enterprise at nearly 15 times earnings before interest and taxes. That's a healthy multiple for an operation in decline. Li & Fung stock jumped almost 9 percent on the news, suggesting it's not a deal that's too cozy. A majority of non-family shareholders also will be needed to sign off on the sale.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Target needs more than Shipt to fend off Amazon - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20171214T182935.634+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Target needs more than Shipt to fend off AmazonNEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters Breakingviews)

(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Christopher Beddor

NEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Target will need more than Shipt to fend off Amazon and Walmart . The $34 billion retailer said on Wednesday that it would buy the upstart grocery-delivery platform for $550 million. That's a step in the right direction to leverage its brick-and-mortar shops in an online world. But it will need to do much more to escape the squeeze of the e-commerce juggernauts.

Alabama-based Shipt manages more than 20,000 "personal shoppers" who retrieve groceries from local stores and deliver them to customers' homes. The acquisition should allow Target to compete with Amazon, at least on speed, by turning its retail stores into an ersatz network of warehouses. Shipt might also bring down the retailer's high e-commerce fulfillment costs, which it has flagged as a pressure on profitability.

Investors greeted the news with enthusiasm: Target's share price rose nearly 2 percent, adding almost $600 million to the company's value. But it comes after a rough year for shareholders. Target's stock is down 13 percent this year, even as Walmart and Amazon have surged 41 percent and 57 percent, respectively.

Target has lagged its larger bricks-and-mortar rival in moving online. Walmart's U.S. e-commerce sales grew 50 percent in the latest quarter, pushing its overall top-line comparable sales in the United States to 2.7 percent. By contrast, Target's digital-channel sales increased 24 percent in the same period. It expects full-year sales growth to range from flat to 1 percent.

More broadly, the "Beast of Bentonville" and "Death Star" (as Liberty Media's John Malone recently dubbed Amazon) are moving fast and breaking things in Target's backyard. Amazon moved into the grocery business this year with its acquisition of Whole Foods, while last year Walmart purchased Jet.com, a direct e-commerce competitor to Amazon. This year it snapped up companies ranging from men's fashion (Bonobos) to shoes (ShoeBuy) and delivery (Parcel).

Target's Shipt deal, along with its purchase of the transportation-technology company Grand Junction in August, is small by comparison. It has other initiatives in the works, such as Target Restock, a pilot next-day delivery service for home essentials. But the Minneapolis-based retailer's need to become more aggressive to keep pace in the cutthroat retail market lingers as an investment risk.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Target on Dec. 13 said it would acquire Shipt, an online grocery-delivery platform, for $550 million in cash. The e-commerce firm has more than 20,000 "personal shoppers" who retrieve items in stores and deliver them to customers, who pay an annual fee of $99 for unlimited deliveries.

- Target says its acquisition of Shipt will bring same-day delivery services for groceries, essentials, home products, electronics and other items to around half its stores by early 2018. The company says it will offer same-day delivery on all products by the end of 2019.

UPDATE 1-PepsiCo makes biggest public pre-order of Tesla Semis: 100 trucks - 路透新闻

{{20171212T180017.108+0000}}UPDATE 1-PepsiCo makes biggest public pre-order of Tesla Semis: 100 trucks(Updates pre-order tally, paragraph 6; adds details on other electric trucks, paragraph 4)

By Eric M. Johnson

SEATTLE, Dec 12 (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc has reserved 100 of Tesla Inc's new electric Semi trucks, the largest known order of the big rig, as the maker of Mountain Dew soda and Doritos chips seeks to reduce fuel costs and fleet emissions, a company executive said on Tuesday.

Tesla has been trying to convince the trucking community that it can build an affordable electric big rig with the range and cargo capacity to compete with relatively low-cost, time-tested diesel trucks.

Several transportation firms are holding off on the Tesla for now, citing uncertainty over the time it takes to recharge compared to a diesel fill-up, range, and payload capabilities and how the market for electric commercial vehicles will develop. [nL3N1NN3V7] [nL1N1NM1N4]

About 260,000 heavy-duty Class-8 trucks are produced in North America annually, according to FTR, an industry economics research firm.

Navistar International Corp and Volkswagen AG's Truck and Bus are working to launch an electric medium duty truck by late 2019, while rival Daimler AG has delivered the first of a smaller range of electric trucks to customers in New York. [nL2N1LV11Y]

PepsiCo's 100 trucks add to orders by more than a dozen companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc , fleet operator J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc , and food service distribution company Sysco Corp . Tesla has at least 285 truck reservations in hand, according to a Reuters tally.

PepsiCo intends to deploy Tesla Semis for shipments of snack foods and beverages between manufacturing and distribution facilities and direct to retailers within the 500-mile (800-km) range promised by Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk.

The semi-trucks will complement PepsiCo's U.S. fleet of nearly 10,000 big rigs and are a key part of its plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across its supply chain by a total of at least 20 percent by 2030, said Mike O'Connell, senior director of North American supply chain for PepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay.

PepsiCo is analyzing what routes are best for its Tesla trucks but sees a wide range of uses for lighter loads like snacks or shorter shipments of heavier beverages, O'Connell said.

Tesla declined to comment on its customers and potential customers to date.

Tesla unveiled the Semi last month and expects the truck to be in production by 2019.

O'Connell declined to say how much PepsiCo paid to reserve its trucks, when it placed the order, or whether it plans to lease the trucks or buy them outright. Tesla initially asked $5,000 per truck for pre-orders but that amount has since risen to about $20,000.

Navistar International Corp and Volkswagen AG's Truck and Bus are working to launch an electric medium duty truck by late 2019, while rival Daimler AG has delivered the first of a smaller range of electric trucks to customers in New York. [nL2N1LV11Y]

PepsiCo's 100 trucks add to orders by more than a dozen companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc , fleet operator J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc , and food service distribution company Sysco Corp . Tesla has at least 285 truck reservations in hand, according to a Reuters tally.

PepsiCo intends to deploy Tesla Semis for shipments of snack foods and beverages between manufacturing and distribution facilities and direct to retailers within the 500-mile (800-km) range promised by Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk.

The semi-trucks will complement PepsiCo's U.S. fleet of nearly 10,000 big rigs and are a key part of its plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across its supply chain by a total of at least 20 percent by 2030, said Mike O'Connell, senior director of North American supply chain for PepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay.

PepsiCo is analyzing what routes are best for its Tesla trucks but sees a wide range of uses for lighter loads like snacks or shorter shipments of heavier beverages, O'Connell said.

Tesla declined to comment on its customers and potential customers to date.

Tesla unveiled the Semi last month and expects the truck to be in production by 2019.

O'Connell declined to say how much PepsiCo paid to reserve its trucks, when it placed the order, or whether it plans to lease the trucks or buy them outright. Tesla initially asked $5,000 per truck for pre-orders but that amount has since risen to about $20,000.

PepsiCo faz maior encomenda antecipada de caminhões da Tesla até o momento - 路透新闻

{{20171212T165908.880+0000}}PepsiCo faz maior encomenda antecipada de caminhões da Tesla até o momentoSEATTLE, 12 Dez (Reuters) - A PepsiCo encomendou 100 unidades do novo caminhão elétrico da Tesla , o Semi, no maior pedido até agora conhecido do novo modelo, com a fabricante do refrigerante Mountain Dew e do salgadinho Doritos buscando reduzir os custos com combustíveis e a emissão de suas frotas, disse um executivo da companhia nesta terça-feira.

A Tesla tem tentado convencer o setor de transporte por caminhão de que pode construir modelos elétricos de grande porte com preços acessíveis, a autonomia de bateria e capacidade de carga para competir com os caminhões de relativo baixo custo a diesel.

Pedidos antecipados refletem a incerteza sobre como o mercado de veículos elétricos comerciais se desenvolverá. Cerca de 260 mil caminhões de grande porte são produzidos na América do Norte anualmente, de acordo com a FTR, empresa de pesquisas econômicas do setor.

Os 100 caminhões da PepsiCo se somam aos pedidos de mais de uma dúzia de empresas, como Wal-Mart , a operadora de frotas J.B. Hunt Transport Services e a companhia de distribuição de alimentos Sysco . As encomendas de caminhões da Tesla somam até o momento 267 caminhões, de acordo com contagem da Reuters.

Os caminhões Semi complementarão a frota norte-americana da PepsiCo, de quase 10 mil caminhões de grande porte e são parte fundamental no plano da empresa para reduzir as emissões de gases do efeito estufa ao longo de sua cadeia de produção, em um total de pelo menos 20 por cento até 2030, disse Mike O'Connell, diretor sênior da cadeia de fornecimento para América do Norte da Frito-Lay, subsidiária da PepsiCo.

Tesla revelou o caminhão Semi no mês passado e espera que o veículo esteja em produção até 2019.

O'Connell não quis dizer quanto a PepsiCo pagou para encomendar seus caminhões quando fez os pedidos antecipados, ou se planeja alugá-los ou comprá-los. A Tesla inicialmente pedia 5 mil dólares por pré-encomenda de caminhão, mas essa quantia subiu para 20 mil dólares desde então.

A Tesla não respondeu imediatamente a um pedido de comentários.

Irish start-up helps local shops compete with online giants - 路透新闻

{{20171212T134441.781+0000}}Irish start-up helps local shops compete with online giantsBy Jamillah Knowles

LONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Pointy, a Dublin-based firm with Silicon Valley backers, is solving the problem of how to make it easier for people to find products they want close to home, as shopping online gets easier but locating what you want locally remains elusive.

"Someone could just walk down the street and pick (an item) up, but that information is just frustratingly difficult to find," Pointy Co-Founder and Chief Executive Mark Cummins said.

"Retailers are losing out and those sales are going away to Amazon or they're going away to even a larger brick-and-mortar retailer," he said in a video-link interview from Dublin, where Cummins estimates that 14 percent of the city's retailers have adopted the Pointy service.

Only a handful of the world's largest retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores offer consumers the ability to search local store shelves online, after massive investments in inventory stocking systems to provide this data.

Pointy's device plugs into barcode scanners at retail checkouts and captures product data when consumers shop, creating a map of what is selling from the store's inventory.

This allows retailers to feature what they have on their shelves in local online search results. Pointy also creates and hosts websites for businesses to feature what they have in stock.

"Pointy creates the data feed for the store, which the retailer can then use to integrate with other services such as Google Shopping," Cummins said.

Three-year-old Pointy has moved into individual stores and small chains across the United States and this month began expanding into Canada from its Dublin base.

It is also working on greater integration with Google, Cummins said, building on ties he has after the Silicon Valley search giant made its first ever UK acquisition in 2010 by buying his machine vision start-up Plink.

Pointy aims to help rival national chains, or even the smallest retailers, compete with tools to draw online consumers into their stores.

In September, the company said it had raised $6 million in funding from tech entrepreneurs including Lars Rasmussen, a co-creator of Google Maps, Matt Mullenweg, who developed WordPress blogging software and Taavet Hinrikus, co-founder of money transfer service Transferwise.

PepsiCo passe une précommande de 100 camions électriques à Tesla - 路透新闻

{{20171212T125608.268+0000}}PepsiCo passe une précommande de 100 camions électriques à TeslaSEATTLE, 12 décembre (Reuters) - PepsiCo a réservé 100 semi-remorques électriques Semi de Tesla , la plus importante précommande sur ce modèle à ce jour, le groupe agroalimentaire américain cherchant à réduire ses coûts en carburant, ainsi que les émissions polluantes de sa flotte, a annoncé lundi un responsable du groupe.

Le constructeur américain de véhicules électriques tente de convaincre le secteur qu'il peut produire un camion électrique à un prix abordable, susceptible de rivaliser avec les modèles diesel éprouvés et relativement bon marché.

La commande de PepsiCo s'ajoute aux commandes déjà passées par une douzaine de groupes comme Wal-Mart Stores , l'opérateur de flotte J.B. Hunt Transport Services et la société de distribution alimentaire Sysco .

Selon un décompte Reuters, Tesla a enregistré à ce jour 267 réservations pour son camion Semi, présenté le mois dernier et qui devrait entrer en production d'ici 2019. [nL8N1NN0KF]

PepsiCo dispose d'une flotte de près de 10.000 camions et la commande à Tesla s'inscrit dans son plan de réduction d'au moins 20% des émissions de gaz à effet de serre dans sa chaîne logistique d'ici 2030, a dit Mike O'Connell, le directeur de la logistique en Amérique du Nord de Frito-Lay, filiale de PepsiCo.

Tesla n'a pas répondu dans l'immédiat à une demande de commentaire.

** "Tempering our enthusiasm are WMT's modest 5 pct earnings growth relative to its 20-21x multiple and the possibility that same-store sales improvement levels off in 2018," MS says

** MS says WMT will be among the "fewer but bigger winners" in retail, calls it among the best positioned omni-channel players in the world

** But MS says cannot rate WMT "outperform" as the bull case – comps north of 2.5 pct and MSD/HSD margins – seems a stretch

** Says gross margins may recede over time via price investments, but gross profit dollar growth and cost discipline will reignite the productivity loop while protecting margins

** MS says Wal-Mart can offer a superior value than Amazon Prime given its mentality not to be beaten on price and grocery/fresh offering, supply chain, jet.com capabilities

** WMT could grind higher, says MS, but may tread water as it digests recent gains (up 40 pct YTD vs 18.8 pct rise in S&P 500 and 9.3 pct gain in S&P consumer staples <.SPLRCS>)

** MS stayed "equal-weight" on WMT through 2017, while its PT has risen 43 pct – from $70 to $100

PepsiCo makes biggest public pre-order of Tesla Semis: 100 trucks - 路透新闻

{{20171212T120004.205+0000}}PepsiCo makes biggest public pre-order of Tesla Semis: 100 trucksBy Eric M. Johnson

SEATTLE, Dec 12 (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc has reserved 100 of Tesla Inc's new electric Semi trucks, the largest-known order of the big rig, as the maker of Mountain Dew soda and Doritos chips seeks to reduce fuel costs and fleet emissions, a company executive said on Tuesday.

Tesla has been trying to convince the trucking community that it can build an affordable electric big rig with the range and cargo capacity to compete with relatively low-cost, time-tested diesel trucks.

Early orders reflect uncertainty over how the market for electric commercial vehicles will develop. About 260,000 heavy-duty Class-8 trucks are produced in North America annually, according to FTR, an industry economics research firm.

PepsiCo's 100 trucks add to orders by more than a dozen companies such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc , fleet operator J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc , and foodservice distribution company Sysco Corp . Reservations to date are at 267 Tesla trucks, according to a Reuters tally. [nL3N1NN3V7]

PepsiCo intends to deploy Tesla Semis for shipments of snack foods and beverages between manufacturing and distribution facilities and direct to retailers within the 500-mile (800-km) range promised by Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk.

The semi-trucks will complement PepsiCo's U.S. fleet of nearly 10,000 big rigs and are a key part of its plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across its supply chain by a total of at least 20 percent by 2030, said Mike O'Connell, the senior director of North American supply chain for PepsiCo subsidiary Frito-Lay.

PepsiCo is analyzing what routes are best for its Tesla trucks in North America but sees a wide range of uses for lighter loads like snacks or shorter shipments of heavier beverages, O'Connell said.

Tesla did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Tesla unveiled the Semi last month and expects the truck to be in production by 2019.

O'Connell declined to say how much PepsiCo paid to reserve its trucks, when it placed its pre-orders, or whether it plans to lease the trucks or buy them outright. Tesla initially asked $5,000 per truck for pre-orders but that amount has since risen to about $20,000.

By James Davey

LONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - British grocery inflation hit its
highest level since 2013 over the last quarter, led by price
rises in products such as butter, fish and fresh pork, industry
data showed on Tuesday.

Grocery inflation was 3.6 percent in the 12 weeks to Dec. 3,
up from 3.4 percent in its November report, market researcher
Kantar Worldpanel said. [nL8N1NK3BC]

Prices were falling in only a few categories, such as fresh
poultry and crisps, it said.

"We expect inflation will peak in this period or the next
and will drop next year once the (lagged) FX impact starts to
fall away," Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne said.

Official data on Tuesday showed overall British inflation
rose to its highest level in nearly six years in November,
tightening the post-Brexit vote squeeze on households whose
spending is the main driver of the country's economy.
[nUKLCNED0P]

Kantar said overall supermarket sales increased in value by
3.1 percent year on year over the 12 weeks to Dec. 3 - below the
rate of inflation.

It said Tesco  was the best performer with a sales
rise of 2.5 percent. Sainsbury's , Morrisons  and
Asda  had growth of 2.0 percent, 1.4 percent and 1.2
percent respectively.

Shares in Tesco were up 0.5 percent at 0938 GMT, Sainsbury's
was down 2.7 percent and Morrisons was down 2.9 percent.

All of the big four grocers continued to lose market share
to German discounters, who are continuing to expand
aggressively.

Aldi's [ALDIEI.UL] sales increased 15.1 percent, as it
reclaimed the crown as Britain's fastest growing grocer. Lidl's
sales increased 14.5 percent.

Kantar noted that online grocery sales growth slowed
considerably to 2.8 percent, though specialist Ocado
outperformed the market with growth of 5.2 percent.

Kantar forecast that over Friday Dec. 22 and Saturday Dec.
23 UK shoppers would spend 1.5 billion pounds ($2.0 billion).

Last week research group IGD forecast the UK grocery market
would grow 2.6 percent to 22.2 billion pounds over the entire
festive period.

{{20171208T205203.621+0000}}UPDATE 1-Retailers' Dec. imports to rise on last-minute restocking -NRF(Adds comment from AlixPartners' director)

Dec 8 (Reuters) - Imports by retailers are estimated to rise 1.5 percent in December, indicating that companies are expecting strong sales through the holiday season, according to industry group National Retail Federation (NRF).

Major U.S. retail container ports are expected to handle 1.6 million TEUs in December, according to the NRF's monthly Global Port Tracker report. A TEU is a 20-foot-long cargo container or its equivalent.

"Retailers are doing last-minute restocking as consumers head toward the finish line of the shopping season," Jonathan Gold, NRF's vice president for supply chain and customs policy, said.

More than 174 million U.S. shoppers made purchases over the Thanksgiving weekend and Cyber Monday, the NRF said last week, beating the industry group's expectations and signaling a strong start to the holiday quarter. [nL3N1NY4XJ]

"With tax cuts that will leave more money in shoppers' pockets in the headlines and consumer confidence high, all signs are that this has been a strong holiday season," Gold said.

Most retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Macy's Inc , headed into the holiday season with leaner inventories than previous years as they try to reduce the risk of ending the holidays with huge amounts of leftover inventory.

The core reason for the expected rise in imports is more an indicator of optimism for 2018 as companies try to better position their inventories in an improving economy, said Bill Lewis, director at consulting firm AlixPartners.

Ports covered by the Global Port Tracker handled 5.9 percent more TEUs in October from last year, while for November those were estimated to be down 0.3 percent.

"The fact that imports are still at a relatively high level and increasing over last year reflects that sales are doing well – retailers don't import merchandise unless they think they can sell it," Craig Shearman, NRF's vice president for government affairs public relations, said.

UPDATE 4-Budweiser maker Anheuser-Busch reserves 40 Tesla electric trucks - 路透新闻

{{20171207T204504.170+0000}}UPDATE 4-Budweiser maker Anheuser-Busch reserves 40 Tesla electric trucks(Adds new tally of Tesla orders, paragraph 5; adds details on order, paragraph 9)

Dec 7 (Reuters) - Budweiser beer maker Anheuser-Busch has reserved 40 Tesla Inc all-electric Semi trucks as it seeks to reduce fuel costs and vehicle emissions, the brewer said on Thursday.

It was one of the largest publicly announced orders Tesla has received for its electric trucks, which are scheduled to be in production by 2019.

"At Anheuser-Busch, we are constantly seeking new ways to make our supply chain more sustainable, efficient, and innovative," said James Sembrot, senior director of logistics strategy. "This investment in Tesla semi-trucks helps us achieve these goals while improving road safety and lowering our environmental impact."

The U.S. subsidiary of Anheuser-Busch InBev NV plans to use the trucks for shipments to wholesalers within the 500-mile (800-km) range promised by Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk.

The Semi is Tesla's next step to move the economy away from fossil fuels. Limited early orders have reflected uncertainty about the market for electric commercial vehicles due to their limited range compared with diesel vehicles.

A range of trucking, grocery, and retail companies have reserved at least 117 Tesla Semi trucks, according to a Reuters tally, including Anheuser-Busch's 40. That number could be higher because fleet operator J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc said it reserved multiple Semis without providing a specific number.

Surging online orders slow Wal-Mart delivery network - 路透新闻

{{20171206T222651.594+0000}}Surging online orders slow Wal-Mart delivery networkBy Eric M. Johnson and Nandita Bose

SEATTLE/CHICAGO, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Wednesday that soaring online purchases have caused delays in its distribution network, reflecting the challenge retailers and delivery services face in handling strong peak-season ecommerce demand.

"The week of Thanksgiving is an incredibly busy time for all of retail," "With massive volume going through our system, there were some orders that took extra time, much like other major e-commerce sites," Wal-Mart spokeswoman Danit Marquardt said of the week of Thanksgiving.

"A vast majority of orders are shipping on time now," she added.

The backlog reflects the degree to which Wal-Mart, United Parcel Service and other companies struggled to handle peak ecommerce volumes despite months of preparation and major investments to expand and upgrade distribution facilities.

"This shows they've got more volume and they are not hitting some delivery windows, but it is not going to affect anyone's Christmas," said Satish Jindel, President of ShipMatrix, Inc, which analyzes shipping data.

Wal-Mart declined to comment on the number of customer orders impacted.

One senior FedEx employee said Wal-Mart's national distribution network had fallen behind in processing some four million customer orders, though he declined to elaborate on how this impacted FedEx deliveries.

A FedEx spokesman declined to comment.

"The FedEx networks are performing as designed," the spokesman, Glen Brandow, said.

UPS, which declined to comment on Wal-Mart's backlog, has also unveiled a number of surcharges in recent years, seen as a way to manage the higher costs associated with e-commerce. [nL2N1N10LS]

Adobe Analytics forecasts a record $107.4 billion holiday season for online orders, the first ever to cross the $100 billion mark, it said on Wednesday.

FedEx said it expected to deliver 380-400 million packages globally during the peak shipping season.

FedEx rival UPS has shifted more employees to certain markets to work through temporary delays caused by high volume and expected to clear the backlog this week, the world's largest package delivery company said on Tuesday. [L1N1O52BF]

UPS and FedEx have invested billions to upgrade and expand facilities in part to handle the boom in ecommerce business over the last decade, leaving investors chaffing over the expense.

Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, offers free two-day shipping on millions of items when the order size is over $35. The retailer said online sales surged 50 percent in the last quarter. [nL1N1NM0OQ]

Surging online orders slow Wal-Mart delivery network - 路透新闻

{{20171206T222649.000+0000}}Surging online orders slow Wal-Mart delivery networkSEATTLE/CHICAGO, Dec 6 (Reuters)

By Eric M. Johnson and Nandita Bose

SEATTLE/CHICAGO, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Wednesday that soaring online purchases have caused delays in its distribution network, reflecting the challenge retailers and delivery services face in handling strong peak-season ecommerce demand.

"The week of Thanksgiving is an incredibly busy time for all of retail," "With massive volume going through our system, there were some orders that took extra time, much like other major e-commerce sites," Wal-Mart spokeswoman Danit Marquardt said of the week of Thanksgiving.

"A vast majority of orders are shipping on time now," she added.

The backlog reflects the degree to which Wal-Mart, United Parcel Service and other companies struggled to handle peak ecommerce volumes despite months of preparation and major investments to expand and upgrade distribution facilities.

"This shows they've got more volume and they are not hitting some delivery windows, but it is not going to affect anyone's Christmas," said Satish Jindel, President of ShipMatrix, Inc, which analyzes shipping data.

Wal-Mart declined to comment on the number of customer orders impacted.

One senior FedEx employee said Wal-Mart's national distribution network had fallen behind in processing some four million customer orders, though he declined to elaborate on how this impacted FedEx deliveries.

A FedEx spokesman declined to comment.

"The FedEx networks are performing as designed," the spokesman, Glen Brandow, said.

UPS, which declined to comment on Wal-Mart's backlog, has also unveiled a number of surcharges in recent years, seen as a way to manage the higher costs associated with e-commerce. [nL2N1N10LS]

Adobe Analytics forecasts a record $107.4 billion holiday season for online orders, the first ever to cross the $100 billion mark, it said on Wednesday.

FedEx said it expected to deliver 380-400 million packages globally during the peak shipping season.

FedEx rival UPS has shifted more employees to certain markets to work through temporary delays caused by high volume and expected to clear the backlog this week, the world's largest package delivery company said on Tuesday. [L1N1O52BF]

UPS and FedEx have invested billions to upgrade and expand facilities in part to handle the boom in ecommerce business over the last decade, leaving investors chaffing over the expense.

Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, offers free two-day shipping on millions of items when the order size is over $35. The retailer said online sales surged 50 percent in the last quarter. [nL1N1NM0OQ]

Wal-Mart to integrate physical, online units in Brazil - 路透新闻

{{20171205T165901.382+0000}}Wal-Mart to integrate physical, online units in BrazilDec 5 (Reuters) - The Brazilian unit of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has decided to integrate its physical retail and e-commerce activities, as well as expand its so-called online marketplace operations, the company said in a statement on Tuesday.

Together with an ongoing campaign to revamp its stores and introduce more regional and in-house brands, the new initiatives should cost about 1.5 billion reais ($464 million) over the next four years, Walmart Brasil said.

Online marketplaces are an increasingly popular e-commerce format, in which websites offers products from third-party retailers, rather than just the company hosting the site.

UPDATE 2-Carrefour and Fnac Darty form French purchasing partnership - 路透新闻

{{20171205T093106.718+0000}}UPDATE 2-Carrefour and Fnac Darty form French purchasing partnership* Deal follows recent retail sector alliances amid Amazon threat

* Carrefour/Fnac purchasing deal to apply to France

* Carrefour working on new strategy, aiming to cut costs

* Fnac shares rise, touch record high

(Adds share price moves, fund manager, analyst comments)

By Sudip Kar-Gupta

PARIS, Dec 5 (Reuters) - French retailers Carrefour and Fnac Darty will team up for purchases of domestic appliances and consumer electronics in France as Carrefour seeks to cut costs and boost earnings, the companies said on Tuesday.

The purchasing agreement will take effect for supplier negotiations in 2018 but Carrefour and Fnac Darty stressed they would maintain independent commercial policies.

Supermarket operator Carrefour, the world's largest retailer after Wal-Mart , hired Chief Executive Alexandre Bompard in July from Fnac Darty, France's largest electronics retailer. [nL8N1J3108]

The tie-up follows a similar partnership sealed last year between domestic rival Casino and furniture chain Conforama.

French retailers are intensely aware of the threat posed by Amazon , whose acquisition of U.S. food retail chain Whole Foods has triggered speculation the online giant is looking to crack the European market next.

Casino last week agreed to use British online retailer Ocado's platform to expand its e-commerce grocery business in a deal that analysts say will allow Casino to outpace domestic rivals. [nL8N1NY15L]

CARREFOUR'S COST CUTS

Fnac Darty shares initially rose to a record high of 94.51 euros, before settling back to trade up 0.6 percent at 91.50 euros by 0925 GMT. Shares in Carrefour, which issued a profit warning in August, were flat.

"This partnership will allow both companies to achieve cost savings, while the tie-up is also complementary as Fnac shops are mainly in town centres while Carrefour outlets tend to be in the suburbs," said Roche Brune Asset Management fund manager Gregoire Laverne, whose firm owns shares in both companies.

Bompard is expected to back a far-reaching restructuring that some analysts estimate could involve a billion euros ($1.2 billion) of cost cutting. Carrefour is due to unveil its strategic plan on Jan. 23.

Investors want Bompard to boost the performance of the group's France-based hypermarkets, a goal that has eluded several predecessors amid competition online and price discounting from rivals such as unlisted Leclerc.

They also want him to catch up as more shoppers go online for their goods. [nL8N1NZ2AU]

Bernstein analysts estimated the deal with Fnac Darty would generate 90 million euros of savings for Carrefour or 25 basis points of French margin, which would give it "additional firepower to be invested in the French business".

On Monday Fnac Darty said it was banking on merger synergies and its ability to deliver sales growth above that of its markets in order to nearly double its operating margin mid-term. [nL8N1O458K]

Fnac shares are up around 40 percent since the start of 2017, while Carrefour shares are down around 20 percent. ($1 = 0.8429 euros)

Varejo ainda não saiu completamente da crise que dura 15 semestres, diz presidente do Walmart Brasil  - 路透新闻

{{20171204T142918.322+0000}}Varejo ainda não saiu completamente da crise que dura 15 semestres, diz presidente do Walmart Brasil SÃO PAULO, 4 Dez (Reuters) - O varejo no Brasil enfrenta uma crise há quase 15 semestres e ainda não saiu completamente dela, disse nesta segunda-feira o presidente do Walmart Brasil, Flávio Cotini.

Ele ponderou que a empresa está confiante em relação às perspectivas de retomada da economia, embora persista um sentimento de cautela. "Estamos confiantes e alertas….O desafio é grande", afirmou o executivo durante Seminário Brasil 2018, organizado pela Câmara Americana de Comércio (Amcham), em São Paulo.

Além da retração da atividade econômica e do desemprego, ele destacou que a deflação nas commodities como resultado da safra recorde de cerca de 200 milhões de toneladas de grãos no Brasil adicionou pressão sobre o varejo.

No caso do Walmart Brasil, Cotini disse que o grupo se empenhou em uma revisão de portfólio e lojas para atravessar a crise no país. "É a primeira em que o consumidor deixou de consumir antes da queda na renda", lembrou.

UPDATE 3-Kroger profit improves amid Amazon threat, shares pop  - Reuters News

{{20171130T181451.432+0000}}UPDATE 3-Kroger profit improves amid Amazon threat, shares pop (Adds analyst comment, details on results)

By Lisa Baertlein and Vibhuti Sharma

Nov 30 (Reuters) - Kroger Co issued an upbeat holiday forecast and better-than-expected quarterly results, helped by aggressive discounts that lured more shoppers to its supermarkets, and shares soared as much as 13.6 percent.

The results suggest that Kroger is successfully responding to a new wave of competition from traditional rivals like Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Aldi, as well as new entrants such as Amazon.com/Whole Foods and German discounter Lidl.

"Based on the wall of worry over Amazon, Walmart and Aldi, fundamental concerns over Kroger's competitive position proved to be overblown," said Pivotal Research Group analyst Ajay Jain. He added that Kroger's year-over-year earnings in the period improved for the first time in four quarters.

Kroger managed to boost gross margins more than anticipated. It posted more sales of higher-profit, private-label products as it also lowered its overall cost of goods, which took some pain out of its significant price cuts.

After booking its best-ever "Black Friday" results for general merchandise, Kroger now expects fourth-quarter sales at identical stores open at least a year to exceed 1.1 percent.

But the company, which operates some 2,800 U.S. supermarkets under banners including Ralphs, Harris Teeter and Food 4 Less, is not out of the woods yet. It is locked in a brutal grocery price war and a multi-front fight for a "share of the stomach."

The company launched "Restock Kroger" in October to strengthen its position. Among other things, it has begun levying fines for late supply deliveries, which improves product selection and curbs waste.

Kroger is also expanding online services that include home delivery and "ClickList" curbside pickup.

It expects "Restock Kroger" to generate $400 million in incremental operating profit margin over the three years from 2018 to 2020.

Shares in Cincinnati-based Kroger were up 8.1 percent at $26.37 in early afternoon trading after hitting a session high of $27.70.

But even with Thursday's gain, the stock remains down more 20 percent this year. It trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 14.8 percent, compared with 29.2 for Wal-Mart, its chief rival.

Profit rose 1.5 percent to $397 million, or 44 cents per share, for the third quarter ended Nov. 4, and total revenue rose 4.5 percent to $27.75 billion. That topped analysts' targets of 40 cents per share on sales of $27.46 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Kroger also reaffirmed its 2017 adjusted earnings per share forecast of $2.00 to $2.05, just above analysts' average target of $1.97 per share.
