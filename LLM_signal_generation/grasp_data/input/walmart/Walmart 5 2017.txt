{{20170531T083237.766+0000}}UPDATE 1-UK discount food retailers' growth accelerates as prices rise(Adds detail, table)

LONDON, May 31 (Reuters) - British sales at discount food
retailers Aldi [ALDIEI.UL] and Lidl [LIDUK.UL] rose at their
fastest rate since January 2015 and gained market share, while
prices continued to rise, industry data showed on Wednesday.

Market researcher Kantar Worldpanel said Aldi's sales rose
19.8 percent in the 12 weeks to May 21 year-on-year, while
Lidl's increased 18.3 percent, giving a joint record combined
market share of 12 percent.

Grocery price inflation was recorded at 2.9 percent
year-on-year, up from 2.6 percent in the previous period.

It said some higher prices such as for butter, fish and cola
were partially offset by falling prices in other categories
including cooking sauces and cooked poultry.

Kantar Worldpanel said 62 percent of the UK population
shopped in an Aldi or Lidl during the 12-week period compared
with 58 percent this time last year – an additional 1.1 million
households.

"Consumers are starting to feel the pinch as prices continue
to rise, with the average household spending an additional 27
pounds ($34.59) on groceries during the past 12 weeks," said
Chris Hayward, consumer specialist at Kantar Worldpanel.

Overall sales in the market increased by 3.8 percent, the
biggest rise since September 2013.

All 10 grocers saw a sales rise, boosted by the inflation.

Market leader Tesco's  sales growth was 1.8 percent,
Sainsbury's  was 1.7 percent, Asda's  was 0.9
percent and Morrisons'  was 1.9 percent.

However, all the big four saw their market shares edge
lower.

Separately on Wednesday two surveys showed British consumer
confidence edged up to a four-month high in May but households
remained downbeat about the economic outlook, with inflation
since last year's Brexit vote feeding into higher prices in
stores. [nL9N1FL01W]

COLUMN-In age of 'superstar firms,' index investing logic holds: James Saft - 路透新闻

{{20170529T171403.963+0000}}COLUMN-In age of 'superstar firms,' index investing logic holds: James Saft(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters)

By James Saft

May 29 (Reuters) - Even in the age of "superstar firms," the logic of index investing holds.

New research details how a small number of companies - think Google, Amazon and Apple - have come to dominate their sectors, capturing a growing share of revenues and helping to create an economy featuring high corporate profits but a lower share of the pie for workers.

Economists David Autor, David Dorn, Lawrence Katz, Christina Patterson and John Van Reenen find that industries have become more concentrated and while what they call "superstar firms" pay well, they make extraordinary profits. The net impact across the economy, perhaps as other firms struggle to compete, is that workers' share of GDP falls. (https://economics.mit.edu/files/12979)

Commentators have concentrated on the economic, social and policy implications of superstar firms but the investment ones are also interesting, and not obvious.

While you might think that the trick to investing in an economy with a few winners and many also-rans is to identify the Amazons and buy them, this, of course, is much more easily done looking backward than looking forward.

One problem is that the research finds that the concentration rises in industries with faster technological change. While fast technological change seems to bring big winners and concentration - see Facebook, it also brings with it the risk that companies will be supplanted by other technology in the future.

Indeed, one of the named superstar firms is Wal-Mart, which as a mostly physical retailer is now seeing its own position hollowed out by the likes of Amazon. Or consider IBM, which surely would once have been thought of as a superstar but which now is notable more for its fondness for share buybacks than its strong returns as a stock.

The reality is that a winner-take-all-society is a risky society, and that applies as much to investors as it does to college graduates or mid-career workers. It simply is not as simple as just figuring out who is 'winning' and climbing on board. A concentrated bet on superstar firms is very likely highly risky, not just in theory, as are all concentrated bets, but also in practice due to the rate of technological change.

CAPTURING GROWING MARGINS VIA THE INDEX

Index investing, in contrast, will allow investors to be exposed to the rising, or persistently high, corporate margins which are a feature of a more highly concentrated economy. In other words, and sadly, the wise bet may not be on Amazon or Facebook, per se, but against labor.

While rising concentration and falling wages are new, it has long been a fact that the vast majority of the money made on the stock market comes via a tiny number of firms which skyrocket in value.

Hendrik Bessembinder of Arizona State University calculated in a recent study that just 86 stocks have, over 90 years, accounted for $16 trillion in wealth creation, or about half the total of wealth created by the entire universe of companies over that period.

The other 26,000 or so stocks created the other $16 trillion of wealth, but even that is a misleading guide to how well an individual stock might do. The top 1,000 stocks, or less than 4 percent of all companies traded over 86 years, account for all wealth creation.

"The results also help to explain why active strategies, which tend to be poorly diversified, most often underperform," Bessembinder wrote in a draft study updated in May. (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2900447)

It is notable too that superstar firms have risen, and wages fallen, during a period with rising globalization and a political and regulatory backdrop which allowed it to happen. It may well be that Google, Amazon and Facebook face new political and regulatory roadblocks to maintaining their position. This certainly is already true in China.

So your choices boil down to these:

1 - Try to identify some of the 86 superstars in advance. Good luck with that.

2 - Buy stocks you think are among the 86 after they so prove and hope they hold their position. This strategy misses out on all of the gains these few superstar firms make before it dawns on you they've arrived. It also exposes you to huge risks that they are in turn supplanted.

3 - Buy a broad stock market index, including earlier-stage companies, and slowly build wealth by collecting the equity risk premium and allowing it to compound.

The logic of choice 3 should hold as the balance between profits and labor evolves.

UPDATE 5-Sears surges as cost cuts, asset sale help post profit - Reuters News

{{20170525T190807.047+0000}}UPDATE 5-Sears surges as cost cuts, asset sale help post profit* Reports first profit in 7 quarters

* Q1 costs plunge 30.6 pct to $4 bln

* Shares jump as much as 32.5 pct

(Adds comments)

By Sruthi Ramakrishnan

May 25 (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp reported its first quarterly profit in nearly two years, as the retailer slashed costs by nearly a third and benefited from the sale of its Craftsman brand, sending its shares surging as much as 32.5 percent.

The company's shares, which are heavily shorted, posted their biggest intraday percentage gain in more than three months. The shares had fallen 18 percent since Sears raised going concern doubts in March. [nL3N1GY5F8]

Quarterly sales, however, continued their years-long decline, while the company's cash balance fell to $264 million as of April 29 from $286 million at Jan. 28. [nPn3Z667ha]

Sears, once the largest U.S. retailer, has been struggling to turn around its business for years amid intensifying competition from Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Amazon.com Inc .

The worsening retail environment hasn't helped either, forcing Sears and others including Macy's Inc to close stores and cut costs.

Sears, which sold its Craftsman tools brand to Stanley Black & Decker in March, said it had cut up to $700 million in costs to date since February as part of a program to reduce costs by $1.25 billion.

Total costs in the first quarter fell to $4 billion.

SHORT SQUEEZE

Sears CEO Eddie Lampert said on Thursday the results had "clearly demonstrated" the company's commitment to return to solid financial footing.

However, at least two people, including a hedge fund manager, said the stock's surge was more indicative of a short squeeze than a turnaround in the business.

"The stock movement does not indicate anything related to investment on the basis of fundamentals," David Tawil, president of hedge fund Maglan Capital, which invests in distressed companies, told Reuters. The fund said it does not have a stake in Sears.

Mark Cohen, former CEO of Sears Canada, backed the view.

"There's no turnaround. Anybody who suggests that that's the case... is suffering from a loss of reality," said Cohen, currently director of retail studies at Columbia Business School.

As of May 15, short interest stood at 13.5 percent of the company's outstanding shares, according to Reuters data. Sears, which has not posted an annual profit in six years, has also struggled with a big debt pile.

Total liabilities at the end of the quarter was $12.6 billion, down from $13.19 billion at the end of the fourth quarter.

Sales at Sears' U.S. stores open more than a year fell 12.4 percent, while at Kmart they declined 11.2 percent. Total revenue fell by a fifth to $4.30 billion.

Net income attributable to Sears' shareholders was $244 million, or $2.28 per share, within the range of the company's forecast in April. [nPn7hGZ83a]

Excluding restructuring items, the company reported a net loss of $2.15 per share.

The company's shares were up 11 percent at $8.31 in late-afternoon trading.

Wal-Mart's South African arm Massmart reports drop in like-for-like sales - 路透新闻

{{20170525T110009.644+0000}}Wal-Mart's South African arm Massmart reports drop in like-for-like salesJOHANNESBURG, May 25 (Reuters) - South African-based retailer Massmart , majority-owned by Wal-Mart Inc , reported on Thursday a near 2 percent fall in overall same-store sales in the first five months of the current year, as outlets outside its home market underperformed.

Bought into by Wal-Mart seven years ago in a $2.4 billion deal that gave the world's biggest retailer a foothold in several potentially high-growth markets in sub-Saharan Africa, Massmart has struggled with weakening economies and has therefore become more cautious in its expansion policy across the region.

The company, which sells everything from food to electronic devices and building materials, said comparable store sales for the first 21 weeks of the 2017 fiscal year fell 1.9 percent, with sales in South Africa down 0.4 percent and outside South Africa down by nearly 16 percent.

Sales in South Africa account for 91 percent of total turnover.

Shares in the Johannesburg-based company fell 3.5 percent to 114.86 rand, lagging behind a slightly lower JSE Top-40 index <.JTOPI>.

Once at the heart of executives' expansion plans, sub-Saharan Africa growth prospects were dealt a blow in mid 2014 with a fall in the prices of oil and other commodities - export mainstays for many local economies - partly due to a slowdown in demand from leading consumer China.

Massmart's chief executive Guy Hayward told a shareholder meeting that the company's performance was also affected by consumers becoming more cautious about spending and after South Africa lost two highly prized investment grade credit ratings last month.

"The unfavourable impact on sales in discretionary product categories, such as general merchandise, has been notable and appears to be as strongly linked to weak consumer confidence as it is to underlying economic issues," Hayward said.

UPDATE 3-CEOs of Target, ADM offer differing views on U.S. border tax at hearing - 路透新闻

{{20170523T173016.098+0000}}UPDATE 3-CEOs of Target, ADM offer differing views on U.S. border tax at hearing(Adds hearing conclusion)

By Ginger Gibson

WASHINGTON, May 23 (Reuters) - The chief executive officers of two major American companies - retailer Target Corp and agribusiness Archer Daniels Midland Co - offered opposing views in a hearing before U.S. lawmakers on Tuesday on a proposed border adjustment tax.

Target CEO Brian Cornell has been one of the most vocal opponents of the Republican-backed border adjustment tax and testified alongside Juan Luciano, president and CEO of ADM, who spoke in favor of the proposal.

The border tax would imposes a tax on imports while providing a credit for exports and has been proposed by House Republicans as part of a larger tax code overhaul. Target is a big importer of goods, while ADM exports.

House Speaker Paul Ryan argues the proposed border tax, which is estimated to garner $1 trillion, will not affect prices and will allow rate cuts for businesses while not creating deficits, but retailers warn that it could raise consumer prices as much as 15 percent.

Cornell and Luciano took staunchly different positions on the tax.

"Under the new border adjustment tax, American families – your constituents – would pay more so many multinational corporations can pay even less," Cornell told the committee.

Luciano, on the other hand, argued that the tax would make American companies more competitive.

"A competitive tax code will help us continue providing American-made food and feed to our customers in the United States and abroad in the face of robust and, from a tax perspective, ever strengthening competition from abroad," he said.

The outlook for passage of the border tax - which drew staunch opposition from retailers - remains perilous, especially as key Senate Republicans and President Donald Trump have refused to endorse it. [nL1N1IB23T] [nL2N1GBJ8W]

Several Republican members of the committee expressed concerns about the tax during the hearing that stretched more than three hours, including Republican Representative Jim Renacci who argued the proposal could hurt small businesses that rely on imports.

Dimming the prospects more, lawmakers and lobbyists have begun to speculate that Congress will be unable to rally support for a sweeping tax code overhaul this year, and are beginning to look instead at cutting tax rates without broad reform.

The committee heard from two additional supporters of the tax, including William Simon, the former CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc , who despite his past with a large retailer that opposes the tax, endorsed the measure.

"We will see more good middle class jobs, a robust U.S. economy and an era of growth that will be led by a new industrial revolution," Simon said.

Lawrence Lindsey, the former director of the National Economic Council under President George W. Bush, also supported the tax.

Economist Kimberly Clausing, of Reed College, criticized the proposal, saying she disagrees with the argument by proponents that currency markets would prevent consumer prices from increasing.

"This is an untested tax reform that is not ready for primetime," she said.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Wal-Mart's online therapy may revive ailing retail - 路透新闻

{{20170522T192020.832+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Wal-Mart's online therapy may revive ailing retail(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Jennifer Saba

NEW YORK, May 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Wal-Mart's online therapy may help revive ailing retailers. The $242 billion giant is starting to reap the benefits of embracing e-commerce while shares in digital laggards like Macy's and J.C. Penney plummeted after poor results. Unless they follow the behemoth's lead, they're likely to hand more market share to Wal-Mart and internet megastore Amazon .

After years of fits and starts, Wal-Mart's revenue from online sales jumped by an impressive 63 percent in the first three months of the year, compared to the same period in 2016. What's more, executives attributed the rise largely to existing operations rather than to acquisitions like last year's $3.3 billion Jet.com deal.

Chief Executive Doug McMillon has achieved this by playing to people's desire to save money. Customers get discounts if they buy online and pick up in a store, for example. And two-day shipping for purchases of $35 or more is free. That even forced Amazon, which rarely imitates the competition, to lower its threshold for free shipping.

It's a relative bright spot in a troubled industry. Some are filing for bankruptcy, as teen fashion store Rue 21 did last week. Others missed estimates on poor sales, sending their shares into another nosedive after years of flat or falling revenue. Foot Locker , Dick's Sporting Goods , Macy's and J.C. Penney have lost between 16 percent and 24 percent in value over the past month on the back of bad earnings.

Like Wal-Mart, some have made a lot of noise about buying online stores, but keep mum about how much business they're getting. Macy's would only say that it's increasing by double digits. Chief Financial Officer Karen Hoguet argues that it's "almost impossible" to break out digital sales because of all the "cross-channel activity."

Online, though, is where the growth is. Amazon's U.S. sales jumped by 24 percent last quarter. Overall, industry e-commerce revenue may grow 70 percent by 2021 to $790 billion, research outfit eMarketer reckons. That'd only take its share to 14 percent of total revenue, from 9 percent this year. But with it comes greater flexibility on costs and inventory. That'll be even more important if the recent trend continues of people spending less money on clothes in favor of travel and the like, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Failing to get online right may mean getting everything wrong.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Review: Democrats' chief firebrand fumbles message - 路透新闻

{{20170519T135140.683+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Review: Democrats' chief firebrand fumbles message(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Gina Chon

WASHINGTON, May 19 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elizabeth Warren's latest book reads like a marker for a 2020 White House campaign. In "This Fight is Our Fight," the U.S. senator from Massachusetts blasts familiar targets like lobbyists and Wall Street, plus a new foe: President Donald Trump. Tales of struggling Americans are engagingly woven into the outrage. Still, her rote views limit her appeal.

In just four years in the Senate, Warren's national profile has risen quickly. Her impassioned speeches criticizing bankers made her a darling among liberals. That vitriol is on stark display in the book. She also lists the mistakes the Democratic Party made in 2016. However, her solutions are more like empty campaign slogans: demand democracy, build opportunity and fight.

Towards the end of the book, Warren reveals she contemplated running for the presidency in 2016 and discussed it with her husband - a Harvard professor, as she used to be. He warned that a presidential campaign would be "a lot worse" than her 2012 Senate race, when she was ridiculed for claiming Native American heritage. "Talking with Bruce and asking the question out loud had settled it," Warren writes. "I wanted to stay buckled down and keep doing my job."

Trump's improbable victory and chaotic first months have added urgency to the search for a candidate capable of challenging him in 2020. The TV tycoon mused in April that Warren might be his next rival. She has what Hillary Clinton lacked: the ability to rally the Democratic base. As she writes, "I now start every day by reminding myself that Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by nearly three million votes."

But Warren's strengths may prove a drawback when it comes to appealing to voters across America. It's doubtful that she would have Clinton's ability to win over moderate Republicans. She would also risk turning off so-called "Goldman Sachs Democrats" – traditional party supporters skeptical of her anti-finance and pro-regulation stance. In a February poll conducted by Morning Consult for Politico, voters favored a generic Democratic candidate over Trump by 8 percentage points, but Warren trailed the president by 6 points.

The main lesson Warren appears to have learned from the 2016 campaign is to double down on her anger. She doesn't present any new or unexpected ideas. Indeed, the most surprising disclosure comes on the book's first page, where Warren reveals that she and her husband spent election night watching "Ballers," an HBO comedy starring Dwayne Johnson, the actor and former wrestler known as The Rock.

The rest of "This Fight is Our Fight" is classic Warren, attacking corporations and the rich who fight for tax loopholes and less regulation at the expense of average Americans. She illustrates those struggles with tales of everyday hardship.

There is Gina, a North Carolina resident who got a business degree and worked as a sales representative while her husband was a roofer. Later on, Gina is working at Wal-Mart while her husband's assignments are spotty. Their income is cut in half. "What happened?...Nothing. No crisis. No accident. No tale of woe," Warren writes. "Just the grinding wear and tear of an economy that doesn't work any more for families like Gina's."

Warren rightly points out that growing GDP and rising stocks don't necessarily mean prosperity for ordinary citizens. But to blame Gina's woes on a bubbly equity market seems disingenuous. It's the kind of zero-sum rationale that Trump has embraced. If China and other countries are doing better, it must be at the expense of the United States.

Warren criticizes wealthy Republican donors like the Koch brothers, but not Democrat-supporting hedge fund billionaires such as Tom Steyer and George Soros. She also reiterates her ill-advised scorn for former Lazard banker Antonio Weiss, who withdrew from a Senate-confirmed job in President Barack Obama's administration after Warren opposed him. Though the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington has its drawbacks, financial experience is helpful in some government positions.

Democrats have a chance to recapture the White House in 2020. The popular backlash to the planned repeal of Obama's healthcare reforms could cost Trump votes in many states that backed him last November. Probes into his campaign's links with Russia could delay a promised tax overhaul and infrastructure spending. The president's erratic and questionable actions, like his decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, seem certain to further undermine his approval ratings.

During the 2016 campaign, Warren proved she could get under Trump's skin with tweet storms that matched the president's own. Her fans love her persistence and tough talk. But to take the White House as a Democrat she will have to win over a broader base of supporters. The broken-record rhetoric in this book will do little to entice them.

FOKUS 5-Wall Street erholt sich leicht - Kursgünstige Anschaffungen - 路透新闻

{{20170518T171040.572+0000}}FOKUS 5-Wall Street erholt sich leicht - Kursgünstige Anschaffungen* Hinweise auf enge Kontakte zwischen Trump-Team und Russland

* Wal-Mart mit Umsatzplus - Aktie nach Zahlen gefragt

(neu: Schwerpunkt New York, aktualisierte Kurse)

New York, 18. Mai (Reuters) - Die US-Börsen haben sich am Donnerstag leicht erholt. Die Stimmung war Händlern zufolge nicht mehr so schlecht wie in den vergangenen Tagen. Anleger nutzten den Kurseinbruch vom Mittwoch[nL8N1IJ5U0] für den Wiedereinstieg. Der Dow-Jones-Index<.DJI> der Standardwerte legte bis zum frühen Nachmittag in New York um 0,2 Prozent auf 20.646 Punkte zu. Der breiter gefasste S&P-500<.SPX> rückte um 0,2 Prozent auf 2362 Zähler vor. Der Index der Technologiebörse Nasdaq<.IXIC> gewann 0,5 Prozent auf 6040 Punkte.

Das politische Wirrwarr um US-Präsident Donald Trump nahm dagegen Anlegern in Europa die Lust auf Aktien. In Frankfurt ging der Dax<.GDAXI> den dritten Tag in Folge mit einem Minus aus dem Handel, er verlor 0,3 Prozent auf 12.590 Punkte und schloss auf dem tiefsten Stand seit Anfang Mai. Der EuroStoxx50<.STOXX50E> fiel um 0,6 Prozent auf 3562 Zähler. Die Verzögerung oder gar die Aufhebung von Steuersenkungsplänen und Infrastrukturprojekten wegen der Unsicherheiten im Weißen Haus treibe Anleger in die Defensive, sagte Analyst Gregor Kuhn vom Londoner Broker IG.

Wie Reuters von US-Regierungsinsidern erfuhr, hatten Berater von Trump in den letzten sieben Monaten des Wahlkampfes mindestens 18-mal per E-mail oder Telefon Kontakt zu russischen Regierungsvertretern oder Personen mit Kontakt zum Präsidialamt in Moskau. Die Erkenntnisse wurden Stunden nach der Ernennung eines Sonderermittlers bekannt, der den Vorwurf geheimer Absprachen zwischen Trumps Team und der Regierung in Moskau sowie deren etwaigen Einfluss auf die US-Wahl untersuchen soll.

In den USA wird über ein Amtsenthebungsverfahren gegen den Präsidenten diskutiert. Da Trumps Republikaner Senat und Repräsentantenhaus kontrollierten, sei das aber alles andere als gesetzt, sagte Aktienhändler Markus Huber vom Brokerhaus City of London. Zudem dürften die Untersuchungen langwierig sein. Zwar sei die Unsicherheit für die Aktienmärkte nicht gut. Doch dürfte letztlich die Erholung der US-Wirtschaft entscheidend sein und die Märkte stützen. Anleger hatten seit der Wahl Trumps im November auf einen Wirtschaftsboom in den USA spekuliert, weltweit waren die Kurse deutlich gestiegen.

Bei den US-Einzelwerten waren Papiere des führenden Einzelhändlers Wal-Mart gefragt. Dieser steigerte seinen Umsatz im zurückliegenden Quartal etwas stärker als erwartet und rechnet für das laufende Quartal mit einer weiteren Beschleunigung. Der Kurs zog um 2,5 Prozent an.

Die Papiere des Netzwerkausrüsters Cisco Systems verbilligten sich dagegen um knapp acht Prozent, da er mit seiner Umsatzprognose die Anleger enttäuschte. Die Erlöse dürften im laufenden Quartal um vier bis sechs Prozent sinken, erwartet das Unternehmen. Zudem will Cisco weitere 1100 Stellen streichen, was zu einer Sonderbelastung vor Steuern von 150 Millionen Dollar führt.

UPDATE 4-Wal-Mart sales get boost from online growth, customer visits  - 路透新闻

{{20170518T161058.060+0000}}UPDATE 4-Wal-Mart sales get boost from online growth, customer visits (Adds details on online sales growth, food deflation and updates share price)

By Nandita Bose

CHICAGO, May 18 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc on Thursday reported higher-than-expected quarterly sales at established U.S. stores, as investments to bring more customers into the discount retailer paid off and a bigger push into e-commerce boosted online purchases, sending its shares flirting near a 52-week high.

Wal-Mart and analysts said the company is benefiting from a $2.7 billion investment to increase entry-level wages and enhance the training of its workforce, which has led to better stocked shelves and cleaner stores. It said store visits rose 1.5 percent, the tenth consecutive quarterly increase.

Earlier in the day, shares of Wal-Mart rose to $77.40 - a 52-week high. They were trading at $77 in mid-day.

Wal-Mart's efforts to close the gap with rival Amazon.com has started gaining momentum even as other retailers like department store chains struggle. Online sales for the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer rose 63 percent in the first quarter, which was higher than 29 percent growth in the fourth quarter and 20 percent in the third quarter.

Online sales added 0.8 percentage points to the first quarter comparable sales gain. Growth in the business has been picking up after Wal-Mart said in October it would slow down new store openings to focus on expanding its e-commerce business.

U.S. e-commerce chief Marc Lore told reporters in a call that online sales growth was boosted by offering free two-day shipping without membership fees, and higher repeat orders. "We need to scale our e-commerce business further and see some additional strength in our store comps to deliver the results we know we're capable of," said Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon.

The company said most of the internet sales growth was from existing online operations rather than from acquisitions. Wal-Mart, which acquired Jet.com in 2016, this year alone has snatched up online retail startups Shoebuy, Moosejaw and Modcloth, and is currently in talks with small online clothing retailer Bonobos.

"Wal-Mart's long string of investments in labor and e-commerce, including acquisitions, are enabling modest market share gains," John Zolidis, director equity research with the Buckingham Research Group said.

Wal-Mart's performance, along with rival Target's results on Wednesday, bucked a string of weak results from retailers Macy's Inc and J.C. Penney . [nL4N1IE4G4] Target reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings and sales. [nL4N1IJ3HF]

Wal-Mart said sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.4 percent, excluding fuel price fluctuations, and was the 11th consecutive quarterly increase. Analysts were expecting a 1.3 percent increase, according to Consensus Metrix.

Wal-Mart is aggressively investing in making prices more competitive compared to rivals. It has asked vendors to offer grocery prices that are 15 percent lower than competitors. [nL2N1GC03L][nL1N1ID07D]

Wal-Mart's U.S. Chief Executive Greg Foran said comparable sales in food and grocery improved during the quarter on lower food deflation, without sharing details. Grocery accounts for nearly 53 percent of overall revenue for the retailer.

"Wal-Mart's commitment to value pricing is driving traffic and growth in grocery and aggressive online strides are impacting comparable sales," Cowen & Co's senior research analyst Oliver Chen said in a note.

Earnings per share was $1 for the quarter ended on April 30, exceeding the analysts' average estimate of 96 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Consolidated net income fell to $3.04 billion from $3.08 billion due to a higher tax rate.

Quarterly revenue rose 1.4 percent to $117.5 billion, slightly lower than analysts expectations of $117.7 billion due to a stronger dollar, which reduces the value of overseas sales. Revenue grew 2.8 percent on a currency neutral basis.

For the second quarter, Wal-Mart expects an increase of 1.5 percent to 2 percent in U.S. same-store sales. It forecast earnings per share of $1 to $1.08, against market expectations of $1.07.

POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street hésitante face à la tempête autour de Trump - 路透新闻

{{20170518T141551.076+0000}}POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street hésitante face à la tempête autour de Trump18 mai (Reuters) - Wall Street évolue jeudi sur une note hésitante en début de séance face à la tempête politique provoquée par les soupçons de collusion entre la Russie et l'équipe de campagne de Donald Trump.

L'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> cède 29,26 points, soit 0,14%, à 20.577,67 quelques minutes après l'ouverture. Le Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX>, plus large, est quasiment inchangé et le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> prend 0,24%.

Donald Trump a qualifié jeudi la désignation d'un procureur spécial chargé d'enquêter sur les liens entre l'entourage du président et la Russie de "plus grande chasse aux sorcières" de l'histoire des Etats-Unis, quelques heures après avoir plaidé en faveur d'une enquête "minutieuse".

Après avoir atteint mercredi un plus bas depuis l'accession de Trump à la Maison blanche, le dollar <.DXY> se stabilise face à un panier de six devises de référence.

Aux valeurs, le géant chinois du commerce en ligne Alibaba cède 3,2% après avoir fait état d'un bénéfice moins élevé que prévu malgré un chiffre d'affaires supérieur aux attentes pour le quatrième trimestre.

Le groupe a annoncé également un programme de rachat d'actions sur deux ans d'un montant maximal six milliards de dollars (5,39 milliards d'euros).

LEAD 2-Wal-Mart attire les clients, dans ses magasins et en ligne - 路透新闻

{{20170518T133940.116+0000}}LEAD 2-Wal-Mart attire les clients, dans ses magasins et en ligne(Actualisé avec précisions sur les résultats, déclaration, cours de Bourse)

par Nandita Bose

CHICAGO, 18 mai (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores a annoncé jeudi une hausse légèrement plus marquée que prévu de ses ventes à magasins constants aux Etats-Unis au premier trimestre, à la faveur d'une meilleure fréquentation de ses magasins et de l'explosion de ses ventes en ligne.

Ces résultats sont salués par une hausse du titre en Bourse. L'action gagne 2,5% à 76,99 dollars dans les premiers échanges à Wall Street, plus forte hausse du Dow Jones <.DJI>, lui-même en recul de 0,2%. Elle a déjà pris 15,4% sur un an, soit une progression plus forte que celle de l'indice sectoriel S&P des biens de consommation courante <.SPLRCS> en hausse de 5% sur la même période.

Le numéro un mondial de la distribution semble récolter les fruits de son investissement de 2,7 milliards de dollars (2,43 milliards d'euros) dans l'augmentation de ses bas salaires et l'amélioration de la formation de ses employés, une politique qui a permis de mieux approvisionner les rayons et de disposer de magasins plus propres.

Wal-Mart a souligné que la fréquentation de ses magasins avaient augmenté de 1,5% au premier trimestre.

"Nous avons connu un début (de trimestre) plus lent que prévu, en partie en raison de retards dans la vérification de remboursements des taxes fédérales mais nous avons vu les ventes se raffermir tout au long du trimestre", a commenté le directeur financier, Brett Biggs, dans un communiqué.

Les ventes des magasins ouverts depuis au moins un an aux Etats-Unis ont, hors essence, augmenté de 1,4% sur les trois mois au 30 avril, premier trimestre de l'exercice 2017-2018 du premier distributeur mondial, contre une hausse anticipée de 1,3%, selon les analystes sondés par le cabinet d'études Consensus Metrix.

Les ventes sur internet ont bondi de 63% après une croissance de 29% au cours du trimestre précédent. Wal-Mart a souligné que cette hausse provenait davantage de ses opérations existantes que de ses acquisitions. Les ventes en ligne ont contribué à hauteur de 0,8 point de pourcentage à la croissance des ventes à périmètre comparable.

Pour développer ses ventes sur internet et rattraper son retard sur Amazon , Wal-Mart a entrepris d'acheter des start-up de la distribution en ligne. Il en a déjà acquis trois cette année et il est actuellement en négociation avec Bonobos, une petite enseigne d'habillement.

Le bénéfice par action est ressorti à 1 dollar sur la période, contre 0,98 dollar il y a un an et un consensus Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S de 0,96 dollar. Le bénéfice net consolidé a légèrement diminué, à 3,04 milliards de dollars contre 3,08 milliards, en raison d'une hausse du taux d'imposition.

Le chiffre d'affaires total a augmenté de 1,4% à 117,5 milliards de dollars, un niveau légèrement inférieur au consensus de 117,7 milliards en raison d'un raffermissement du dollar, qui réduit la valeur des ventes à l'étranger. Les ventes ont augmenté de 2,8% à taux de change constants.

Pour le deuxième trimestre, le chiffre d'affaires devrait augmenter de 1,5% à 2% dans les magasins ouverts depuis au moins un an aux Etats-Unis. Le groupe prévoit un bénéfice par action de 1,0 à 1,08 dollar, contre 1,07 dollar attendu sur le marché.

Wal-Mart atrae más compradores a sus locales en primer trimestre, ventas en internet suben con fuerza  - 路透新闻

{{20170518T132651.235+0000}}Wal-Mart atrae más compradores a sus locales en primer trimestre, ventas en internet suben con fuerza Por Nandita Bose

CHICAGO, 18 mayo (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc reportó el jueves utilidades por encima de lo esperado en sus ventas en tiendas establecidas en Estados Unidos, ya que más clientes visitaron la minorista y compraron a través de internet, un anuncio que impulsó sus acciones un 1,3 por ciento antes de la apertura de sesión.

Los sólidos resultados de Wal-Mart muestran que la minorista se está beneficiando de su inversión de 2.700 millones de dólares en incremento de salarios y capacitación de su fuerza laboral, que ha generado estanterías mejor abastecidas y tiendas más limpias. La empresa dijo que las visitas a sus locales aumentaron un 1,5 por ciento en el trimestre.

Las acciones de Wal-Mart subían a 76,19 dólares en los negocios previos al inicio de sesión en Wall Street. Al cierre del miércoles, el papel había ganado 8,7 por ciento en lo que va del año.

El desempeño de Wal-Mart, junto con los resultados de su rival Target Corp publicados el jueves, respalda la serie de débiles ganancias de las minoristas por departamento en Estados Unidos, como Macy's Inc .

Wal-Mart dijo que sus ventas en tiendas estadounidenses abiertas por al menos un año aumentaron 1,4 por ciento, excluyendo fluctuaciones por los precios del combustible, en el undécimo incremento consecutivo. Analistas esperaban un alza de 1,3 por ciento, de acuerdo a Consensus Metrix.

Las ventas online saltaron un 63 por ciento en el primer trimestre, por encima del aumento de 29 por ciento visto en el cuarto periodo del año pasado. La compañía dijo que buena parte del crecimiento se debió a sus operaciones en internet ya existentes, más que a partir de adquisiciones.

Las ganancias llegaron a 1 dólar por acción en el primer trimestre que finalizó el 30 de abril, excediendo el cálculo promedio de analistas de una utilidad de 96 centavos de dólar por papel, de acuerdo a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. El beneficio neto consolidado bajó a 3.040 millones de dólares, desde 3.080 millones de dólares, debido a un aumento en el pago de impuestos.

Los ingresos trimestrales de Wal-Mart alcanzaron 117.500 millones de dólares, levemente por debajo de las expectativas de analistas de 117.700 millones de dólares, debido a la fortaleza del dólar, que reduce el valor de las ventas en el exterior.

Vendas mesmas lojas do Wal-Mart nos EUA superam estimativas no 1º tri - 路透新闻

{{20170518T125622.692+0000}}Vendas mesmas lojas do Wal-Mart nos EUA superam estimativas no 1º triCHICAGO, 18 Mai (Reuters) - O Wal-Mart Stores divulgou nesta quinta-feira vendas trimestrais ligeiramente acima do esperado em lojas estabelecidas nos Estados Unidos à medida que o fluxo de clientes aumentou e as compras online aceleraram.

O lucro por ação chegou a 1 dólar no primeiro trimestre encerrado em 30 de abril, superando a média das previsões de analistas de 0,96 dólar, segundo a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. O lucro líquido consolidado caiu para 3,04 bilhões de dólares, ante 3,08 bilhões de dólares, devido a um aumento na taxa de imposto.

O Wal-Mart disse que as vendas em lojas norte-americanas abertas há pelo menos um ano aumentaram 1,4 por cento, excluindo as flutuações nos preços dos combustíveis. Analistas esperavam um aumento de 1,3 por cento, de acordo com a Consensus Metrix.

Para o segundo trimestre, o Wal-Mart disse que espera um aumento de 1,5 a 2 por cento nas vendas mesmas lojas dos EUA. A empresa ainda projetou lucro por ação de 1 a 1,08 dólar, contra as expectativas do mercado de 1,07 dólar.

No primeiro trimestre, as vendas online subiram 63 por cento, superando a alta de 29 por cento apurada no quarto trimestre. A empresa disse que a maior parte do crescimento foi de suas operações online existentes, e não de aquisições.

UPDATE 1-British supermarket chain Asda slows rate of sales decline - 路透新闻

{{20170518T122341.631+0000}}UPDATE 1-British supermarket chain Asda slows rate of sales decline(Adds detail, background)

LONDON, May 18 (Reuters) - Asda, the British supermarket arm of U.S. retail giant Wal-Mart , slowed the rate of sales decline in the first quarter, it said on Thursday, as its new management team started to make its mark on the business.

The UK's third-largest supermarket chain behind market leader Tesco and Sainsbury's said that sales at stores open more than a year fell by 2.8 percent, excluding fuel, in the three months to March 31, compared with a 2.9 percent decline in the previous quarter. [nL8N1G63PS]

"We're pleased that the momentum of Q4 has continued into the new year with a third consecutive quarter of improvement," said Chief Executive Sean Clarke.

"Despite this progress we are in no way complacent and there is still much for us to do."

Monthly industry data has also indicated an improved performance from Asda in April. [nL8N1I52VA]

Wal-Mart veteran Clarke, who joined Asda last July, and former Sainsbury's executive Roger Burnley, who started as chief operations officer three months later, have focused their turnaround efforts on the retail basics.

They have made Asda more competitive, sharpening pricing while improving the quality and availability of product ranges and stepping up efforts to offer better customer service.[nL5N1FS4I4]

"We're delivering more consistently for our customers, particularly in fresh food, service and availability -- both in stores and online," Clarke said.

Of Britain's big four supermarket players, which also includes Morrisons , Asda was hurt the most by the rise of German discounters Aldi [ALDIEI.UL] and Lidl [LIDUK.UL] and was also too slow in responding to that competition.

Separately on Thursday Wal-Mart reported higher than expected quarterly sales at established U.S. stores. [nL2N1IK0DA]

Wal-Mart mit Umsatzplus - Online-Geschäft wächst deutlich - 路透新闻

{{20170518T121039.126+0000}}Wal-Mart mit Umsatzplus - Online-Geschäft wächst deutlichChicago, 18. Mai (Reuters) - Der US-Einzelhändler Wal-Mart hat dank steigender Kundenbesuche und Online-Käufe etwas mehr umgesetzt als erwartet. Die Erlöse wuchsen in dem am 30. April beendeten Quartal um 1,4 Prozent, wie das Unternehmen am Donnerstag mitteilte. Analysten hatten mit 1,3 Prozent gerechnet. Zu dem Ergebnis trug ein um 63 Prozent im Vergleich zum Vorquartal gestiegener Online-Umsatz bei.

Der Überschuss lag wegen einer höheren Steuerbelastung mit 3,04 Milliarden Dollar einen Tick unter dem ein Jahr zuvor erreichten Ergebnis. Für das laufende zweite Quartal peilt Wal-Mart ein Umsatzplus zwischen 1,5 und 2,0 Prozent an. Die Bilanz und die Prognosen kamen vorbörslich gut an: Der Aktienkurs legte um 1,2 Prozent zu.

Wal-Mart-Ventes constantes supérieures aux attentes au T1 - 路透新闻

{{20170518T112737.344+0000}}Wal-Mart-Ventes constantes supérieures aux attentes au T1CHICAGO, 18 mai (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores a annoncé jeudi une hausse trimestrielle plus marquée que prévu de ses ventes à magasins constants aux Etats-Unis, à la faveur d'une hausse de la fréquentation de ses magasins et d'une augmentation de ses livraisons en ligne.

Les points de vente ouverts depuis au moins un an aux Etats-Unis ont, hors essence, augmenté de 1,4% sur les trois mois au 30 avril, premier trimestre de l'exercice 2017-2018, contre une hausse anticipée de 1,3%, selon les analystes sondés par le cabinet d'études Consensus Metrix.

Walmart Stores, vendite omogenee primo trimestre battono attese - 路透新闻

{{20170518T112132.950+0000}}Walmart Stores, vendite omogenee primo trimestre battono atteseCHICAGO, 18 maggio (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores chiude il primo trimestre con vendite a parità di perimetro più alte delle attese, aiutate da un aumento del traffico nei negozi Wal-Mart e Sam's Club e da una crescita dell'online.

Le vendite nei negozi Usa aperti da almeno un anno sono salite dell'1,4%, esclusi i carburanti. Gli analisti interpellati dalla società di ricerche Consesus Metrix avevano previsto un aumento dell'1,3%.

Nel trimestre, chiuso il 30 aprile, l'utile per azione della più grande catena del mondo è salito a 1 dollaro da 98 cent dello stesso periodo dell'anno prima.

L'utile netto consolidato è invece sceso a 3,04 miliardi di dollari da 3,08 miliardi a causa di un aumento del tax rate.

Il titolo nel pre borsa Usa cede lo 0,3% dopo i risultati.

UK's Asda says rate of sales decline eases slightly - 路透新闻

{{20170518T111555.851+0000}}UK's Asda says rate of sales decline eases slightlyLONDON, May 18 (Reuters) - Asda, the British supermarket arm of Wal-Mart , the world's largest retailer, said on Thursday its rate of sales decline eased slightly in its latest quarter as a new management team started to make its mark.

The UK's third largest grocer after market leader Tesco and No. 2 Sainsbury's said sales at stores open over a year fell 2.8 percent, excluding fuel, in its fiscal first quarter.

That compared to a decline of 2.9 percent in the previous quarter. [nL8N1G63PS]

"When normalizing for Leap Day last year and a later Easter, we continued to see sequential improvement in comp sales," Wal-Mart said.

It said Asda was beginning to see improved customer traffic numbers and basket sizes as strategic investments were made.

Wal-Mart's first-quarter comparable sales beat estimates - 路透新闻

{{20170518T111243.844+0000}}Wal-Mart's first-quarter comparable sales beat estimatesCHICAGO, May 18 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc reported higher-than-expected quarterly comparable sales on Thursday, helped by greater traffic at Wal-Mart and Sam's Club stores and a rise in online sales.

Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 1.4 percent in the first quarter, excluding fuel. Analysts polled by research firm Consesus Metrix had forecast a rise of 1.3 percent.

Earnings per share for the world's largest retailer rose to $1 in the quarter ended April 30, from 98 cents per share in the same period a year ago. Consolidated net income fell to $3.04 billion from $3.08 billion due to an increase in the tax rate.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the world's No. 1 retailer, is likely to report its eleventh straight quarterly increase in sales when it releases its first-quarter earnings. Sales may have been lifted by an uptick in spending by low-income consumers and the company's $2.7 billion investment in wages, which has led to better stocked shelves, more staffing at checkout registers and improved customer service.

Chinese online retail giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd is expected to report a jump in fourth-quarter revenue. Analysts expect strong Chinese retail data and improvements in its Taobao marketplace to boost results. Investors will also keep an eye on the progress of AliPay and the company's efforts in the online payments industry.

The U.S. Labor Department is likely to announce that initial claims for state unemployment benefits have risen to 240,000 for the week ended May 13 after dropping to 236,000 the week before. Continued jobless claims are seen increasing to 1.96 million, from 1.92 million a week earlier.

Cloud-based software maker Salesforce.com Inc is expected to report a rise in first-quarter revenue. However, the company has said it expects the impact of deferrals on revenue to be steeper in the first quarter. Salesforce, which faces rising competition from Oracle Corp and Microsoft Corp, has been shifting focus to artificial intelligence to add to its cloud-based offerings and gain market share.

Apparel retailer Gap Inc's efforts to revamp its business are paying off, with the company forecasting comparable sales to be flat to up slightly in 2017, reversing two years of declines. The company, which will report its first-quarter results, is likely to see a slight rise in net sales, helped by its Athleta brand and leaner inventory in spite of a glum retail environment.

Luxury apparel maker Ralph Lauren Corp will report its fourth-quarter earnings. The company, which is amid a management transition, is expected to post a further decline in quarterly wholesale and retail revenue as the company is stuck in a tough retail climate. Investors will be looking out for any changes or new appointments to the company's management and any changes to its cost-cutting plan.

Drug distributor McKesson Corp will report fourth-quarter results and investors will focus on concerns over declining generic drug prices and slowing pace of branded drug prices. The pharma supply chain, including pharmacy benefit managers and drug distributors, has come under pressure as scrutiny over soaring drug prices has increased.

Mexico's central bank will publish its monetary policy decision after raising the key interest rate for the fifth time in a row in late-March, taking borrowing costs to an eight-year high of 6.50 percent. Most of the bank's board members think they have tightened borrowing costs enough to contain the risks from a slump in the peso and a hike in gasoline prices with the March rate hike, according to minutes of the meeting released in April. The central bank is likely to keep its benchmark interest rate on hold as the peso has strengthened against the dollar, although above-target inflation might tip the balance.

USA-Lidl déclare la guerre des prix à ses concurrents - 路透新闻

{{20170517T164556.307+0000}}USA-Lidl déclare la guerre des prix à ses concurrentsNEW YORK, 17 mai (Reuters) - Le groupe allemand de supermarchés à bas coûts Lidl, qui va ouvrir cet été ses premiers magasins aux Etats-Unis, a annoncé que ses produits seraient jusqu'à 50% moins chers que ceux de ses concurrents, déjà engagés dans une guerre des prix.

"C'est le bon moment pour nous d'entrer aux Etats-Unis", a déclaré à Reuters le directeur général de la branche américaine du distributeur, Brendan Proctor, à l'occasion d'une rencontre avec la presse mardi soir.

"Nous avons confiance dans notre modèle. Nous nous adaptons vite, donc la question n'est pas de savoir si le marché nous convient, mais réellement de savoir ce que nous ferons pour que cela fonctionne."

Lidl, qui gère 10.000 magasins dans 27 pays, et son concurrent allemand Aldi ont déjà bousculé les grands noms de la distribution en Grande-Bretagne, comme Tesco et Asda, filiale de Wal-Mart Stores .

Lidl a précisé qu'il ouvrirait ses 20 premiers supermarchés en Caroline du Nord, en Caroline du Sud et en Virginie à partir du 15 juin et 80 autres devraient suivre au cours de la première année. Quelque 5.000 postes seront créés, a ajouté Proctor.

Selon les analystes, le groupe exploitera plus de 330 magasins aux Etats-unis d'ici 2020.

UPDATE 3-Target optimistic on full-year forecast after profit beat - 路透新闻

* Adj. profit of $1.21/shr vs. est. $0.91/shr

* Shares up 3 pct

(Adds details, analyst comment, shares)

By Sruthi Ramakrishnan and Siddharth Cavale

May 17 (Reuters) - Target Corp reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and sales and set an optimistic tone for the year, saying its full-year profit could come in at the higher end of its forecast.

Target's shares rose 3 percent on Wednesday as the outlook allayed some investor concerns following the company's warning just three months ago that its full-year targets were too high.

The company has been trying to turn around its business for several years and in February vowed to aggressively promote its products and keep grocery prices low to better compete with Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Amazon.com Inc .

Target is also focusing on opening smaller-format outlets and is investing heavily in its e-commerce business. [nL3N1GD458]

The company's online sales rose 22 percent in the first quarter, with the retailer shipping more than 27 percent of those orders from its stores.

Target said it invested $500 million as part of its turnaround strategy in the first quarter, and was on track to invest more than $2 billion this year on analytics, supply chain and opening 100 more small-format stores in urban neighborhoods and college markets.

Some analysts, however, were not impressed by these efforts.

"Q1 does not show signs of major investments, nor does Q2 guidance," Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman wrote in a note.

Gutman, noting a marginal decline in gross margins, said the investments do not seem meaningful for a retailer that has touted "systemwide price investments" and is experiencing a higher mix of online sales.

Gross margins fell to 30.5 percent from 30.9 percent.

On a post earnings call with analysts, Chief Executive Brian Cornell said it would take time for turnaround to take hold. "Our results are not where we want them to be," he said.

Sales at Target stores open at least a year fell 1.3 percent in the first quarter, rounding up a year of same-store sales declines. Analysts had expected a 3.6 percent decline, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.

A rise in demand for swimwear and electronic items such as the Nintendo Switch gaming console as well as the strong performance of its smaller-format stores helped the company beat Wall Street's muted profit and sales estimates.

Excluding items, Target earned a profit of $1.21 per share, while revenue fell 1.1 percent to $16.02 billion. [nBw8CyRPra]

Analysts on average had expected earnings of 91 cents per share on revenue of $15.62 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Target said the higher-than-expected performance in the first quarter had increased the probability that its full-year results would come above the midpoint of its prior forecast for adjusted profit of $3.80-$4.20 per share.

Germany's Lidl to price groceries up to 50 pct below U.S. rivals - 路透新闻

{{20170517T160000.891+0000}}Germany's Lidl to price groceries up to 50 pct below U.S. rivalsBy Nandita Bose

NEW YORK, May 17 (Reuters) - German discount grocery chain Lidl, which is opening its first U.S. stores this summer, said its products would be up to 50 percent cheaper than competitors, which are already caught up in a price war.

"This is the right time for us to enter the United States," Brendan Proctor, chief executive officer for Lidl U.S., told Reuters at a media event in New York late on Tuesday. "We are confident in our model. We adapt quickly, so it's not about whether a market works for us but really about what we will do to make it work."

Lidl, which runs 10,000 stores in 27 countries, and German rival Aldi Inc have already upended Britain's grocery retail market, hurting incumbents like Tesco Plc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc's ASDA supermarket chain. [nL1N1IE25L]

Lidl said it would open its first 20 U.S. stores in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, starting on June 15. Eighty more will follow in the United States within the first year, which Procter said would create 5,000 jobs. .

Analysts estimate the company will have more than 330 U.S. stores by 2020.

The stores will be 20,000 square feet in size and have only six aisles. The retailer's in-house brands will account for 90 percent of the products.

The first 100 stores are newly constructed standalone retail properties that Lidl owns and developed. The company is open to leasing locations as it opens new stores, Proctor said.

As Reuters first reported, Wal-Mart is running price tests in 11 U.S. states, pushing vendors to undercut rivals by 15 percent, and Aldi is aiming for prices 21 percent below its U.S. competition. [nL1N1G91ME][nL1N1ID07D]

Trabajadoras dicen Wal-Mart discriminó a miles de mujeres embarazadas - 路透新闻

{{20170515T214916.852+0000}}Trabajadoras dicen Wal-Mart discriminó a miles de mujeres embarazadasPor Daniel Wiessner

15 mayo (Reuters) - Dos exempleadas de Wal-Mart Stores Inc presentaron una demanda acusando al minorista de tratar a miles de mujeres embarazadas como "ciudadanos de segunda clase" al rechazar sus pedidos para limitar el levantamiento de paquetes pesados, subir escaleras y otras tareas potencialmente peligrosas.

La demanda colectiva propuesta fue presentada el viernes en una corte federal en Illinois por Talisa Borders y Otisha Woolbright, quienes dijeron que hasta el 2014 Wal-Mart tenía una política general que negaba a las mujeres embarazadas las mismas comodidades que a personas con otras necesidades especiales.

La demanda colectiva podría incluir al menos a 20.000 mujeres y posiblemente hasta 50.000 que trabajaron en Wal-Mart durante su embarazo antes del cambio de política, según dice la acción judicial.

La compañía negó los reclamos de las mujeres en un comunicado entregado por su portavoz Randy Hargrove, y dijo que las políticas de embarazo de Wal-Mart "siempre han cumplido o superado los requisitos de las leyes estatales o federales".

La empresa aseguró que otra de sus políticas, en este caso una contra la discriminación, considera al embarazo como una condición protegida. "Walmart es un grandioso lugar de trabajo para las mujeres", dijo la compañía.

Borders y Woolbright dicen que la vieja política de Wal-Mart violaba una ley federal que exige a los empleadores que traten al embarazo como una discapacidad temporal y brinden las comodidades necesarias a las mujeres embarazadas.

En un caso del 2015 que involucró a United Parcel Service (UPS), la Corte Suprema de Estados Unidos dijo que los empleadores no pueden tratar a las trabajadoras embarazadas de forma diferente a quienes tienen otras discapacidades o condiciones médicas.

Wal-Mart, el mayor empleador privado de Estados Unidos, cambió su política en el 2014 para tratar al embarazo como una discapacidad. Pero los abogados de las demandantes dicen que los cambios son insuficientes y que planean una acción judicial independiente contra la nueva política.

Workers say Wal-Mart discriminated against thousands of pregnant women - Reuters Health eLine

{{20170515T193059.579+0000}}Workers say Wal-Mart discriminated against thousands of pregnant womenWALMART-LAWSUIT/PREGNANCY (UPDATE 1):Workers say Wal-Mart discriminated against thousands of pregnant women

(Reuters) - Two former Wal-Mart Stores Inc employees have filed a lawsuit accusing the retailer of treating thousands of pregnant workers as "second-class citizens" by rejecting their requests to limit heavy lifting, climbing on ladders and other potentially dangerous tasks.

The proposed class action lawsuit was filed in federal court in Illinois on Friday by Talisa Borders and Otisha Woolbright, who say that until 2014, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart had a company-wide policy that denied pregnant women the same accommodations as workers with other disabilities.

The class could include at least 20,000 women and possibly up to 50,000 who worked at Wal-Mart while pregnant before the policy change, according to the lawsuit.

The company in a statement provided by spokesman Randy Hargrove denied the women's claims and said Wal-Mart's pregnancy policies "have always fully met or exceeded both state and federal law." The company said a separate anti-discrimination policy it maintains has long listed pregnancy as a protected status.

"Walmart is a great place for women to work," the company said.

Borders and Woolbright say that Wal-Mart's old policy violated a federal law requiring employers to treat pregnancy as a temporary disability and provide work accommodations to pregnant women. The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 2015 case involving United Parcel Service, said employers cannot treat pregnant workers differently from those with other disabilities or medical conditions.

Wal-Mart, the largest private U.S. employer, changed its policy in 2014 to treat pregnancy as a disability. But lawyers for the plaintiffs in the lawsuit say the changes did not go far enough, and they were planning a separate lawsuit involving the new policy.

Woolbright says her manager at a Florida Wal-Mart told her pregnancy was "no excuse" for not doing heavy lifting. She says she was fired from her job in the deli department after injuring herself lifting trays that weighed up to 50 pounds and inquiring further about the company's pregnancy policies.

UPDATE 1-Workers say Wal-Mart discriminated against thousands of pregnant women - 路透新闻

{{20170515T183027.303+0000}}UPDATE 1-Workers say Wal-Mart discriminated against thousands of pregnant women(Adds comment from Wal-Mart)

By Daniel Wiessner

May 15 (Reuters) - Two former Wal-Mart Stores Inc employees have filed a lawsuit accusing the retailer of treating thousands of pregnant workers as "second-class citizens" by rejecting their requests to limit heavy lifting, climbing on ladders and other potentially dangerous tasks.

The proposed class action lawsuit was filed in federal court in Illinois on Friday by Talisa Borders and Otisha Woolbright, who say that until 2014, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart had a company-wide policy that denied pregnant women the same accommodations as workers with other disabilities.

The class could include at least 20,000 women and possibly up to 50,000 who worked at Wal-Mart while pregnant before the policy change, according to the lawsuit.

The company in a statement provided by spokesman Randy Hargrove denied the women's claims and said Wal-Mart's pregnancy policies "have always fully met or exceeded both state and federal law." The company said a separate anti-discrimination policy it maintains has long listed pregnancy as a protected status.

"Walmart is a great place for women to work," the company said.

Borders and Woolbright say that Wal-Mart's old policy violated a federal law requiring employers to treat pregnancy as a temporary disability and provide work accommodations to pregnant women. The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 2015 case involving United Parcel Service, said employers cannot treat pregnant workers differently from those with other disabilities or medical conditions.

Wal-Mart, the largest private U.S. employer, changed its policy in 2014 to treat pregnancy as a disability. But lawyers for the plaintiffs in the lawsuit say the changes did not go far enough, and they were planning a separate lawsuit involving the new policy.

Woolbright says her manager at a Florida Wal-Mart told her pregnancy was "no excuse" for not doing heavy lifting. She says she was fired from her job in the deli department after injuring herself lifting trays that weighed up to 50 pounds and inquiring further about the company's pregnancy policies.

Borders, who worked at an Illinois Wal-Mart, says she was reprimanded for asking coworkers to climb ladders and lift heavy boxes while she was pregnant, and forced to go on unpaid leave. When she returned, she says, she was paid $2.00 less per hour.

The case is Borders v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, No. 3:17-cv-00506.

RPT-Germany's Lidl prepares to enter U.S. supermarket wars - 路透新闻

{{20170515T100101.244+0000}}RPT-Germany's Lidl prepares to enter U.S. supermarket wars(Repeats May 12 story for wider readership)

By Nandita Bose

CHICAGO, May 12 (Reuters) - German discount supermarket chain Lidl is set to open its first set of U.S. stores this summer, raising the stakes for American grocery chain operators who have been caught in an intense price war.

Lidl said in February it planned to open its first 20 U.S. stores in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, with 80 more to follow in the United States within the first year.

Lidl's entry comes at a time when Wal-Mart Stores Inc is running price tests in 11 states, pushing vendors to undercut rivals by 15 percent. The world's biggest retailer is expected to spend about $6 billion to regain its title as the low-price leader, analysts said. [nL1N1G91ME]

Another rival, German discounter Aldi Inc [ALDIEI.UL], is aiming for prices 21 percent below its U.S. competition and is aggressively expanding its presence. [nL1N1ID07D]

Lidl and Aldi have already upended Britain's grocery retail market, hurting incumbents like Tesco Plc and ASDA, the British supermarket arm of Wal-Mart.

Lidl (which rhymes with "needle") is owned by Germany's privately held Schwarz Group. It operates more than 10,000 stores in 27 countries.

The German chain's U.S. CEO, Brendan Proctor, will address Lidl's U.S. expansion plans at a New York press event on Tuesday.

According to the company's website, it is hiring workers in 38 cities in the eastern U.S. states of Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Virginia.

"The growth of Aldi and Lidl will require existing U.S. grocery retailers to start asking themselves how they can do things differently to control costs – from marketing and merchandising to operations and logistics," Bill Bishop, co-founder of retail consultancy Bricks Meets Clicks, said in an interview on Friday.

Lidl is expected to post U.S. sales of roughly $1 billion in 2018, $2 billion in 2019 and $4 billion 2020, assuming it opens just under 100 stores per year, according to a recent note by retail think tank Fung Global Retail and Technology.

This would put Lidl in close range of U.S. grocery chains like Ingles market, which had revenue of $3.2 billion in 2016; Sprouts Farmers Market with $4.3 billion in sales last year and SuperValu Inc , which posted sales of $4.8 billion, the report said.

Analyst estimates suggest Lidl is eyeing more than 330 U.S stores by 2020. The retailer has opened three distribution centers in Maryland, North Carolina and Virginia.

HINTERGRUND-Amazon triumphiert im Kampf der "Shopping-Bots" - 路透新闻

{{20170514T112307.840+0000}}HINTERGRUND-Amazon triumphiert im Kampf der "Shopping-Bots"* Handelskonzerne setzen Spähprogramme aufeinander an

* Insider - Amazon brachte Wal-Mart eine Cyber-Niederlage bei

* Oft werden Preise mehrmals täglich neu kalkuliert

- von Jeffrey Dastin

San Francisco, 14. Mai (Reuters) - Der Konkurrenzkampf im Internet-Handel verlagert sich immer stärker an die Technologiefront. Weil schon Preisunterschiede von 50 Cent über Wohl und Wehe der Absätze entscheiden können, setzt die Branche zum Ausspähen von Rivalen mehr und mehr trickreiche Roboterprogramme ein. Mit diesen sogenannten Bots - von Computern erzeugten Identitäten, die sich als Kaufinteressenten ausgeben - durchforsten die Online-Händler das Sortiment der Konkurrenz, um auf Preisunterschiede so schnell wie möglich reagieren zu können. Die Gegenseite nutzt immer ausgefeiltere Abwehrtechniken. "Das ist ein Rüstungswettlauf", sagt Branchenexperte Keith Anderson vom irischen Analysehaus Profitero. "Jede Woche oder jeden Monat gibt es neue Vorstöße von beiden Seiten." Amazon, der weltgrößte Online-Händler, ist Insidern zufolge auch hier dominierend.

So erlebte Anfang Januar der US-Einzelhandelsgigant Wal-Mart eine böse Überraschung. Sein Programm, das täglich millionenfach die Preise von Amazon sichtet, stellte plötzlich die Arbeit ein. Wochenlang konnte es laut Insidern nicht auf die Amazon-Preise zugreifen, Wal-Mart war den Angaben zufolge gezwungen, auf kostspielige Dienste eines anderen Anbieters zurückzugreifen. Der lange Zeit unbekannte Vorfall ist ein Beleg für die technische Vormacht von Amazon, die dem Konzern beim Festigen seiner Führungsrolle im Online-Handel hilft. Dank der Abwehrtechnik kann Amazon seine Rivalen über die eigenen Preise im Dunkeln lassen und sich zugleich durch eigene Späh-Bots einen Vorteil verschaffen.

In diesem Fall nutzten die Preisspione von Wal-Mart den Insidern zufolge offenbar einen speziellen Internet-Browser für Programmierer. Dies war wohl ein Alarmsignal für die Kontrolleure bei Amazon, dass hier keine echten Käufer das Sortiment begutachteten, sondern Bots. Amazon verbarg sein Angebot daraufhin mit einer Art digitalem Vorhang vor dem Zugriff der Spähprogramme.

KATZ-UND-MAUS-SPIEL DER ONLINE-HÄNDLER

An manchen Tagen gehen rund 80 Prozent der Clicks auf Produkte bei Amazon auf Bots zurück. Dabei handelt es sich neben den Preisspähern häufig um branchenspezifische Forschungen, Suchmaschinen, Werbedienste, aber auch um Hacker und Online-Betrüger, die Kunden-Konten im Visier haben. Auch Google verwendet solcher Roboter-Programme, um Ergebnisse für seine Suchmaschine zu liefern. Umstritten sind sie vor allem bei der Meinungsmache in Online-Netzwerken wie Facebook oder den Kommentarfunktionen von Medien.

Im Internethandel führen sie immer mehr zu einem Katz-und-Maus-Spiel. Während herkömmliche Händler ihre Preise wegen des Aufwands und der Kosten gewöhnlich nicht mehr als einmal wöchentlich ändern, wird in der Welt des E-Commerce oft mehrmals täglich nachjustiert. Hier kommen Programme zum Einsatz, die Lagerbestände, Absatzprognosen und die Preise der Konkurrenz in ihre Kalkulation einbeziehen. So greifen Online-Unternehmen wie der US-Großhändler Boxed, der etwa Toilettenpapier und Tiernahrung an Großabnehmer verkauft, auf verschiedenste Techniken zurück, um auch alle 20 Minuten über Preisschritte der Konkurrenz im Bilde zu sein. "Gerade während des Weihnachtsgeschäfts ist das eine Ewigkeit", sagt Firmenchef Chieh Huang. "Wenn wir keine anständigen Preise haben, bekommen wir das sofort zu spüren."

Um zwischen Bots und echten Kunden zu unterscheiden, nutzen viele Online-Händler die sogenannte "Captcha"-Technik. Hier müssen Nutzer für den Zugang zu einer Internet-Seite eine vorgegebene Kombination aus Buchstaben und Zahlen eingeben, die nur Menschen lesen können, nicht aber Roboter. Amazon verzichtet allerdings auf diese Zugangskontrolle - um seine Kunden nicht zu vergraulen.

WEEK AHEAD

Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the world's No. 1 retailer, will report first-quarter earnings on Thursday. Last month, the company said it would be cutting "hundreds" of corporate jobs in its international and technology businesses, along with its Sam's Club warehouse chain.

On Tuesday, investors will get a look at the U.S. Commerce Department's housing starts number for April, which is likely to have risen to 1.26 million units from 1.22 million units in March. Additionally, building permits for April are expected to read 1.27 million units. On the same day, the Federal Reserve will release data on industrial production, which is expected to have slowed to 0.3 percent in April from 0.5 percent the month before. Manufacturing output for April is likely to pick up pace at 0.3 percent after a 0.4 percent drop in March. The U.S. Philly Fed Business Index for May is due on Thursday and is expected to drop to 19.8 from 22 in April. The U.S. Labor Department's weekly jobless claims data is also due on Thursday.

Retailer Target Corp will report first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. The company has forecast a profit below Wall Street estimates and said it would lower prices to compete with rivals such as Wal-Mart and Amazon. Target has also said many of its stores need freshening up and that it will invest in technology and small stores to win back market share.

Leaders from 29 countries will attend the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing on Sunday and Monday, an event orchestrated to promote President Xi Jinping's vision of expanding links between Asia, Africa and Europe underpinned by billions of dollars in infrastructure investment. Some of China's most reliable allies and partners will attend the forum, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen and Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev.

On Tuesday, TJX Cos Inc, the operator of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores, will report its first-quarter earnings. The company had forecast quarterly comparable sales to grow 0-1 percent. The company has remained a bright spot in the lackluster retail environment as bargain-hungry shoppers turn away from department stores and other mall-based chains to the discounted offerings that the retailer sells.

Home Depot Inc, the biggest U.S. home improvement retailer, reports first-quarter earnings on Tuesday. The company has forecast 2017 sales ahead of Wall Street estimates, remaining a bright spot in the retail sector as a firming economy, higher wages and an increase in the value of homes have spurred remodeling activity by homeowners.

Apparel retailer Gap Inc's efforts on revamping its logo-centric design of clothes are paying off as the company said in the last quarter that it expected comparable sales to be flat to up slightly in 2017, reversing two straight years of declines. Gap's net sales are likely to rise slightly, helped by its Athleta brand and leaner inventory in spite of a glum retail environment. The company will report its first-quarter results on Thursday.

Luxury apparel maker Ralph Lauren Corp will report its fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday. The company is expected to continue posting a sharp decline in wholesale and retail revenue as it is stuck in a tough retail climate, with consumers increasingly spending less on apparel and accessories and more on experiences such as travel and dining out. The company also saw the departure of its CEO, Stefan Larrson, in February, who had structured the Way Forward plan, which included cutting jobs and shuttering stores to improve profitability. Investors will be looking out for any changes or new appointments to the company's management and any changes to its Way Forward plan.

On Wednesday, teen apparel retailer American Eagle outfitters is likely to post slow first-quarter sales growth, hurt by weak demand for its men's apparel and continued softness in mall traffic. Investors might expect a strong full-year forecast by the company, given its strong denim positioning, a cautious inventory and promotional stance and its ongoing online momentum

Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester speaks on the economic outlook and monetary policy before the Economic Club of Minnesota on Thursday. On Friday, St. Louis Fed chief James Bullard gives a presentation on the U.S. economy and monetary policy before the Association for Corporate Growth St. Louis Chapter.

On Friday, Deere & Co is expected to report a decline in revenue and profit for the second quarter as weak commodity prices and low farm income in North America, its biggest market, continue to weigh on its farm equipment sales. However, Deere's profit is expected to rise, partly helped by cost-cutting measures, including job cuts and lowered production, taken in previous years. Investors will look for an update on fiscal 2017 financial forecast.

Vodafone Group Plc, the world's second-biggest mobile operator, on Tuesday publishes full-year results showing the cost of the cut-throat competition in India and challenges in its home British market that prompted it to cut its earnings guidance in February.

The world's largest networking gear maker, Cisco Systems Inc, reports its third-quarter results on Wednesday. The company is expected to post its sixth straight quarterly decline in revenue, hurt by sluggish demand in its legacy network equipment business. To offset stagnant demand for its traditional lineup of switches and routers, Cisco has been doubling down on areas such as security, the internet of things and cloud computing.

Cloud-based software maker Salesforce.com Inc is expected to report a rise in first-quarter revenue on Thursday. The company sees huge demand for its cloud-based sales and marketing software. However, Salesforce expects the impact of deferrals on revenue to be steeper in the first quarter. Salesforce, which faces competition from Oracle Corp and Microsoft Corp, has been shifting focus to artificial intelligence to add to its cloud-based offerings and gain market share.

English soccer club Manchester United Plc is expected to report a shrink in third-quarter revenue on Tuesday as absence from the lucrative Champions League is likely to impact broadcast and matchday income.

Campbell Soup Co, the world's largest soupmaker, is likely to continue posting declines in sales and profit due to weak demand for its Bolthouse Farms' carrots and V8 beverages as its C-Fresh business was hit by an early harvest of its baby carrots last year. It reports third-quarter results on Friday. The company said last quarter that it does not expect its C-Fresh business to grow for the rest of the fiscal year.

Drug distributor McKesson Corp will report fourth-quarter results on Thursday and investors will focus on concerns over declining generic drug prices and slowing pace of branded drug prices. The pharma supply chain, including pharmacy benefit managers and drug distributors, has come under pressure as scrutiny over soaring drug prices has increased.

JPMorgan Chase & Co Chairman and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon will address shareholders at the company's annual meeting on Tuesday and likely make comments about government regulations and the U.S. economy. Dimon is also expected to prevail again against a recurring shareholder referendum calling on directors to eventually separate the posts of chairman and CEO of the company. The meeting will be held in the bank's Wilmington, Delaware technology center.

The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce on Tuesday hosts a string of Canadian technology companies and a panel on artificial intelligence at an investor conference in Toronto. The attendees include BlackBerry Ltd CFO Steven Capelli and Open Text Corp CEO and CTO Mark Barrenechea.

The largest hedge fund-focused conference, the annual Skybridge Alternatives event, or SALT, kicks-off on Tuesday in Las Vegas. Major investment speakers include Bill Ackman, Jeff Gundlach, Dan Loeb, David Rubenstein, Jim Chanos, Marc Lasry and Sam Zell.

Friday will be the main day on the economic calendar in Canada next week when investors will take in April inflation data and March retail sales. Inflation figures, including the Bank of Canada's new core inflation measures, have been muted and the report is likely to reinforce expectations the central bank will remain on the sidelines for some time. The separate report on retail sales will be watched to see how consumer appetite was holding up as the economy headed into the second quarter. Also on tap next week is the March manufacturing sales report, due on Wednesday, and data on foreign investment in Canadian securities in March, due on Thursday.

On Thursday, Mexico's central bank will publish its monetary policy decision after raising it for the fifth time in a row in late-March, taking borrowing costs to an eight-year high of 6.50 percent. According to minutes of the meeting released in April, most of the bank's board members thought they had tightened borrowing costs enough to contain the risks from a slump in the peso and a hike in gasoline prices with the March rate hike.

ON MONDAY

The biggest and most high-profiled money managers and hedge fund investors in the United States, including George Soros, David Tepper, David Einhorn and Carl Icahn, will reveal in regulatory filings their first-quarter purchases and sales of such closely watched stocks and asset classes, including Snap Inc, Macy's, Wells Fargo, Tesla, Apple, Amazon.com and gold. The filings, the deadline for which is on Monday, will also reveal market trends including whether billionaire investors took money off the table in U.S. stocks, particularly financial stocks, as the "Trump Trade" began fading during the quarter.

The NAHB Housing Market Index for May is expected to remain unchanged at 68 from the month before. (1000/1400)

LATAM Airlines Group SA, the biggest carrier in South America, is due to release its first-quarter earnings. Analysts have been upgrading the stock recently on hopes of a recovery in key market Brazil.

LIVECHAT – GLOBAL WEEK AHEAD Macroeconomist, and off-hours umpire, Kim Rupert is a managing director at Action Economics and calls 'em as she sees 'em - the data due, the policymaker speeches on tap and other events likely to affect global markets in the week ahead.

LPC: Coach's Kate Spade buy offers retail M&A blueprint - Reuters News

{{20170512T154341.753+0000}}LPC: Coach's Kate Spade buy offers retail M&A blueprintBy Lynn Adler and Leela Parker Deo

NEW YORK, May 12 (Reuters) - Handbag maker Coach Inc's US$2.4bn purchase of designer and smaller luxury handbag and accessories maker Kate Spade & Co, backed by up to US$2.1bn in bank loans, shows that US retailers are opening their purses to buy rivals to boost profits, bankers and analysts said.

More mergers and acquisitions designed to bolster competitiveness would drive up retail M&A lending, after a 66% drop in 2016 to US$18bn from US$53bn in 2015 as the sector continues to face stiff challenges from online retailers.

"As more retailers feel pressured to grow revenue and profitability in a very challenging retail environment, equity markets remain robust and access to capital remains fairly cheap, M&A activity will continue and even accelerate," said Mickey Chadha, senior credit officer at Moody's Investors Service.

Coach, which has investment-grade ratings of Baa2 by Moody's, BBB by Fitch and BBB- by S&P, was put on alert for a possible downgrade by Moody's and Fitch, based on the added debt it is taking on for the purchase.

Kate Spade's non-investment grade credit ratings of Ba3 by Moody's and BB- by S&P could be revised upward after the acquisition on an improved financial risk profile.

Two days after the announcement of Coach's acquisition of Kate Spade, clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch Co said it is in preliminary talks with several companies interested in a tie-up.

"Reasons (for retail mergers) could range from product and geographic diversification to adding online capabilities – for example PetSmart and Chewy or Wal-Mart and Jet.com – to cost savings to simply taking out a competitor," Chadha said.

PetSmart Inc, operator of more than 1,500 pet stores, agreed to buy online pet retailer Chewy Inc in April, and Wal-Mart Stores Inc purchased e-commerce company Jet.com last August to boost their online business.

Coach secured a commitment from Bank of America Merrill Lynch for up to US$2.1bn under a 364-day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility to finance its Kate Spade buy. Coach has US$4.5bn of global revenue, according to Moody's.

Coach plans to put permanent funding in place via an US$800m six-month loan and a US$300m three-year loan as well as US$1bn of senior unsecured notes before the merger closes, which is expected in the third quarter.

WALKING DOWN THE AISLES

Mergers driven by cost savings make sense even for retailers without immediate financial pressures, amid declining traffic to brick and mortar stores, and heavy sales promotions as well as weak teen spending on apparel, according to Moody's.

Competition in the sector has pulled median secondary bids for US retail loans lower since the start of the year to 99.1 on May 11 from 99.9 on January 4, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data, and could erode further if bankruptcies accelerate, several bankers said.

"Payless (ShoeSource) filed for bankruptcy protection in April, J Crew's term loan is trading in the 60s, and there's a lot of concern about mid-level retail stores that are in the malls in particular," a senior banker said.

Retail companies looking to bolster e-commerce and overcome difficult store locations and other issues make strategic corporate marriages increasingly likely, and could encourage more investment-grade retailers to snap up junk-rated rivals following Coach and Kate Spade's example, according to the banker.

"We'll see a lot of M&A if there is value in the franchise, if the name carries panache and interest by customers," he said. "Kate Spade is one of those."

Investors are, however, braced for further bad news from the retail sector, particularly from apparel retailers in coming months.

"I don't think that we've really seen the volatility that we could if the retail sector was to start to experience a decline, and I think that's what is going to happen in the sector sometime this year," one investor said.

Une juge US ordonne au DG de Wal-Mart de témoigner sur le Mexique - 路透新闻

{{20170511T214655.796+0000}}Une juge US ordonne au DG de Wal-Mart de témoigner sur le MexiqueNEW YORK, 11 mai (Reuters) - Une juge fédérale américaine a ordonné jeudi au directeur général de Wal-Mart Stores , Douglas McMillon, de témoigner dans le cadre d'une plainte déposée par des actionnaires désireux d'apprendre ce qu'il savait de faits présumés de corruption au Mexique de la part du numéro un mondial de la distribution.

La juge Susan Hickey, dans l'Arkansas, a déclaré que "l'implication directe et personnelle" de Douglas McMillon sur des points motivant cette action en nom collectif ("class action") justifiait qu'il lui soit demandé de répondre aux questions des avocats des actionnaires.

Douglas McMillon présidait Wal-Mart International durant la période au cours de laquelle, selon ces actionnaires, le géant américain de la distribution a dissimulé aux autorités des faits présumés de corruption de la part de sa filiale au Mexique dans le but d'accélérer son développement dans ce pays.

Wal-Mart, dont le siège est dans l'Arkansas, a défendu pour sa part que Douglas McMillon ne possédait pas une "connaissance unique ou particulière" telle qu'elle justifie une déposition de sa part.

La juge a au contraire souligné que Douglas McMillon, directeur général depuis février 2014, avait participé à plusieurs réunions, vu des dizaines de communications et s'était publiquement exprimé à de nombreuses reprises au sujet de cette corruption présumée.

"Il apparaît au tribunal que McMillon dispose d'une connaissance unique des questions relatives à cette affaire que lui seul est en mesure d'expliquer", a écrit la juge.

Un porte-parole de Wal-Mart a dit que le groupe examinait ce jugement et réfléchissait à ses futures initiatives.

La capitalisation boursière de Wal-Mart a fondu de 17 milliards de dollars (15,65 milliards d'euros) en trois jours en avril 2012 lorsque le New York Times a fait état de cette corruption présumée et rapporté que ces faits étaient connus en interne depuis 2005.

UPDATE 1-Wal-Mart CEO to be questioned in U.S. lawsuit over Mexican bribery - 路透新闻

{{20170511T205806.951+0000}}UPDATE 1-Wal-Mart CEO to be questioned in U.S. lawsuit over Mexican bribery(Adds Wal-Mart comment)

By Jonathan Stempel

May 11 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday ordered Wal-Mart Stores Inc Chief Executive Douglas McMillon to submit to questioning in a lawsuit by shareholders hoping to learn what he knows about suspected bribery by the world's largest retailer in Mexico.

U.S. District Judge Susan Hickey in Fayetteville, Arkansas, said McMillon's "direct and personal involvement" in matters underlying a class-action lawsuit justified requiring him to sit for a deposition by the shareholders' lawyers.

McMillon had been president of Wal-Mart International during a period when shareholders led by a Michigan pension fund said the retailer concealed suspected bribery by its Wal-Mart de Mexico unit to government officials, to speed up store openings.

The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer had argued that McMillon lacked the "unique or special knowledge" to justify burdening him with a deposition.

But the judge said McMillon, who became chief executive in February 2014, took part in several meetings, saw dozens of communications, and had certified many public statements by Wal-Mart about the alleged bribery.

"It appears to the court that McMillon has unique knowledge of relevant issues in this litigation that only he can explain," Hickey wrote. A deposition could last four hours, she added.

Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove said: "We are reviewing the order and contemplating our next steps."

Jason Forge, a lawyer for the lead plaintiff City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System, said in an email: "We're determined to try this case in court."

Wal-Mart's market value slid $17 billion over three days in April 2012 after the New York Times reported the alleged bribery and said it had been first discovered internally in 2005.

Shareholders accused Wal-Mart and Mike Duke, who preceded McMillon as chief executive, of downplaying the scheme even after learning about the Times' investigation.

The class period runs from Dec. 8, 2011 to April 20, 2012.

Earlier this week, Bloomberg News said Wal-Mart may pay about $300 million to settle a U.S. government probe into suspected bribery in Mexico, India and China, citing people familiar with the matter. [nL1N1IB1QB]

A $300 million payment would represent about one week of profit for Wal-Mart.

The case is City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System v. Wal-Mart Stores Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Western District of Arkansas, No. 12-05162.

RPT-EXCLUSIVE-Aldi raises stakes in U.S. price war with Wal-Mart - 路透新闻

{{20170511T110002.472+0000}}RPT-EXCLUSIVE-Aldi raises stakes in U.S. price war with Wal-Mart(Repeats to additional customers with no changes to text)

By Nandita Bose

WHEATON, Ill., May 11 (Reuters) - German grocery chain Aldi Inc is trying to beat the world's biggest retailer at its own game: low prices.

Already with 1,600 U.S. stores, Aldi's internal studies show its prices are 21 percent lower than its lowest-priced rivals, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc , according to Chief Executive Jason Hart. He plans to maintain that gap going forward.

His strategy, previously unreported, centers on adding more private-label goods, which are a retailer's in-house brands, to win over price-sensitive customers, and a massive expansion to further disrupt a U.S. grocery sector that has seen 18 companies go bankrupt since 2014.

Hart's plan calls for spending $1.6 billion to expand and remodel 1,300 U.S. stores, and open 400 new stores mainly in Florida, Texas and on both coasts by end of 2018. He also pledged Aldi will be willing to change prices more frequently to respond to rivals if needed.

"We are re-merchandising, remodeling, enhancing our product range and are focused on gaining volume so more customers start their shopping at Aldi and we are able to complete their shopping lists moreso than we have in the past," said Hart, who added Aldi's U.S. sales have doubled in five years.

Though it only accounts for only about 1.5 percent of the U.S. grocery market, Aldi is growing at 15 percent a year, whereas Wal-Mart currently controls about 22 percent of the market and its U.S. sales are estimated to grow about 2 percent this year, according to analysts.

Aldi's growth potential has competitors taking notice. Reuters reported in February that Wal-Mart is running price tests in 11 states, pushing vendors to undercut Aldi and other rivals by 15 percent and is expected to spend about $6 billion to regain its title as the low-price leader.

Price wars are roiling the entire retail sector - from department stores to discount chains - but it is nowhere as intense as in the grocery sector. Beyond Wal-Mart's move to match Aldi on price, German discount chain Lidl plans to open up to a 100 U.S. stores in a year, and Amazon.com Inc is aggressively testing out various brick-and-mortar grocery formats along with growing Amazon Fresh, its grocery delivery service.

"We have not seen anything like this in the grocery sector in the United States before," said Scott Mushkin, managing director of Wolfe Research and a leading pricing analyst.

Such heated competition risks a dangerous race to the bottom that could result in more retailers shutting their doors.

"Given Aldi's expansion, Lidl's entry, Wal-Mart's response and Amazon's growing ambitions in this space, it is fair to expect a significant acceleration in the bankruptcy and liquidation cycle in this sector over the next few years," said Burt Flickinger, managing director at retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group.

GOAL: EVERYDAY LOW PRICING

Aldi, has a simple strategy to win more customers: everyday low pricing, according to Hart.

"We don't confuse our customers with yo-yo discounts, sales, coupons and loyalty cards that require membership fees," he said.

Four analysts and consultants contacted by Reuters confirmed Aldi now offers the lowest prices in private label consumer products in the states it operates, although they did say Wal-Mart is gaining ground in the states they are conducting price tests.

Depending on the product, Aldi's prices are cheaper than most rivals' private label items and even most branded items, analysts said. Hart said the 21 percent difference in price is calculated by monitoring competition on a basket of groceries.

Aldi counts on its no-frills shopping experience to help keep costs low, and limits much of its inventory to items that sell in huge volume. But its focus on offering far more private label items than branded products is central to allowing Aldi to adjust pricing whenever it chooses, Hart said.

Aldi and Wal-Mart do no break out the figures, but analysts including Mushkin and Flickinger say Aldi carries about 1,200 stock keeping units (SKUs) or type of products, 90 percent of which are private label. Wal-Mart stocks about 30,000-40,000 SKU's of products similar to ones Aldi sells, and only 30 percent of that are private labels.

That different product mix can potentially make it more difficult for Wal-Mart to adjust prices because it often first needs buy-in from suppliers, and many times faces push back from packaged goods makers like Procter & Gamble , Unilever and even smaller brands. Such vendors fear steep discounting can erode the value of their brands, analysts said.

A Wal-Mart spokesman declined comment, saying the company would not comment on a competitor's strategy. P&G and Unilever did not respond to Reuters requests seeking comment.

But the explosive growth in private label products is on the radar of Wal-Mart Chief Executive Doug McMillon. Last month he told analysts that private label goods will play an even more important role as the widespread availability of branded products online will compress those products margins over time.

"Aldi is disrupting the sector the way Wal-Mart did when they started," said Strategic Resource Group's Flickinger.

STEPPING UP THE GAME

Aldi's aggressive push to remodel its stores will allow it to add new private label merchandise in rapidly growing categories like fresh food.

"The remodels are aimed at increasing our volumes which means more purchasing power that will help us lower prices further," said Scott Patton, Aldi's vice president of corporate buying.

At a recent visit to an Aldi store in Wheaton, Illinois Reuters found newer-looking shelves, wider aisles and brighter lighting than a typical Aldi store. There was also a bigger assortment of fresh, organic, gluten-free products and antibiotic-free meats versus what it stocked earlier - categories Aldi said is growing the most rapidly at its stores.

For example, its Simply Nature range of private-label products grew 53 percent to $300 million in 2016 from a year ago.

Aldi has also opened stores close to Wal-Mart's supercenters to benefit from its budget-conscious shoppers. Its total store count of 2,000 stores by the end of next year will be about 42 percent of Wal-Mart's U.S. store base.

Aldi expandiert in USA und verschärft Preiskampf mit Wal-Mart - 路透新闻

{{20170511T085951.117+0000}}Aldi expandiert in USA und verschärft Preiskampf mit Wal-Mart- von Nandita Bose

Wheaton, 11. Mai (Reuters) - Aldi geht in den USA mit einem milliardenschweren Investitionsprogramm auf Expansionskurs und verschärft den Preiskampf mit Wal-Mart. Um dem Weltmarktführer im Einzelhandel auf seinem Heimatmarkt Kunden abzujagen, nimmt die in den USA bereits mit 1600 Filialen vertretene deutsche Discount-Kette 1,6 Milliarden Dollar in die Hand. US-Chef Jason Hart will damit nach eigenen Angaben bis Ende nächsten Jahres 400 neue Aldi-Märkte vor allem in Florida und Texas sowie an der Ost- und Westküste eröffnen. 1300 bestehende Geschäfte sollen zudem erweitert und modernisiert werden. In die Regale will Hart zugleich mehr günstige Eigenmarken stellen, deren Preise problemlos und schnell weiter gesenkt werden können - wenn beispielsweise Wal-Mart versucht, Aldi zu unterbieten.

Interne Studien zeigen dem US-Aldi-Chef zufolge, dass seine Supermärkte die Preise auch der günstigsten Rivalen - darunter Wal-Mart - bereits jetzt im Schnitt um gut ein Fünftel unterbieten. Mit der neuen Offensive wollen die Deutschen den ebenfalls für Billig-Shopping bekannten Branchenriesen aber noch stärker unter Druck setzen. Schon zuletzt lief es nicht schlecht für Aldi Inc. Zwar hält das Unternehmen am US-Lebensmittelmarkt gerade einmal rund 1,5 Prozent, während Wal-Mart etwa 22 Prozent kontrolliert. Doch der seit mehr als 40 Jahren in den USA vertretene Aldi-Ableger mit Sitz im Großraum Chicago kann eine Wachstumsrate von jährlich 15 Prozent aufweisen, während Wal-Mart seinen Umsatz 2017 nach Analystenschätzungen nur um rund zwei Prozent erhöhen dürfte.

Wal-Mart ist bereits aufgeschreckt. Der Konzern prüft in elf Bundesstaaten systematisch die Preise der Konkurrenz[nL5N1GC26O] und drängt seine Filialleiter dazu, die Deutschen und andere Konkurrenten zu unterbieten. Experten zufolge könnte der Riese rund sechs Milliarden Dollar für Maßnahmen springen lassen, um seinen Titel als Discount-Primus zurückzuerobern.

ALDI, LIDL UND AMAZON BRINGEN RIVALEN IN BEDRÄNGNIS

Im Lebensmittelmarkt der USA tobt bereits länger ein Preiskrieg, der seit 2014 schon fast 20 Unternehmen in die Insolvenz getrieben hat. Während Aldis jüngste Offensive den Wettbewerb weiter anheizen dürfte, hält auch der deutsche Erzrivale Lidl in Übersee die Füße nicht still. Die Billig-Kette mit dem blau-gelben Logo will binnen eines Jahres seine ersten 100 US-Geschäfte eröffnen.[nL8N1G06IP] Ebenfalls für Unruhe im Lebensmitteleinzelhandel sorgt Amazon mit der Ausweitung seines Lieferdienstes "Fresh" und dem Testlauf von eigenen Geschäften.

"Wir haben so etwas im Lebensmittelhandel der USA vorher noch nicht erlebt", sagt der auf Preispolitik spezialisierte Analyst Scott Mushkin vom Forschungsinstitut Wolfe Research. Burt Flickinger von der Einzelhandels-Unternehmensberatung Strategic Resource sagt einen gewaltigen Umbruch voraus. Angesichts der Expansion von Aldi, dem Start von Lidl, der Reaktion bei Wal-Mart sowie den wachsenden Amazon-Ambitionen sei in den kommenden Jahren eine deutliche Zunahme von Firmenpleiten zu erwarten. "Aldi stellt die Branche so auf den Kopf, wie Wal-Mart es in seinen Anfängen getan hat", sagt Flickinger.

UPDATE 1-EXCLUSIVE-Aldi raises stakes in U.S. price war with Wal-Mart - 路透新闻

{{20170511T061819.878+0000}}UPDATE 1-EXCLUSIVE-Aldi raises stakes in U.S. price war with Wal-Mart(Adds detail in paragraph 2)

By Nandita Bose

WHEATON, Ill., May 11 (Reuters) - German grocery chain Aldi Inc is trying to beat the world's biggest retailer at its own game: low prices.

Already with 1,600 U.S. stores, Aldi's internal studies show its prices are 21 percent lower than its lowest-priced rivals, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc , according to Chief Executive Jason Hart. He plans to maintain that gap going forward.

His strategy, previously unreported, centers on adding more private-label goods, which are a retailer's in-house brands, to win over price-sensitive customers, and a massive expansion to further disrupt a U.S. grocery sector that has seen 18 companies go bankrupt since 2014.

Hart's plan calls for spending $1.6 billion to expand and remodel 1,300 U.S. stores, and open 400 new stores mainly in Florida, Texas and on both coasts by end of 2018. He also pledged Aldi will be willing to change prices more frequently to respond to rivals if needed.

"We are re-merchandising, remodeling, enhancing our product range and are focused on gaining volume so more customers start their shopping at Aldi and we are able to complete their shopping lists moreso than we have in the past," said Hart, who added Aldi's U.S. sales have doubled in five years.

Though it only accounts for only about 1.5 percent of the U.S. grocery market, Aldi is growing at 15 percent a year, whereas Wal-Mart currently controls about 22 percent of the market and its U.S. sales are estimated to grow about 2 percent this year, according to analysts.

Aldi's growth potential has competitors taking notice. Reuters reported in February that Wal-Mart is running price tests in 11 states, pushing vendors to undercut Aldi and other rivals by 15 percent and is expected to spend about $6 billion to regain its title as the low-price leader.

Price wars are roiling the entire retail sector - from department stores to discount chains - but it is nowhere as intense as in the grocery sector. Beyond Wal-Mart's move to match Aldi on price, German discount chain Lidl plans to open up to a 100 U.S. stores in a year, and Amazon.com Inc is aggressively testing out various brick-and-mortar grocery formats along with growing Amazon Fresh, its grocery delivery service.

"We have not seen anything like this in the grocery sector in the United States before," said Scott Mushkin, managing director of Wolfe Research and a leading pricing analyst.

Such heated competition risks a dangerous race to the bottom that could result in more retailers shutting their doors.

"Given Aldi's expansion, Lidl's entry, Wal-Mart's response and Amazon's growing ambitions in this space, it is fair to expect a significant acceleration in the bankruptcy and liquidation cycle in this sector over the next few years," said Burt Flickinger, managing director at retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group.

GOAL: EVERYDAY LOW PRICING

Aldi, has a simple strategy to win more customers: everyday low pricing, according to Hart.

"We don't confuse our customers with yo-yo discounts, sales, coupons and loyalty cards that require membership fees," he said.

Four analysts and consultants contacted by Reuters confirmed Aldi now offers the lowest prices in private label consumer products in the states it operates, although they did say Wal-Mart is gaining ground in the states they are conducting price tests.

Depending on the product, Aldi's prices are cheaper than most rivals' private label items and even most branded items, analysts said. Hart said the 21 percent difference in price is calculated by monitoring competition on a basket of groceries.

Aldi counts on its no-frills shopping experience to help keep costs low, and limits much of its inventory to items that sell in huge volume. But its focus on offering far more private label items than branded products is central to allowing Aldi to adjust pricing whenever it chooses, Hart said.

Aldi and Wal-Mart do no break out the figures, but analysts including Mushkin and Flickinger say Aldi carries about 1,200 stock keeping units (SKUs) or type of products, 90 percent of which are private label. Wal-Mart stocks about 30,000-40,000 SKU's of products similar to ones Aldi sells, and only 30 percent of that are private labels.

That different product mix can potentially make it more difficult for Wal-Mart to adjust prices because it often first needs buy-in from suppliers, and many times faces push back from packaged goods makers like Procter & Gamble , Unilever and even smaller brands. Such vendors fear steep discounting can erode the value of their brands, analysts said.

A Wal-Mart spokesman declined comment, saying the company would not comment on a competitor's strategy. P&G and Unilever did not respond to Reuters requests seeking comment.

But the explosive growth in private label products is on the radar of Wal-Mart Chief Executive Doug McMillon. Last month he told analysts that private label goods will play an even more important role as the widespread availability of branded products online will compress those products margins over time.

"Aldi is disrupting the sector the way Wal-Mart did when they started," said Strategic Resource Group's Flickinger.

STEPPING UP THE GAME

Aldi's aggressive push to remodel its stores will allow it to add new private label merchandise in rapidly growing categories like fresh food.

"The remodels are aimed at increasing our volumes which means more purchasing power that will help us lower prices further," said Scott Patton, Aldi's vice president of corporate buying.

At a recent visit to an Aldi store in Wheaton, Illinois Reuters found newer-looking shelves, wider aisles and brighter lighting than a typical Aldi store. There was also a bigger assortment of fresh, organic, gluten-free products and antibiotic-free meats versus what it stocked earlier - categories Aldi said is growing the most rapidly at its stores.

For example, its Simply Nature range of private-label products grew 53 percent to $300 million in 2016 from a year ago.

Aldi has also opened stores close to Wal-Mart's supercenters to benefit from its budget-conscious shoppers. Its total store count of 2,000 stores by the end of next year will be about 42 percent of Wal-Mart's U.S. store base.

ENTREVISTA-DHL dice nuevo servicio en Chile está "en auge" y resuelve problemas de entrega - 路透新闻

{{20170510T170535.101+0000}}ENTREVISTA-DHL dice nuevo servicio en Chile está "en auge" y resuelve problemas de entregaPor Rosalba O'Brien

SANTIAGO, 10 mayo (Reuters) - La entrada de DHL eCommerce en Sudamérica a través de Chile, hace poco más de un mes, ha superado las expectativas al permitir a los comercios nuevas opciones de entrega que podrían impulsar las ventas en línea, dijo un ejecutivo regional.

El comercio electrónico todavía está en pañales en América Latina, retrasado por mala infraestructura, temores de los consumidores al fraude y la falta de opciones de pago.

Chile, uno de los mercados más desarrollados de la región, tiene un elevado uso de tarjetas de crédito y carreteras de buena calidad, pero la industria de encomiendas existente está dirigida principalmente a empresas y es poco agradable a los consumidores.

Un giro en esa dinámica podría cambiar el juego y DHL [DHL.UL] desea estar desde el inicio, dijo Paul Tessy, director ejecutivo de DHL eCommerce para Latinoamérica y Canadá.

"Nuestra solución en Chile es innovadora frente a lo que ofrece la competencia (...) el negocio está en auge porque no hay nada como eso por ahí", dijo en una entrevista reciente con Reuters.

DHL está introduciendo soluciones enfocadas en el consumidor que pueden no parecer revolucionarias en mercados más maduros, pero que representan un cambio radical en Chile.

Eso incluye la opción para entregas nocturnas y de fin de semana, una aplicación que permite a los clientes ver dónde está su entrega en tiempo real, cargos más bajos por paquetes ligeros y la opción para que las devoluciones se recojan en los hogares.

Más de 50 "pequeños y medianos" transportistas se inscribieron en el primer mes y la compañía está en conversaciones con algunos de los jugadores más grandes.

"La gente va a comprar más y los comerciantes venden más porque la gente no tiene miedo de perder el tiempo", dijo el ejecutivo.

Tessy dijo que Chile es un "modelo" y que DHL evalúa activamente otros mercados, destacando Brasil, Argentina y Colombia.

Los minoristas como Falabella , Ripley y Wal-Mart ya operan negocios de comercio electrónico en Chile.

"Esperamos que actores globales como Amazon aumenten su exposición al mercado latinoamericano, en especial si DHL replica su oferta fuera de Chile", señalaron analistas de BMI Research.

Amazon.com actualmente opera en Brasil y México, pero no tiene presencia en ninguna otra parte de América Latina.

Se espera que el comercio electrónico en la región crezca alrededor del 14 por ciento anual hasta el 2020, prevé BMI.

Según cifras de la Cámara de Comercio de Santiago, las ventas electrónicas representan el 4 por ciento del total de las minoristas.

RPT-INSIGHT-Amazon trounces rivals in battle of the shopping 'bots' - 路透新闻

{{20170510T110007.069+0000}}RPT-INSIGHT-Amazon trounces rivals in battle of the shopping 'bots'(Repeating for additional clients without changes to text)

By Jeffrey Dastin

SAN FRANCISCO, May 10 (Reuters) - Earlier this year,
engineers at Wal-Mart Stores Inc  who track rivals'
prices online got a rude surprise: the technology they were
using to check Amazon.com several million times a day suddenly
stopped working.

Losing access to Amazon.com Inc's  data was no small
matter. Like most big retailers, Wal-Mart relies on computer
programs that scan prices on competitors' websites so it can
adjust its listings accordingly. A difference of even 50 cents
can mean losing a sale.

But a new tactic by Amazon to block these programs - known
commonly as robots or bots - thwarted the Bentonville,
Arkansas-based retailer.

Its technology unit, @WalmartLabs, was unable to work around
the blockade for weeks, forcing it to retrieve Amazon's data
through a secondary source, according to a person familiar with
the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly.

The previously unreported incident offers a case study in
how Amazon's technological prowess is helping it dominate the
retail competition.

Now the largest online retailer in the world, Amazon is best
known by consumers for its fast delivery, huge product catalog
and ambitious moves into areas like original TV programming. But
its mastery of the complex, behind-the-scenes technologies that
power modern e-commerce is just as important to its success.

Dexterity with bots allows Amazon not only to see what its
rivals are doing, but increasingly to keep them in the dark when
it undercuts them on price or is quietly charging more.

"Benchmarking against Amazon is going to become hard," said
Guru Hariharan, a former Amazon manager who now sells pricing
software to retailers as chief executive of Mountain View,
California-based Boomerang Commerce.

A Wal-Mart spokesman declined to discuss the January episode
but said the company improves its technology regularly and has
multiple tools for tracking items. He said the company offers
value not only through pricing but from discounts for in-store
pickup and other benefits.

A spokeswoman for Amazon said the company is aware of
competitors using bots to check its listings and denied any
"campaign" to stop them. "Nothing has changed recently in how we
manage bots on our site," she said. Still, she said, "we
prioritize humans over bots as needed."

Bots can slow down a website, a big motivator for retailers
to block them.

Reuters interviewed 21 people familiar with bots and how
they are deployed, including current and former Wal-Mart
employees, former Amazon employees and outside specialists. Many
spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not
authorized to discuss the issues publicly.

Most pointed to Amazon's leadership in the burgeoning bot
wars. [For graphic - click http://tmsnrt.rs/2qXbYfT
]

The company's technological edge has been good for its
profit margin, and it's proving a winning formula for investors.
Shares of the internet powerhouse have risen about 15-fold since
the market's bottom in March 2009, while the S&P 500 has more
than tripled in value. Amazon hit $100 billion in annual sales
in 2015 - faster than any company in history, it said.

BRAVE NEW WORLD

Bot-driven pricing has represented a massive change for the
retail industry since Amazon helped pioneer the practice more
than a decade ago.

Traditionally, brick-and-mortar stores changed prices no
more than weekly because of the time and expense needed to swap
labels by hand.

In the world of e-commerce, though, retailers update prices
with ease, sometimes multiple times a day, helped by algorithms
that consider inventory levels, sales forecasts and rivals'
pricing data.

To stay in the game, companies such as online wholesaler
Boxed, based in New York, depend on a variety of methods
including bots to ensure they do not lag others' price moves for
even 20 minutes.

"That's like a lifetime during Christmas," said Chief
Executive Chieh Huang, whose company sells bulk staples like
toilet paper and pet food. "If we're not decently priced, we'll
see it almost immediately" in sales declines.

DISGUISED AS HUMANS

Using bots to view massive amounts of data on public
websites - a process known as crawling or scraping - has many
purposes. Alphabet Inc's  Google, for example,
constantly crawls the Web to gather information for its search
engine results and to sell ads.

In e-commerce, though, the use of bots has developed into a
cat-and-mouse game. Companies try to thwart the practice on
their own websites while aiming to penetrate their competitors'
defenses. Third-party services abound to help less-savvy
retailers. [For diagram - click http://tmsnrt.rs/2qX4DwB
]

To protect data from rivals, some retail websites use what's
known as a "CAPTCHA" - typically a distorted string of letters
and numbers that humans can read but most bots can't. Amazon
shies away from the practice because it annoys some customers.

For merchants seeking to evade such defenses, disguising
their computer programs as real shoppers is key. Some pricing
technology experts have programmed computer cursors to meander
through a Web page in the way a person might, instead of going
directly to the prized data. Another technique is to use
multiple computer addresses so that retailers cannot track a
barrage of clicks to a single source.

"It is an arms race," said Keith Anderson, a senior vice
president at e-commerce analytics firm Profitero, based in
Ireland. "Every week or every month, there's some new approach
from both sides."

Amazon's maneuver that halted Wal-Mart in January took aim
at a specialized Web browser called PhantomJS. Unlike, say,
Internet Explorer, this browser is designed specifically for
programmers - a telltale clue that its users are not typical
shoppers. Amazon put up a digital curtain to hide its listings
from PhantomJS users, according to three people familiar with
the situation.

It was unclear how the move, which was not aimed at Wal-Mart
in particular, affected other companies.

Tests conducted in recent weeks for Reuters show that among
major U.S. retail chains, Amazon had by far the most
sophisticated bot detection in place, both for its home page and
for two popular items selected by Reuters because they change
price frequently - a De'Longhi coffee maker and a Logitech
webcam.

The tests were run by San Francisco-based Distil Networks,
which sells anti-bot tools. In one of the tests, Distil
programmed bots to hit each retailer's website 3,000 times, but
slowly enough to mimic a person clicking through listings. This
tricked most retail behemoths, but not Amazon.

Blocked bots would not have seen, for instance, that
Amazon's price for the De'Longhi espresso machine changed four
times in a single 24-hour period starting on the morning of
April 25, according to price tracking website
camelcamelcamel.com. During that time, the price swung by more
than 10 percent, from a low of $80.06 to $88.16.

SWARMING WITH BOTS

Despite Amazon's capabilities, the sheer volume of crawling
on its site is staggering. At times, as many as 80 percent of
the clicks on Amazon product listings have been from bots,
people familiar with the matter say, compared with just a third
or more of the traffic on other large sites.

In addition to rivals seeking price data, that traffic
includes bots from university researchers studying competition,
search engines, advertising services and even fraudsters trying
to break into Amazon accounts.

For Wal-Mart, a small group in Silicon Valley directs its
automated pricing strategy while dozens of engineers in India
and around the world handle the code, current and former
Wal-Mart employees said.

Amazon had about 40 engineers who would covertly extract and
organize rivals' data with bots as of several years ago, one of
the people interviewed said. Amazon did not discuss the size or
structure of its teams working with bots.

According to one U.S. patent application, Amazon is working
on encryption technology that would force bots, but not humans,
to solve a complicated algorithm to gain access to its Web
pages. [For full patent record - click http://tmsnrt.rs/2qXbYwp
]

"Amazon has both the competency to detect bot traffic and
the wherewithal to do something about it," said Scott Jacobson,
a former Amazon manager and now managing director of Madrona
Venture Group. That "isn't the case for most retailers."

INSIGHT-Amazon trounces rivals in battle of the shopping 'bots' - 路透新闻

{{20170510T051238.593+0000}}INSIGHT-Amazon trounces rivals in battle of the shopping 'bots'By Jeffrey Dastin

SAN FRANCISCO, May 10 (Reuters) - Earlier this year,
engineers at Wal-Mart Stores Inc  who track rivals'
prices online got a rude surprise: the technology they were
using to check Amazon.com several million times a day suddenly
stopped working.

Losing access to Amazon.com Inc's  data was no small
matter. Like most big retailers, Wal-Mart relies on computer
programs that scan prices on competitors' websites so it can
adjust its listings accordingly. A difference of even 50 cents
can mean losing a sale.

But a new tactic by Amazon to block these programs - known
commonly as robots or bots - thwarted the Bentonville,
Arkansas-based retailer.

Its technology unit, @WalmartLabs, was unable to work around
the blockade for weeks, forcing it to retrieve Amazon's data
through a secondary source, according to a person familiar with
the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly.

The previously unreported incident offers a case study in
how Amazon's technological prowess is helping it dominate the
retail competition.

Now the largest online retailer in the world, Amazon is best
known by consumers for its fast delivery, huge product catalog
and ambitious moves into areas like original TV programming. But
its mastery of the complex, behind-the-scenes technologies that
power modern e-commerce is just as important to its success.

Dexterity with bots allows Amazon not only to see what its
rivals are doing, but increasingly to keep them in the dark when
it undercuts them on price or is quietly charging more.

"Benchmarking against Amazon is going to become hard," said
Guru Hariharan, a former Amazon manager who now sells pricing
software to retailers as chief executive of Mountain View,
California-based Boomerang Commerce.

A Wal-Mart spokesman declined to discuss the January episode
but said the company improves its technology regularly and has
multiple tools for tracking items. He said the company offers
value not only through pricing but from discounts for in-store
pickup and other benefits.

A spokeswoman for Amazon said the company is aware of
competitors using bots to check its listings and denied any
"campaign" to stop them. "Nothing has changed recently in how we
manage bots on our site," she said. Still, she said, "we
prioritize humans over bots as needed."

Bots can slow down a website, a big motivator for retailers
to block them.

Reuters interviewed 21 people familiar with bots and how
they are deployed, including current and former Wal-Mart
employees, former Amazon employees and outside specialists. Many
spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not
authorized to discuss the issues publicly.

Most pointed to Amazon's leadership in the burgeoning bot
wars. [For graphic - click http://tmsnrt.rs/2qXbYfT
]

The company's technological edge has been good for its
profit margin, and it's proving a winning formula for investors.
Shares of the internet powerhouse have risen about 15-fold since
the market's bottom in March 2009, while the S&P 500 has more
than tripled in value. Amazon hit $100 billion in annual sales
in 2015 - faster than any company in history, it said.

BRAVE NEW WORLD

Bot-driven pricing has represented a massive change for the
retail industry since Amazon helped pioneer the practice more
than a decade ago.

Traditionally, brick-and-mortar stores changed prices no
more than weekly because of the time and expense needed to swap
labels by hand.

In the world of e-commerce, though, retailers update prices
with ease, sometimes multiple times a day, helped by algorithms
that consider inventory levels, sales forecasts and rivals'
pricing data.

To stay in the game, companies such as online wholesaler
Boxed, based in New York, depend on a variety of methods
including bots to ensure they do not lag others' price moves for
even 20 minutes.

"That's like a lifetime during Christmas," said Chief
Executive Chieh Huang, whose company sells bulk staples like
toilet paper and pet food. "If we're not decently priced, we'll
see it almost immediately" in sales declines.

DISGUISED AS HUMANS

Using bots to view massive amounts of data on public
websites - a process known as crawling or scraping - has many
purposes. Alphabet Inc's  Google, for example,
constantly crawls the Web to gather information for its search
engine results and to sell ads.

In e-commerce, though, the use of bots has developed into a
cat-and-mouse game. Companies try to thwart the practice on
their own websites while aiming to penetrate their competitors'
defenses. Third-party services abound to help less-savvy
retailers. [For diagram - click http://tmsnrt.rs/2qX4DwB
]

To protect data from rivals, some retail websites use what's
known as a "CAPTCHA" - typically a distorted string of letters
and numbers that humans can read but most bots can't. Amazon
shies away from the practice because it annoys some customers.

For merchants seeking to evade such defenses, disguising
their computer programs as real shoppers is key. Some pricing
technology experts have programmed computer cursors to meander
through a Web page in the way a person might, instead of going
directly to the prized data. Another technique is to use
multiple computer addresses so that retailers cannot track a
barrage of clicks to a single source.

"It is an arms race," said Keith Anderson, a senior vice
president at e-commerce analytics firm Profitero, based in
Ireland. "Every week or every month, there's some new approach
from both sides."

Amazon's maneuver that halted Wal-Mart in January took aim
at a specialized Web browser called PhantomJS. Unlike, say,
Internet Explorer, this browser is designed specifically for
programmers - a telltale clue that its users are not typical
shoppers. Amazon put up a digital curtain to hide its listings
from PhantomJS users, according to three people familiar with
the situation.

It was unclear how the move, which was not aimed at Wal-Mart
in particular, affected other companies.

Tests conducted in recent weeks for Reuters show that among
major U.S. retail chains, Amazon had by far the most
sophisticated bot detection in place, both for its home page and
for two popular items selected by Reuters because they change
price frequently - a De'Longhi coffee maker and a Logitech
webcam.

The tests were run by San Francisco-based Distil Networks,
which sells anti-bot tools. In one of the tests, Distil
programmed bots to hit each retailer's website 3,000 times, but
slowly enough to mimic a person clicking through listings. This
tricked most retail behemoths, but not Amazon.

Blocked bots would not have seen, for instance, that
Amazon's price for the De'Longhi espresso machine changed four
times in a single 24-hour period starting on the morning of
April 25, according to price tracking website
camelcamelcamel.com. During that time, the price swung by more
than 10 percent, from a low of $80.06 to $88.16.

SWARMING WITH BOTS

Despite Amazon's capabilities, the sheer volume of crawling
on its site is staggering. At times, as many as 80 percent of
the clicks on Amazon product listings have been from bots,
people familiar with the matter say, compared with just a third
or more of the traffic on other large sites.

In addition to rivals seeking price data, that traffic
includes bots from university researchers studying competition,
search engines, advertising services and even fraudsters trying
to break into Amazon accounts.

For Wal-Mart, a small group in Silicon Valley directs its
automated pricing strategy while dozens of engineers in India
and around the world handle the code, current and former
Wal-Mart employees said.

Amazon had about 40 engineers who would covertly extract and
organize rivals' data with bots as of several years ago, one of
the people interviewed said. Amazon did not discuss the size or
structure of its teams working with bots.

According to one U.S. patent application, Amazon is working
on encryption technology that would force bots, but not humans,
to solve a complicated algorithm to gain access to its Web
pages. [For full patent record - click http://tmsnrt.rs/2qXbYwp
]

"Amazon has both the competency to detect bot traffic and
the wherewithal to do something about it," said Scott Jacobson,
a former Amazon manager and now managing director of Madrona
Venture Group. That "isn't the case for most retailers."

Wal-Mart close to settlement with U.S. over alleged bribery -report - 路透新闻

{{20170509T205635.141+0000}}Wal-Mart close to settlement with U.S. over alleged bribery -reportCHICAGO, May 9 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc is preparing to pay about $300 million to settle a probe of bribery by its employees in markets including Mexico, India and China, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The deal, which would mark a significant concession by the U.S. government, was being finalized and could change, the Bloomberg report said. In October 2016, Wal-Mart rebuffed a proposal by U.S. prosecutors to pay at least $600 million to settle the same corruption probe. [nL4N1I518Z] Wal-Mart spokesman Greg Hitt declined to comment on the story. Last week , Wal-Mart told Reuters it was considering getting certified under a new international program that could help companies defend themselves against isolated cases of corruption or poor business practices. [nL4N1I518Z]

The proposed resolution would require a guilty plea by at least one Wal-Mart subsidiary, but the parent company would not be charged, the report said.

The U.S. Department of Justice has been conducting a long-running investigation into potential misconduct by Wal-Mart in some overseas markets, including China, Brazil, India and Mexico.

Wal-Mart's ethics and compliance system came into focus after the New York Times reported in 2012 that Wal-Mart had engaged in a multi-year bribery campaign to build its Wal-Mart de Mexico business.

So far Wal-Mart has spent more than $800 million on legal fees and an internal investigation into the alleged payments and to revamp its compliance systems around the world.

Amazon cuts free shipping minimum to $25 - 路透新闻

{{20170509T181849.521+0000}}Amazon cuts free shipping minimum to $25May 9 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said on Tuesday it cut the threshold for free shipping to $25 from $35, upping the ante against Wal-Mart Stores Inc in a hotly contested battle for ecommerce supremacy.

Amazon already offers free two-day shipping under its $99 Prime membership program but the new offer is aimed at encouraging more customers to shop on its platform.

Amazon also hopes to convert these shoppers to Prime members down the line.

The world's biggest retailer, Wal-Mart, has been building up its ecommerce business through acquisitions such as Jet.com, as it looks to narrow the massive gap with Amazon.

Wal-Mart started its own membership program called ShippingPass last year, which offered free two-day shipping for $49 a year. However, the company ended the program in January, replacing it with free two-day shipping on orders of $35 or more.

ACTUALIZA 1-Ventas iguales de Walmex crecen a su mayor ritmo en seis meses - 路透新闻

{{20170508T210003.854+0000}}ACTUALIZA 1-Ventas iguales de Walmex crecen a su mayor ritmo en seis meses(Actualiza con datos del comunicado)

CIUDAD DE MÉXICO, 8 mayo (Reuters) - El gigante minorista Wal-Mart de México (Walmex) reportó el lunes un incremento de 10.2 por ciento en sus ventas comparables de abril, el mayor ritmo de crecimiento en seis meses.

El avance es el mayor desde octubre de 2016, cuando reportó un incremento de 10.8 por ciento.

Analistas habían dicho que las ventas comparables de Wal-Mart se verían favorecidas en el cuarto mes del año por el periodo de vacaciones de Semana Santa, que este año ocurrió en abril en vez de marzo.

Walmex , la mayor cadena minorista del país, informó que las ventas totales crecieron un 13.6 por ciento, impulsadas por crecimientos de 22.7 por ciento en Centroamérica y de 11.6 en México.

Walmex define las ventas iguales o comparables como aquellas que generan las tiendas con más de un año en operación.

BREAKINGVIEWS-M&S opts for safety over real shakeup - 路透新闻

{{20170505T105719.532+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-M&S opts for safety over real shakeup(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Carol Ryan

LONDON, May 5 (Reuters Breakingviews) - It may not just be the clothing designs that need more imagination at Marks & Spencer . The British high street retailer named Archie Norman as its new chairman, days after hiring a new boss for its troubled fashion unit. His retail nous will bolster M&S' turnaround plans. Yet the appointment is the latest in a series of safe choices that underestimate the changes sweeping retail.

News of the new addition to the M&S board sent the company's stock up 5 percent on Friday morning, giving it a market capitalisation of 6.1 billion pounds ($7.9 billion). Norman has a flair for business turnarounds, including a successful eight-year stint as chief executive of supermarket Asda that brought it back from the financial brink and culminated in a 6.7 billion pound sale to U.S. mega-retailer Wal-Mart in 1999. He has held chairman roles at broadcaster ITV , Lazard London and arts supplier Hobbycraft.

That makes him a valuable sounding-board for Chief Executive Steve Rowe, who is trying to overhaul M&S. A stint as a conservative parliamentarian might help Norman read Brexit's political runes. And the announcement on May 3 that former Halfords Chief Executive Jill McDonald will head up the troubled clothing and homewares business frees up Rowe to tackle fundamental problems such as reducing fixed costs, possibly with further store closures.

Yet M&S remains conservative. Rowe has been with the company since 1989. When Norman made his name in retail he didn't have to worry about online or foreign competition from the likes of Zara, Amazon or German discounters. M&S' cautious approach to online food delivery already threatens to leave it locked out of an online grocery market that will be worth almost 18 billion pounds by 2021 – 9 percent of total sales – according to IGD forecasts. In hiring Norman, M&S gets itself a skilled and safe pair of hands. It still looks short on vision at a time when retail is being upended.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Marks and Spencer on May 5 announced that it has appointed Archie Norman as the group's new chairman, replacing Robert Swannell who will retire on Sept. 1.

- Norman was previously chairman of ITV, Lazard London and Hobbycraft and was formerly the chief executive of grocer Asda.

- The company's shares were up 5.4 percent to 377 pence by 1005 BST on May 5.

Wal-Mart files patent for Amazon Dash rival - 路透新闻

{{20170504T202155.891+0000}}Wal-Mart files patent for Amazon Dash rivalMay 4 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc has applied for a patent to compete with Amazon.com Inc's wifi-connected, one-button ordering device, Amazon Dash, according to data provider CB Insights.

The patent, filed in October, would be the first of Wal-Mart's more than 800 patents and applications to focus on Internet of Things (IoT) and branches into shoppers' homes, CB Insights said.

Wal-Mart's system would require less effort than Amazon's, a CB Insights blog post said.

"While Dash buttons still require users to press a physical button separate from the product, Wal-Mart aims to integrate IoT into the products themselves for automatic re-ordering with no user input at all," the blog post said.

Wal-Mart seeks anti-corruption certification, in talks with regulators  - 路透新闻

{{20170503T225500.520+0000}}Wal-Mart seeks anti-corruption certification, in talks with regulators By Kevin Krolicki and Nandita Bose

NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Wednesday it was considering getting certified under a new international program that could help companies defend themselves against isolated cases of corruption or poor business practices.

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed the so-called anti-corruption compliance program and Wal-Mart is hoping to be the first U.S. company to get certified under it, said Jay Jorgensen, Wal-Mart's executive vice president and global chief ethics and compliance officer.

"We have begun looking for a company that would certify us," Jorgensen told the Thomson Reuters Financial and Risk Summit in New York.

The ISO is the world's largest developer and publisher of international standards.

Jorgensen added that Wal-Mart was interested in seeing the program develop in the United States, with the government laying out its own anti-corruption compliance framework or adopting ISO standards to help protect companies that follow it and defend themselves if something goes wrong.

Jorgensen also shared a recent development in which federal agencies have contacted the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer about compliance programs.

"Over the past couple of months ... some of the federal agencies have reached out to say 'hey do you have any feedback for us, anything we are doing is unreasonable?,'" Jorgensen said.

Wal-Mart has given feedback to federal agencies and will continue doing so and the company would also be open to speaking with state regulators about compliance, he said.

Jorgensen cited an example of how a broken baby shampoo bottle in California is treated as hazardous waste that retailers have to dispose off through an incinerator.

"We would love it if California would say 'hey we would like some feedback," Jorgensen said.

Jorgensen, who joined Wal-Mart in 2012, has been instrumental in revamping Wal-Mart's compliance systems around the world and building a dedicated ethics and compliance team. That team has a staff of over 2,300, including over 500 in the United States and over 1,800 in international markets.

Since 2013, Wal-Mart has invested more than $141 million in global ethics and compliance systems, Jorgensen said.

More recently, Wal-Mart has created licensing teams that monitor the more than 56,000 licenses and permits Wal-Mart needs to operate in global markets using a centralized licensing system that reduces the error of wrongdoing and increases transparency, he said.

For the last four years, the Wal-Mart board's compensation committee has conditioned a portion of its most senior executives' compensation on making adequate progress toward annual compliance goals. In its latest compliance report, Wal-Mart said it has achieved over 200 of these board-level objectives, including over 60 that relate specifically to its anti-corruption program.

Wal-Mart's ethics and compliance system came into focus after a New York Times report in 2012 found Wal-Mart had engaged in a multi-year bribery campaign to build its Wal-Mart de Mexico business.

This was followed by an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into potential misconduct by Wal-Mart, including violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in some overseas markets including China, Brazil, India and Mexico. In October, Wal-Mart rebuffed a proposal by U.S. prosecutors to pay at least $600 million to settle a corruption probe into the company's practices in markets including Mexico, India and China.

So far Wal-Mart has spent about $800 million on legal fees and an internal investigation into the alleged payments and to revamp its compliance systems around the world.

UPDATE 2-Sainsbury's warns challenging UK market means long wait for profit growth - 路透新闻

{{20170503T104747.112+0000}}UPDATE 2-Sainsbury's warns challenging UK market means long wait for profit growth* Sainsbury's posts third straight fall in annual profit

* Shares in Sainsbury's fall 5 percent after results

* To speed up plan to open 250 Argos Digital stores

* Pretax profit 581 million pounds in year to March 11

(Adds CEO, analyst comment, shares)

By James Davey

LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - British supermarket Sainsbury's warned a challenging market meant it could take up to five years to deliver sustainable profit growth, despite a robust performance from general retailer Argos which it bought last year.

Sainsbury's, which trails market leader Tesco in annual sales, reported a third straight fall in annual profit on Wednesday, hurt by price cuts and cost inflation, and confirmed analysts' forecasts for another decline in 2017-18.

Last year Sainsbury's expanded in areas such as electrical goods when it bought Argos-owner Home Retail for 1.1 billion pounds ($1.42 billion), which it said has gone well so far.

"Our job is to build a business for the future," said Chief Executive Mike Coupe, who outlined his strategy for the business two and a half years ago.

Shares in Sainsbury's were down 5 percent at 265.5 pence at 1034 GMT, valuing the business at 5.8 billion pounds and taking the year on year decline to nearly 7 percent.

"The UK grocery industry is one of the most challenging, if not the most challenging, in the world ... (but) we think over a three to five year period we can deliver strong and steady profit growth," he told reporters.

Sainsbury's said Argos contributed a better than expected profit of 77 million pounds in the second half and would deliver a 160 million pounds boost to earnings six months early. It also said it would speed up a plan to open 250 Argos Digital stores in its supermarkets.

Sainsbury's made an underlying pretax profit of 581 million pounds in the year to March 11, down from 587 million pounds made the year before. The average forecast by analysts was 578 million pounds.

The result reflected intense price competition, driven by German discounters Aldi and Lidl, as well as cost inflation, offset by cost savings of 130 million pounds and the contribution from Argos.

Group sales rose 12.7 percent to 29.1 billion pounds, but Sainsbury's' own like-for-like sales fell 0.6 percent. [nL5N1GT18G]

"Unlike its domestic rivals Tesco and Morrisons , like-for-like sales at Sainsbury' have remained stubbornly negative recently. Lower prices, weaker margins and a falling market share. Not a good combination," said George Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

Morrisons and Tesco are both in turnaround mode after going through disastrous periods while Sainsbury's market share has remained broadly stable over the last five years.

Some analysts believe Sainsbury's is vulnerable to further price cuts by Tesco and a recovering Asda and the supermarket's Chief Financial Officer Kevin O'Byrne said he was comfortable with an average profit forecast of 573 million pounds for 2017-18, meaning a drop for yet another year.

Some analysts also say Argos increases Sainsbury's exposure to the threat of Amazon [AMZN.O] and to higher import costs at a time when pressure on discretionary purchases is building as inflation grows and wage growth is muted. ($1 = 0.7736 pounds)

UPDATE 1-British grocery sales jump on higher inflation and Easter - 路透新闻

{{20170503T100536.614+0000}}UPDATE 1-British grocery sales jump on higher inflation and Easter(Adds table)

LONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - Britain's grocery market grew by
3.7 percent in the 12 weeks to April 23, the fastest rate since
September 2013, driven by Britons splashing out on food at
Easter and inflation edging higher, industry data showed on
Wednesday.

Market researcher Kantar Worldpanel said all 10 major
retailers were in growth for the first time in three-and-a-half
years. Grocery prices jumped 2.6 percent year-on-year in the
period, up from the 2.3 percent recorded in the 12 weeks to
March 26.

Market leader Tesco  posted growth of 1.9 percent
while Sainsbury's  grew by 1.7 percent, Asda grew by 0.8
percent and Morrisons  grew by 2.2 percent. Asda's growth
marked the first year-on-year sales rise since October 2014.

The results were boosted by the timing of Easter, which fell
later than normal this year.

{{20170503T071650.437+0000}}British grocery sales jump on higher inflation and EasterLONDON, May 3 (Reuters) - Britain's grocery market grew by 3.7 percent in the 12 weeks to April 23, the fastest rate since September 2013, driven by Britons splashing out on food at Easter and inflation edging higher, industry data showed on Wednesday.

Market researcher Kantar Worldpanel said all 10 major retailers were in growth for the first time in three-and-a-half years. Grocery prices jumped 2.6 percent year-on-year in the period, up from the 2.3 percent recorded in the 12 weeks to March 26.

Market leader Tesco posted growth of 1.9 percent while Sainsbury's grew by 1.7 percent, Asda grew by 0.8 percent and Morrisons grew by 2.2 percent. Asda's growth marked the first year-on-year sales rise since October 2014.

The results were boosted by the timing of Easter, which fell later than normal this year.
