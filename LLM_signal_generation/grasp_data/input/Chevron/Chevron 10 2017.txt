Chevron drops decision to leave Bangladesh - Reuters News

{{20171029T125045.798+0000}}Chevron drops decision to leave BangladeshDHAKA, Oct 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. oil company Chevron will not sell three subsidiaries and leave Bangladesh as planned, Chevron said on Sunday.

Chevron had said in April it would sell to China's Himalaya Energy Co. the wholly owned subsidiaries that operate three gas fields, which together account for 58 percent of Bangladesh's gas production.

Chevron "will not be proceeding with an agreement to sell the shares of its wholly owned indirect subsidiaries," Cameron Van Ast, Chevron's external affairs advisor for Asia and the Pacific, said in a statement sent to Reuters on Sunday.

"Chevron has decided to retain these assets and will continue to work with our partners Petrobangla and the government of Bangladesh to provide reliable and affordable energy to the nation," the statement said.

Chevron did not give a reason for reversing its decision.

Rather than leaving, Chevron will invest $400 million at Bibiyana, the country's largest gas field, said Nasrul Hamid, Bangladesh's junior minister for power, energy and mineral resources. Bibiyana produces 1,250 million cubic feet of gas a day.

Chevron formally conveyed its intention to stay in Bangladesh in a letter last week, Hamid said.

WRAPUP 2-Exxon, Chevron results linked to oil price, not cost cuts  - Reuters News

{{20171027T182422.160+0000}}WRAPUP 2-Exxon, Chevron results linked to oil price, not cost cuts (Adds earnings call info, updates stock movements)

By Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Rising oil and natural gas prices boosted third-quarter profits at Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp by about 50 percent, underscoring how reliant they remain on commodity markets for their financial futures than better technology or cost cuts.

Despite deep capital spending cuts and a refocusing on projects that can generate faster paybacks in recent years, the results on Friday showed the pair, neither of whom hedge oil output, are still at the mercy of price gyrations.

Exxon and Chevron have pointed to aggressive plans for boosting low-cost U.S. shale production. But in recent quarters total output at both has atrophied and shale is unlikely to deliver a marked lift until the next decade, based on corporate projections.

"Both are trying to be disciplined and show growth," said Brian Youngberg, an oil industry analyst with Edward Jones. "But it's a little bit of a transition, especially as they're trying to increase shale (output)."

The pair reported the same day as French rival Total SA posted a 29 percent jump in its third-quarter net profit as project ramp-ups and new investments lifted production. [nL8N1N21J2]

Exxon, which reported a better-than-expected quarterly, said its Permian oil production will grow 45 percent each year through 2020, to more than 400,000 barrels per day. The company also has a large shale position in North Dakota's Bakken shale formation. [nL2N1N20K7]

Still, Exxon said higher prices contributed $860 million to its earnings while volume increases added only $20 million to the latest quarter's exploration profit. Exxon's total output in the quarter was the lowest this year.

Also on Friday Exxon, part of a consortium with Norway's Statoil and Portugal's Petrogal, a unit of Galp Energia , won one of four blocks in Brazil's coveted pre-salt oil region in an auction. [nL2N1N20CJ]

Exxon stock edged up 0.1 percent to $83.53 on Friday afternoon.

At Chevron, a writedown of its Bangladesh operations and a drop in U.S. production weighed on results, which missed Wall Street estimates by a wide margin. [nL2N1N20NT]

Chevron's stock slid 4.5 percent to $113.15, a drop that surprised Chief Executive Officer John Watson, he said during an investors conference call.

The San Ramon, California, company, which has been one of the Permian's largest acreage holders since the 1930s, has only recently begun to aggressively develop its oil reserves there. Watson told Reuters earlier this year the Permian is "very important" in the company's portfolio. [nL2N1HC1IA]

While the company has yet to forecast 2018 production goals for the Permian, Watson said on Friday that Chevron will grow aggressively in the region.

Chevron's overall average daily output was up 8 percent over a year ago, but that was largely due to the start of giant natural-gas projects. U.S. oil production at Chevron fell overall, as aging field output offset a jump in Permian production.

The loss in U.S. oil production narrowed sharply as the price received for its crude rose 13.5 percent over a year earlier.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Big Oil's well-plugged holes do their job, for now - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20171027T172018.961+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Big Oil's well-plugged holes do their job, for now(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Lauren Silva Laughlin

DALLAS, Oct 27 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Big Oil's well-plugged holes are starting to do their job, at least for now. Exxon , Chevron and Conoco all posted decent earnings for the third quarter on Friday. And they're ramping up production – even Conoco, despite cutting capital expenditures. That's proof their endeavors to adapt to $50-a-barrel oil are paying off.

Rising prices helped: Exxon sold oil at roughly $6.50 a barrel more than the same quarter last year. But it is also expanding in the profitable West Texas Permian basin, in part through acquisitions. It now has 20 rigs in the region and plans to add another 10 in the next year. And it purchased deep-water assets in Brazil on Friday, adding to some it bought last month.

Chevron keeps flexing its muscles in Texas, which helped contribute to a big boost to profit over the past nine months. Outgoing Chief Executive John Watson expects production to rise as much as 8 percent worldwide, excluding asset sales. Two flagship liquefied natural gas projects in Australia are finally online after years of development, too.

Companies are cautious about the future, however. Exxon seems wary about doing a big deal in Texas unless the company can find enough synergies to justify the price. ConocoPhillips, which reported earnings on Thursday, is cutting spending by a tenth. Chevron's Watson reckons costs next year should stay under control as investments in short-cycle shale projects are already well funded. He appears to be more focused on cash flow than big growth plans.

Longer term, though, oil companies face a dilemma between increasing drilling and making money. Exxon illustrates this well. The company is planning a near-fourfold increase in U.S. production by 2025. Some of that may come from acquiring drillers that already produce oil. But Exxon also has plenty of untapped land to develop, which will add more oil to the market.

It has some 5,500 wells in the Permian and Bakken generating at least a 10 percent rate of return with oil at $40 a barrel. A third make over 30 percent. That's fine for Exxon. But the more oil it drills, the more the extra supply is likely to keep a lid on the price of black gold – and keep industry profit under pressure.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Exxon Mobil on Oct. 27 reported third-quarter net income of $3.97 billion, compared with $2.7 billion in the same period last year. At 93 cents a share, earnings beat the consensus estimate of sell-side analysts of 86 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The impact of Hurricane Harvey reduced earnings by 4 cents a share.

- Exxon's production rose 2 percent to 3.9 million barrels of oil equivalent a day.

- On the same day, Chevron reported third-quarter net income of $1.95 billion, or $1.03 per share, compared with $1.28 billion in the three months to the end of September last year. Earnings were $1.03 a share, but fell to 85 cents a share after excluding one-off items. The consensus estimate of sell-side analysts was for 98 cents a share.

- Production rose 8 percent to 2.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.

- ConocoPhillips said on Oct. 26 that it planned to exceed its original oil-production estimate despite cutting its capital budget by 10 percent. The largest independent oil producer reported better-than-expected profit of 34 cents a share compared to a loss of 84 cents a share a year ago. Excluding one-time items, Conoco earned 16 cents a share. By that measure, analysts expected earnings of 8 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

UPDATE 1-Big Oil's $1 bln climate fund picks investments, eyes new members - Reuters News

{{20171027T144434.479+0000}}UPDATE 1-Big Oil's $1 bln climate fund picks investments, eyes new members(Adds comment)

By Susanna Twidale

LONDON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - A $1 billion fund created by top energy companies to curb climate change announced its first three investments on Friday and said two new members could be poised join the scheme.

The Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) was set up last year and includes Saudi Aramco and Royal Dutch Shell .

Pratima Rangarajan, OGCI chief executive, said she expected more companies to join and that Brazil's Petrobras and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) were among those interested.

"They are potentially joining and were observing today," she said in an interview with Reuters.

Other participants include BP , Total , Eni , Repsol , Statoil , CNPC, Pemex [PEMX.UL] and Reliance Industries .

Together, the 10 firms produce around 20 percent of the world's oil and gas and last year pledged to invest $1 billion over 10 years on technologies to curb climate change.[nL8N1D52Q7]

Rangarajan said new members would be expected to pledge a further $100 million each.

In the first investments, U.S. firm Solidia Technologies will receive funding for making cement with carbon dioxide instead of water, potentially lowering emissions by 70 percent and water use by 80 percent, the OGCI said.

It will also help U.S.-based Achates Power, which develops vehicle engines that produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions, to roll out its technology worldwide.

Financial details were not revealed.

Neither of the U.S. oil majors, Exxon or Chevron , are a part of the initiative. Rangarajan said the location of its members was not a factor in deciding where investments would be made.

"We have to be open to looking anywhere in the world for the best ideas," she said.

The OGCI also plans to help design a full-scale gas power plant with carbon capture and storage technology (CCS), although it did not specify where the project would be built, or how much funding would be allocated.

The International Energy Association (IEA) said CCS technology is vital if the target to limit a global rise in temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius, as set out in the Paris climate agreement, is to be met.

However, CCS project developers have struggled to bring down costs. There are currently fewer than 40 large-scale CCS projects globally and the majority of these are pilot schemes.

UPDATE 2-Phillips 66 wraps up strong quarter for big U.S. refiners - Reuters News

{{20171027T140220.956+0000}}UPDATE 2-Phillips 66 wraps up strong quarter for big U.S. refiners* 3rd-qtr refining margins up 24 pct at $10.49/bbl

(Adds analyst comment; details on Exxon, Chevron results; shares)

By Yashaswini Swamynathan

Oct 27 (Reuters) - Phillips 66 on Friday wrapped up a strong third quarter for big U.S. oil refiners that saw refining margins rise sharply in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.

Hurricanes have battered Texas since late August, sapping demand for crude oil and destroying gasoline lines in various parts of the U.S. Southeast and Midwest.

Industrywide margins to produce diesel fuel rose to a more than two-and-a-half year high of $26.95 a barrel, while gasoline margins hit a two-year high in early September.

Houston-based Phillips 66's margins to refine crude oil climbed 24 percent in the third quarter. Refining margins at smaller rivals Marathon Petroleum and Valero Energy also rose double-digit percentage points. [nL4N1N14WD]

Higher refining margins have helped lift earnings for the major integrated oil companies as well.

Exxon Mobil's downstream business on Friday posted a $1 billion rise in earnings, while rival Chevron said the metric helped it rake in profits. [nL2N1N20S2]

Shares of Phillips 66, which had risen nearly 9 percent since Harvey made landfall, were down 0.6 percent at $90.61 in morning trading on Friday.

"Beyond the results, investors may be trimming refining positions as earnings momentum slows after this very strong quarter," UBS Equities analyst Spiro Dounis, rated 5 out of 5, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine said.

Phillips 66, which also stores and transports fuels, said its consolidated earnings rose to $823 million on higher sales in its refining, chemicals and midstream units. [nBw9lFzNRa]

Adjusted earnings per share rose 54 percent to $1.66, beating the Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S estimate by 9 cents.

UPDATE 1-Chevron profit misses estimates on output decline; shares dip - Reuters News

{{20171027T125405.483+0000}}UPDATE 1-Chevron profit misses estimates on output decline; shares dip(Adds earnings comparison, stock movement)

By Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday as U.S. production slipped, offsetting a rise in oil and natural gas prices.

Shares of the San Ramon, California-based company fell 1.2 percent to $117 in premarket trading. The stock has gained less than 1 percent this year.

Net income in the third quarter was $1.95 billion, or $1.03 per share, compared with $1.28 billion, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding one-time items, Chevron earned 85 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected earnings of 98 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Despite the miss, Chevron said its results were moving in the right direction, with spending on large projects being scaled back.

"We continue to see improvement in the underlying pattern of earnings and cash flow," said Chief Executive John Watson, who will retire early next year.

Chevron's operations were largely not affected by Hurricane Harvey, which tore through the western U.S. Gulf Coast region in August.

Production grew 8 percent to 2.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.

In the United States, Chevron said its rising Gulf of Mexico and Permian Shale output was offset by natural declines in wells elsewhere. Production increased outside the United States.

Merck & Co Inc reports third-quarter results and investors will be looking out for information on sales of its cancer drug Keytruda, which would likely benefit from approvals for different indications this year. Updates on a cybersecurity attack that Merck said last quarter would likely affect its profit will also be of interest.

AbbVie Inc is expected to report higher third-quarter revenue, largely due to its blockbuster drug, Humira. Investors will watch for commentary on the drugmaker's pivotal trials, which are expected to read out later this year. Any news about Humira patents, which are expected to remain unchallenged till 2023, would also be noted.

Phillips 66 will probably post an increase in third-quarter profit as it benefited from higher refining margins due to supply disruptions caused by Hurricane Harvey. Investors will be looking for any forecast for the year and 2018, and any comments on the impact of volatile oil prices on its business.

Aviation electronics maker Rockwell Collins Inc is expected to report a rise in fourth-quarter profit and revenue, boosted by its acquisition of aircraft-interior maker B/E Aerospace Inc. Aerospace supplier United Technologies Corp struck a $30 billion agreement to buy Rockwell Collins last month.

Tiremaker Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co is likely to report a rise in third-quarter sales as demand for tires improve. However, profit is expected to drop partly due to higher raw material costs. Investors would be watching out for the company's comments on its financial forecasts and impacts from the recent hurricanes.

Imperial Oil Ltd posts third-quarter earnings. Canada's No. 2 integrated oil producer and refiner reported a better-than-expected profit for the third quarter last year as the its aggressive cost-cutting measures helped cushion the impact of lower oil prices. Its performance during this year's second quarter, however, was affected by planned and unplanned maintenance that curbed oil output. Imperial has said it will be taking steps this year and in 2018 to improve performance at its Kearl plant, which has struggled to hit full capacity of around 210,000 barrels per day.

Canadian uranium producer Cameco Corp reports third-quarter results as prices of the radioactive metal remain stubbornly low amid oversupply. Investors will be interested in any progress in selling Cameco's U.S. uranium production business and its latest cost-cutting efforts.

Canadian oilfield services contractor Precision Drilling Corp reports third-quarter earnings. The company, which also operates in the United States, is highly dependent on capital spending plans of oil and gas companies, which have been anxiously watching lacklustre benchmark oil prices.

{{20171026T172503.177+0000}}UPDATE 2-Venezuela graft probe claims another top executive at oil firm PDVSA (Recasts with prosecutor, details on cases, context)

By Alexandra Ulmer

CARACAS, Oct 26 (Reuters) - A top executive at Venezuela's PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] and 10 other oil executives were arrested as part of growing graft investigations that are ridding the state energy company of much of its top brass, the OPEC member's state prosecutor said on Thursday.

Orlando Chacin, who led the subsidiary for joint ventures with foreign partners, was arrested at PDVSA's Caracas headquarters on Tuesday, sources told Reuters on Thursday. He was the right-hand man of the company's former president, Eulogio Del Pino, who is now the nation's oil minister. [nL2N1N116U]

Ten other executives were arrested, including at the Petropiar and Petrozamora joint ventures with U.S. major Chevron Corp and Russia's Gazprombank, respectively, for alleged wrongdoing including overpricing and non-execution of planned projects, prosecutor Tarek Saab said in a press conference.

PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

President Nicolas Maduro's socialist government and PDVSA, which is formally known as Petroleos de Venezuela SA, have repeatedly vowed to take steps to combat corruption, which has affected the nation and its oil industry for decades. [nL2N1H61B7]

Opposition leaders say PDVSA has been crippled by malfeasance under 18 years of socialist rule. They say sporadic arrests are the result of infighting among rival government factions.

Sources close to PDVSA say the arrests owe more to turf wars for control of the company, which is the financial motor of Venezuela's ailing economy, than a wholesale effort to clean up graft. [nL1N1KT1ER]

The cash-strapped company, whose oil production has tumbled close to three-decade lows, has recently undergone a leadership change, with veteran oil executive Nelson Martinez replacing Del Pino in August.

Other once-prominent PDVSA executives under Del Pino have since been detained, including Pedro Leon, a powerful executive who led the company's Orinoco Belt development, and Gustavo Malave, the company's boss for the western region.

Saab, who in August replaced a dissident prosecutor who had split with Maduro, told Reuters last month he expected further arrests in widening oil-sector bribery scandals. The opposition dismisses Saab as a stooge, alleging he illegally replaced former prosecutor Luisa Ortega, who was removed after she broke with Maduro over human rights and has since fled the country.

A former Socialist Party governor in oil-rich Anzoategui, Saab says he has done more in a few months than Ortega did in years and has vowed not to back down.

"We still think there's a long road to go," Saab said in the press conference announcing the arrests.

Brazil vs Mexico: Latin America's fight for Big Oil's money - Reuters News

{{20171026T142924.689+0000}}Brazil vs Mexico: Latin America's fight for Big Oil's money* Latin American reforms luring oil firms to bid on blocks

* Global climate change policies add to urgency

* Brazil woos oil majors with prolific deepwater areas

* Mexico presents lower-cost, but politically riskier option

By Marianna Parraga and Alexandra Alper

HOUSTON/RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Brazil and Mexico are competing for a diminishing resource: the investment dollars of oil majors beating a retreat from the big-ticket offshore projects they once coveted.

After two waves of resource nationalism that left few openings in Latin America for energy giants such as Exxon Mobil Corp , Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Total , the tables are turning.

Governments throughout the continent are enacting reforms and changing contract terms to lure oil firms that have slashed spending as they adapt to lower crude prices. Global policy changes to address climate change have given an added sense of urgency to governments in the region and worldwide that are sitting on oil and gas reserves. They want to pump it before it becomes less valuable.

The competition pits Brazil's high-cost but prolific deepwater reserves against lower-cost oilfields in Mexico that come with a larger dose of political risk. [For a graphic on Brazil vs Mexico crude output and rig count click on http://tmsnrt.rs/2lfbP9n ]

"Both are attractive. Both have real potential," said Wael Sawan, Shell's executive vice president for deepwater. "We have as a company, I think as an industry, scarce capital resources to be able to make the investments that the particular projects in deep water require."

Sawan is among the executives from the world's top energy firms who have jetted into Rio de Janeiro this week, hoping to win fields in Brazil's latest auction.

Brazil has created a more conducive environment for investment than in the past, and venturing into Mexico looks exciting despite concerns over political risk and lack of infrastructure, he said.

Low crude prices have made oil firms choose carefully where they invest, but they need the substantial reserves Brazil and Mexico are offering. The rate that energy companies replace the barrels they produce is a key metric for shareholders, and offshore blocks such as those in Mexico and Brazil come with billions of barrels in available reserves.

BETTER TERMS FOR TECHNOLOGY

Latin America governments have relaxed deal terms and set accelerated auction schedules to lure investment to everything from ultra-deep water to mature fields that need specialist technology to squeeze more oil and gas from wells.

To boost its chances, Brazil has ended its requirement for state-controlled Petrobras to be the operator of deep-sea projects in the country's pre-salt province, which contains large volumes of high-value light oil. That gives majors more freedom to manage exploration and output.

Brazil has loosened local content requirements on equipment and supplies, which had previously slowed development, and set out a three-year calendar of oilfield auctions to facilitate planning for foreign firms.

Mexico has countered with an easier qualification process to bid in auctions and is selling geological data on oilfields for majors and service firms to reprocess, while offering flexible local content requirements according to field type.

For many oil majors, the Mexican side of the Gulf offers a familiar geology: the formations below the seabed are similar to those they have drilled for decades in the nearby U.S. waters. But unlike Brazil, there has been no deepwater development in Mexico, so more infrastructure needs to be built.

Beyond the potential of the oilfields, the two countries offer different political challenges.

Mexico's relatively recent reforms and a presidential election in 2018 imply a high political risk for majors, many of which were squeezed out of their Venezuela holdings by the country's socialist governments in the last decade.

Foreign firms are beginning to operate in Mexico just as the country's relationship with the United States worsens as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks trade concessions from Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto.

Trump's public statements on Mexico have riled many Mexicans, giving the leftist opposition firebrand Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who is openly critical of Trump, a lift in the opinion polls. Lopez Obrador has said he could hold a referendum on the energy reform if he became president. [nL4N1FV4PI]

"I have no doubts that Mexico could be more attractive than Brazil," said Francisco Monaldi, a fellow in Latin American Energy Policy at Rice University's Baker Institute.

"But the possible combination of Trump and Lopez Obrador is scary for investors," Monaldi said.

Mexico's next bidding round should be concluded in January and includes 29 blocks that hold an estimated 4.2 billion barrels of prospective reserves. Another 35 blocks in shallow water areas with potentially 2 billion barrels will follow, with results expected to be announced in March. [nL2N1MU1PT]

MAJOR BIDS FOR OIL

Brazilian authorities have billed the round to be held on Friday its most competitive yet. Some 16 firms qualified to bid for blocks in the country's pre-salt reservoirs, where oil and gas are trapped under layers of salt beneath the ocean floor.

"In the last year we have made extraordinary advances in the regulatory framework," said Joao Carlos de Luca, an adviser to the Brazilian Petroleum, Gas and Biofuels Institute that represents oil companies working in the country. "That has put Brazil back on the map."

The previous auction, for 287 blocks in September, received $1.2 billion in offers, far more than expected. That was largely down to Exxon, which stole the show with aggressive bids. Until that round, Exxon was one of the few big oil firms absent from Brazil's offshore areas.

Exxon has spent heavily this year on projects to replenish diminishing reserves, including in the U.S. Permian Basin shale play.

In South America, Exxon has also invested in Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale areas while venturing into offshore Guyana along with Hess Corp in a $4.4 billion offshore project. [nL2N1M929Q] [nL3N1JD3UC] [nL2N1LI1RA]

In Ecuador, where every administration in recent decades has changed the country's oil contracts, President Lenin Moreno has called two new bidding rounds in 2018 for up to 24 blocks under more attractive terms. [nL2N1MH14S]

Argentina also plans to announce next year a bidding round for oil and gas exploration blocks off its Atlantic coast after a 15-year hiatus on offshore auctions.

"Current conditions are exactly opposed to those for nationalism. Everybody is now offering fields, but the spots available in the majors' portfolios under $50-60 per barrel of crude are just a few," Monaldi said.

Other oil majors including BP Plc and Chevron Corp also are exploring investment opportunities in the region, from the Gulf of Mexico to Argentina.

But making the case within oil majors for offshore capital-intensive projects is a challenge, said Javier La Rosa, president of Chevron's Brazil unit, at an industry conference in Rio on Wednesday.

"I face this battle each year when our corporate business plan is put out," he said. "It is not easy to convince shareholders to spend more money on deepwater fields when there are other lower cost options still available."

BREAKINGVIEWS-Western oil drillers flirt with OPEC-style dilemma - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20171025T194604.301+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Western oil drillers flirt with OPEC-style dilemma(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Lauren Silva Laughlin

DALLAS, Oct 25 (Reuters Breakingviews) - It's a dilemma worthy of the OPEC cartel. U.S.-focused oil producers may be targeting higher returns rather than pumping more crude. Majors like Exxon Mobil and Chevron , reporting third-quarter earnings on Friday, know the trade-off, too. Selling less oil at a higher price is appealing if everyone joins in. But a history of internal tensions at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries shows how easily self-interest prevails.

Oil companies are better off than 20 months ago when the West Texas Intermediate price hovered around $30 a barrel: it is now above $50. Still, crude is plentiful and Anadarko Petroleum , Hess and ConocoPhillips , three large U.S. producers, cut capital-spending estimates last quarter. The U.S. rig count is falling, and earlier this week Halliburton Chief Executive Jeffrey Miller said his clients were focusing on "cost-effective" production.

Some are shifting compensation plans for top executives to include more profit-related metrics like return on capital. Chevron restructured its pay in the spring, Evercore ISI notes, urging others to follow. In theory, if companies avoid drilling in expensive places they'll improve margins, and the reduced supply should in turn push up prices.

OPEC illustrates the problem, though. The oil cartel's members are supposed to stick to agreed output levels. The organization said last November it would cut production, starting this year. Relatively strong compliance has contributed to tighter supply and hence, arguably, to the more than 25 percent run-up in the Brent crude price since June. Yet compliance has always been variable and only recently Saudi Arabia, for one, was over-producing, favoring its own market share and short-term cash flow over a collective effort to cut supply.

The disparate goals are magnified for companies which answer to shareholders and don't collude on production. Chevron, for example, has a strong U.S. shale-drilling presence and one of the most profitable locations in the West Texas Permian region, according to analysts. If the oil price jumps and the company can produce more, it's hard to see it passing up the opportunity. Harold Hamm, the Continental Resources CEO, has suggested U.S. drillers will produce less. Even with more attention on profitability, it's more likely output will surge whenever producers reckon they can make a buck.

CONTEXT NEWS

- ConocoPhillips is set to report third-quarter earnings on Oct. 26. Exxon Mobil and Chevron follow on Oct. 27.

- Anadarko Petroleum and ConocoPhillips cut their capital-spending estimates last quarter, and U.S. rig counts have fallen in 10 of the past 13 weeks, according to Baker Hughes, though the count is still 64 percent higher than its level at the same time last year.

- Halliburton Chief Executive Jeffrey Miller said on Oct. 23 in its third-quarter earnings call with analysts that the company's customers, which include oil producers in the U.S. Permian and Bakken basins, were focused on "cost-effective" production. He also said that in North America, a $50 per barrel oil price "drives significant activity."

- On Oct. 11, the Energy Information Administration projected U.S. crude production would average 9.2 million barrels per day in 2017 and 9.9 million bpd in 2018, surpassing the previous record of 9.6 million bpd in 1970. The 2017 estimates fell slightly from the previous month, but the forecast for 2018 was slightly higher. Continental Resources Chief Executive Harold Hamm said on Sept. 21 that the EIA's predictions for U.S. oil production were "flat wrong."

* OPEC member aims to lift oil output to 1.8 mln bpd by Jan

(Adds comments on output, OPEC)

By Wendell Roelf

CAPE TOWN, Oct 24 (Reuters) - A refinery with capacity to process 650,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil being built in Nigeria is due to come onstream by the end of 2019, the oil minister said on Tuesday.

"That should be enough to meet local needs," Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu told an oil and conference in Cape Town, referring to the Dangote refinery.

State oil firm NNPC last year launched bidding to find partners to overhaul its ailing refineries, which hardly produce any petrol due to decades of mismanagement and widespread graft, leaving OPEC member Nigeria reliant on imported oil products.

Kachikwu said Nigeria was close to finalising the process for private partners to revamp three existing refineries, adding a total of 450,000 bpd, part of the effort by Africa's biggest economy to reduce its reliance on imports.

Kachikwu said 26 firms had indicated their interest in the revamp projects that will require investment of $2 billion.

"We are almost at a threshold of finalising the process of selection," he said, adding that it could announce its selection by January or February.

The government has previously said it was in talks with Chevron , Total and ENI .

Kachikwu told reporters that Nigeria aimed to lift oil output in January to 1.8 million bpd from about 1.6 million to 1.7 million bpd now, but would not breach a ceiling agreed with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. "If we get to 1.8 (million), then we need to say 'hey, close off the taps, because we need to comply," he said.

He also said oil prices were now encouraging but OPEC had not ruled out further cuts to shore up the market.

"The market is balancing fast .... But do we need to see more cuts? We'll see," he said.

OPEC, Russia and other producers cut oil output by about 1.8 million bpd since January. The pact runs to March 2018, but they are considering extending it.

BAGHDAD, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Iraq may offer Chevron and Total terms to develop the Majnoon oilfield different from those it had given to Royal Dutch Shell, Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said on Saturday.

Iraq will develop the Majnoon oil field in southern Iraqi by its own means until it can find a foreign partner, Luaibi told reporters, adding that no company has been selected yet.

Luaibi said on Oct. 9 that Chevron and Total are among the companies that have expressed interest in developing Majnoon that Shell has said it wants to leave because of unfavourable changes to fiscal terms.

Iraq may offer Total, Chevron terms different from Shell for Majnoon field development - Reuters News

{{20171021T135425.958+0000}}Iraq may offer Total, Chevron terms different from Shell for Majnoon field developmentBAGHDAD, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Iraqi oil minister Jabar al-Luaibi said he had sought clarifications from Russia's biggest oil company Rosneft about contracts it signed with the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region.

Rosneft "assured that the contracts are preliminary and not ready for implementation," the minister told reporters in Baghdad, giving no further details.

Rosneft agreed on Thursday to take control of Iraqi Kurdistan's main oil pipeline, boosting its investment in the autonomous region to $3.5 billion.

The Iraqi government has warned companies against signing deals with the Kurdistan region and Baghdad's forces this week wrested control of the oil-rich Kirkuk from Kurdish forces.

Rosneft agreed on Thursday to take control of Iraqi Kurdistan's main oil pipeline, boosting its investment in the autonomous region to $3.5 billion.

Rosneft will be investing in expanding the pipeline hoping to boost its capacity by a third to 950,000 barrels per day. That is the equivalent of about 1 percent of global supply. [nL8N1MU7TW] The pipeline usually carries 600,000 bpd but volumes dropped to just over 200,000 bpd this week after Iraqi forces took over the region of Kirkuk. The pipeline carries crude from Kirkuk and other fields in northern Iraqi to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan.

WEEK AHEAD

A slew of Dow 30 companies will report results in the week, including United Technologies Corp, Caterpillar Inc, 3M Co and McDonald's Corp on Tuesday; Visa Inc, Coca-Cola Co and Boeing Co on Wednesday; Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp on Thursday, with Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and Merck & Co Inc closing the week. United Technologies is expected to report lower third-quarter profit, partly as sales of its Otis elevators slow in China amid excess supply, and on investments to boost production of its Geared Turbofan aircraft engines. Caterpillar is expected to report higher profit and revenue for the third quarter as the recovery in its construction business gained momentum. Strong demand for McDonald's $1 drinks and premium burgers and its mainly franchised model is expected to have offset any impact from hurricanes in the quarter. Visa is expected to report a rise in earnings, helped by continued strength in payment volumes due to a modest rise in consumer spending. Strong sales of Dunkin Donuts' bottled iced coffee, which is manufactured and distributed by Coca-Cola, is expected to have benefited the beverage maker's quarter. Boeing is expected to report a fall in third-quarter profit and flat revenue. Microsoft is expected to report a rise in first-quarter revenue and profit as the company reaps the benfit of its push to the cloud, led by its flagship cloud computing platform, Azure. Intel is expected to report a rise in third-quarter profit, helped by continued stability in the PC market and strong growth in its data center business. Exxon Mobil and Chevron are both expected to post a rise in third-quarter profit. When Merck reports third-quarter results, investors will be looking out for sales of its cancer drug Keytruda, which would likely benefit from approvals for different indications this year, and updates on a cybersecurity attack that Merck said would likely affect its profit.

A flurry of economic data is due, including third-quarter GDP and October consumer sentiment on Friday, weekly jobless claims figures on Thursday, September data on durable goods and new home sales on Wednesday; and Markit manufacturing and services Purchasing Managers' Indexes for October on Tuesday. The U.S. economy is forecast to have expanded at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the July-September period, compared to a 3.1 percent annual rate in the April-June. The final reading of University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index is expected to come in at 100.8 for October. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits are expected to have increased 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 235,000 for the week ended Oct. 21. Meanwhile, non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, is expected to have risen 0.5 percent in September. New home sales are expected to have decreased 0.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 555,000 units in September.

On Thursday, Google's parent company Alphabet Inc is expected to report a rise in third-quarter revenue as it benefits from strong mobile search traffic and larger-than-expected contribution from its non-search businesses like its popular video service YouTube, Play Store and Google Cloud.

General Motors Co will release third-quarter results on Tuesday, while Ford Motor Co reports third-quarter results on Thursday.

The European Central Bank's governing council meets on Thursday in Frankfurt and will announce its decision on interest rate. ECB President Mario Draghi is expected to hold a press conference after the meeting. The central bank is expected to signal continued policy accommodation by keeping interest rates at record lows for longer.

World's largest online retailer Amazon.com Inc is expected to report a rise in third-quarter revenue on Thursday, driven by growth in its cloud computing and retail businesses. However, Amazon's bottom line continues to take a hit amid its costly expansion into new shopping categories and countries. Investors and analysts will be looking out for any updates on Amazon's $13.7 billion acquisition of specialty grocer Whole Foods Market as well as the fourth-quarter forecast.

Lockheed Martin Corp is scheduled to report third-quarter results on Tuesday. Weapons maker Northrop Grumman Corp is expected to report higher third-quarter revenue, partly helped by higher sales of F-35 fighter jets on Wednesday. Northrop makes the center fuselage for the jets and this section forms a significant portion of the aircraft's internal weapons bay and internal fuel capacity. Tomahawk missile maker Raytheon Co is expected to report higher third-quarter profit on Thursday and revenue as heightened U.S. and allied military operations and global uncertainty increases demand for laser-guided bombs and missiles. Raytheon and other U.S. weapons makers are also expected to benefit in the coming year from an increase in overall defense spending under President Donald Trump. Investors will look for an update on full year financial forecast.

Japan holds a snap general election on Sunday. A Reuters poll conducted from Sept. 28 to Oct. 12 found that Japanese companies overwhelmingly want Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ruling coalition to stay in power, but about two-thirds want it to lose seats. The survey suggested corporations want political stability but don't want to hand Abe a landslide victory for fear he might become complacent about reviving the economy. On the same day, Argentines head to the polls for midterm legislative elections that could determine the future of market-friendly President Mauricio Macri's reform agenda. Meanwhile, Kenya holds fresh presidential elections on Thursday, after Supreme Court nullified August vote

On Wednesday, Amgen Inc, the world's largest biotechnology company, is expected to report higher third-quarter profit on increased sales of newer products and cost controls. Biogen Inc is expected to report higher third-quarter revenue on Tuesday, largely due to sales of its spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) drug, Spinraza. Edwards Lifesciences Corp reports third-quarter results on the same day and investors will hope it can maintain the momentum seen in the second quarter, when the company enjoyed double-digit growth in sales of its transcatheter heart valves and significantly raised its full-year profit forecast. Eli Lilly and Co is also expected to report third-quarter results on Tuesday. On the same day, pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holdings Co is set to report third-quarter earnings, a week after its biggest client Anthem Inc ended a deal with the company and launched its own pharmacy business. When Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc announces fourth-quarter revenue on Wednesday, it will be the first quarter that the drugstore chain operator will report since announcing the scrapping of its previous agreement to buy Rite Aid Corp and instead buying nearly half of the smaller rival's stores. Boston Scientific Corp, which will post third-quarter earnings on Thursday, is expected to report improved sales from its cardiovascular devices business as larger rival Abbott Laboratories' hold on this market weakens. AbbVie Inc, which is due to report third-quarter results on Friday, is likely to report higher revenue largely due to its blockbuster drug, Humira. Investors will watch for commentary regarding the drugmaker's pivotal trials, which are expected to read out later this year.

American Airlines Group Inc, the No.1 U.S. airline, is expected to report higher third-quarter revenue on Thursday, helped by healthy demand during the summer travel season. However, the company's profit will take a hit because of the hurricanes, which resulted in nearly 8,000 canceled flights and cost about $75 million in pre-tax earnings. Southwest Airlines Co is expected to report a drop in third-quarter profit on the same day, partly due to canceled flights during recent hurricanes. However, revenue is expected to rise. Investors will look for the company's commentary on impacts from the hurricanes and its financial forecast for the year.

Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc is expected to report a rise in its third-quarter profit and revenue, helped by strong demand for its graphics chips and Ryzen processors for PCs, on Tuesday. AMD is likely to benefit from a stabilizing PC market. Investors will also be looking at the adoption of the chipmaker's new products, including EPYC server processor and mobile Ryzen CPU. On the same day, Chipmaker Texas Instruments Inc is expected to post a rise in third-quarter revenue, helped by demand for analog and embedded chip products from the automotive and industrial markets. Investors and analysts will focus on the company's current quarter forecast.

Data storage company Western Digital Corp is expected to post a third-quarter profit on Thursday, from a loss last year, helped by a rise in demand for its flash memory chips. Western Digital recently lost its bid for Toshiba's memory chip unit to a rival consortium led by Bain Capital, creating a legal battle between the joint venture partners. This loss also puts at risk the future of NAND chip supply for the hard disk drive maker.

Microblogging website Twitter Inc is expected to continue to report declines in third-quarter revenue and profit when it announces results on Thursday. After Twitter failed to add users in the previous quarter, all eyes will be on whether the social network can boost its user growth. Slowing user growth and deals losses are adding to concerns around Twitter's ability to compete with giants like Facebook and Snapchat for advertising dollars, amidst a push towards video content.

Dunkin Brands Group Inc reports third-quarter results on Thursday. Traffic to Dunkin's mainstay U.S. Dunkin' Donuts cafes have fallen for five quarters in a row. The company has said it will offer a variety of local and national promotions, but will not aggressively discount to match McDonald's $1 coffee specials, which have been helping the fast-food giant gain traffic. Online food ordering and delivery company GrubHub Inc is expected to report a rise in third-quarter revenue on Wednesday, helped by addition of new restaurants to its supply chain. Hershey Co, which reports third-quarter earnings on Thursday, cut its forecast for full-year net sales growth in July even as it works to cut costs and launch new and reinvented candy products. The company is also reported to be bidding for Nestle's U.S. confectionery business, which was put on the block earlier this year.

On Thursday, U.S.-based refiner Valero Energy Corp is expected to post a bigger profit helped by higher refining margins and partly from increased activity in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. Investors will be on a lookout for any comments related to work operations and forecast for the current quarter. Canadian oil and gas producer Husky Energy reports third-quarter results on the same day, while MEG Energy is expected to post a third-quarter loss. U.S. oil producer ConocoPhillips, which saw its operations dented by August's Hurricane Harvey, is expected to swing to a third-quarter profit also on Thursday. Canada's largest oil and gas producer Suncor Energy Inc reports its third-quarter results on Wednesday. Canadian oilfield services contractor Precision Drilling Corp reports third-quarter earnings on Friday. Whiting Petroleum Corp, the largest oil producer in North Dakota's Bakken shale region, is expected to report a smaller third-quarter loss on Wednesday.

Mattel Inc reports third-quarter results on Thursday. While Barbie sales picked up in the third quarter following a disappointing second quarter, total doll sales are down, according to analysts. Investors will also be interested in comments on how the Toys "R" Us bankruptcy would affect Mattel, which gets about 10 percent of its revenue from the retailer.

Hotel operator Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc is expected to report a decline in third-quarter revenue and profit on Thursday, as it completed the spinoff of Park Hotels and Resorts and Hilton Grand Vacations this year. Hilton has benefited from an uptick in corporate demand, as companies spend more based on improved business sentiment following Donald Trump's election as president in November. Investors will look for the company's comments on its financial forecast and impacts from the recent hurricanes.

Printer and copier maker Xerox Corp is expected to report a dip in third-quarter revenue on Thursday. Xerox, which separated itself into two independent and publicly traded companies last year, is beefing up its product offerings to give a boost to its sales.

On Friday, Canadian uranium producer Cameco reports third-quarter results as prices of the radioactive metal remain stubbornly low amid oversupply. Investors will be interested in any progress in selling Cameco's U.S. uranium production business and its latest cost-cutting efforts.

Canadian fertilizer company Potash Corp of Saskatchewan Inc reports third-quarter results on Thursday. An update on its planned merger with Agrium Inc is likely to be the focus.

Bank of Canada will make its interest rate announcement on Wednesday and is largely expected to hold rates at 1 percent after two back-to-back hikes. Markets will be looking at the central bank's updated economic forecasts, as well as any guidance from policymakers as to how fast rates will continue to go up from here. On Tuesday, the Canadian government will release its economic and fiscal update. After a smaller-than-expected deficit in the previous fiscal year and recent strong economic growth, analysts expect that the government's finances will be in a better position than projected in the budget earlier this year.

Low-cost integrated zinc producer Nexa Resources is planning to list itself on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. The company is offering 31 million ADS to be priced between $18-$21 and expects to raise about $604 million. Canada's Roots Ltd begins trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Wednesday, after pricing its initial public offering at C$12 per share, raising about C$200 million. It will trade under the ticker ROOT.

The Brazilian central bank meets for a two-day monetary policy committee meeting on Tuesday in Brasilia. Brazil's inflation rate sped up to the fastest in three months in mid-October and the reading should support the central bank's plan to slow the pace of interest rate cuts as the economy emerges from the deepest recession in more than 100 years, even though inflation still lags far behind the official target. On Thursday, statistics agency IBGE is likely to release September's producer price index numbers. Brazilian current account data is also expected on the same day.

Investors will look out for Mexico's first half-month inflation numbers for October on Tuesday. Consumer prices during the first half of September had risen 0.34 percent. Mexican retail sales data for August is awaited on Wednesday. Retail sales rose 0.3 percent in July. On Thursday, the national statistics agency will report September's trade balance, which will follow a $1.283 billion deficit in August.

ON MONDAY

Halliburton Co, the No.3 oilfield services provider, is expected to report a higher third-quarter profit, helped by increased drilling activity in North America. However, Halliburton has warned about the unsustainable nature of business in the region. After bigger rivals Schlumberger and Baker Hughes echoed those thoughts, investors will be looking for any remedies Halliburton has to offer to mitigate the slowdown and negotiate volatile oil prices.

Boston-based custody bank State Street Corp is expected to report a rise in net interest income for the third quarter, aided by higher interest rates and modest loan growth. Results will also be driven by higher market levels, despite seasonally slower foreign exchange and securities lending revenues.

Toymaker Hasbro Inc, which reports third-quarter results, said in July that second-half revenue will be skewed more towards fourth quarter due to the release timing of movie franchises such as Star Wars and customers shifting to sourcing inventory just-in-time for the holidays. Investors will also be interested in comments on how the Toys "R" Us bankruptcy would affect Hasbro, which gets about 10 percent of its revenue from the retailer.

LIVECHAT – SECTOR FOCUS: EQUITIES Equities continue their run and the volatility index continues to plunge.

{{20171020T103541.602+0000}}Chevron approves new tech investment to raise output at North Sea fieldOct 20 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron has approved an investment to increase output from its Captain oilfield by using a new water-injection technology for the first time in the North Sea, the company said on Friday.

Six long-reach horizontal wells will be drilled in the 20-year-old field, around 90 miles northeast of Aberdeen. They are expected to raise the recovery rate 5 to 7 percent.

Polymerised water will be injected into the field's oil reservoir, a new technique to tap oil reserves that are hard to reach with conventional drilling methods. It will be the first time the technology has been applied on this scale in the North Sea.

The polymer injection wells will come on stream from 2018 to 2021, a spokeswoman said. She declined to disclose how much they would cost.

Approving the investment for the first phase of project "is an important milestone in the development of the technology, which we believe will improve the recovery rate from older fields and help extend the life of assets," said Greta Lydecker, managing director of Chevron's European upstream division.

Chevron is the operator of the field and owns 85 percent of it. Dana Petroleum [KOILCD.UL] holds a 15 percent stake.

Oil and gas output from Britain's part of the North Sea has dropped since the turn of the century as old fields are depleted and investment in new projects dwindles.

However, some oil companies, like Chevron, are investing in new technologies to reach resources that were previously unavailable, helping British oil and gas production to rise slightly over the past two years.

UPDATE 2-Woodside on track for Myanmar development plan by end-2018 - CEO - Reuters News

{{20171019T042700.186+0000}}UPDATE 2-Woodside on track for Myanmar development plan by end-2018 - CEO(Repeats with no changes to text)

Oct 19 (Reuters) - Woodside Petroleum , Australia's largest independent oil and gas producer, reported a 7 percent dip in third-quarter revenue as output from the North West Shelf in Western Australia declined, and slashed its full-year output guidance range.

Revenue in the quarter slipped to $914 million from $988 million in the year-ago period, short of UBS's forecast of $992 million, while output fell to 20.3 mmboe from 25.2 mmboe last year, compared with UBS's forecast of 21.9 mmboe.

Woodside also said it had appointed Sherry Duhe as its chief financial officer, effective Dec. 1.

The company narrowed its forecast for full-year production to 84 million to 86 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe), from 84 mmboe to 90 mmboe, citing the timing of the first train of its Wheatstone project.

Woodside said the second liquefied natural gas (LNG) train from the Wheatstone project, in which it holds a 13 percent stake, is expected in 6 to 8 months.

The project, which is run by Chevron Corp and started LNG production earlier this month, is expected to contribute more than 13 mmboe to the company's annual output once fully operational, Woodside added.

The company said the Pyi Tharyar-1 well in Block A-6 in Myanmar intersected a thin column of gas-saturated sands, which is unlikely to be commercially recoverable.

Woodside has the most petroleum acreage offshore Myanmar, which has also been targeted by majors like Royal Dutch Shell and France's Total SA . The Australian company has targeted the country as one of its main sources of growth after 2021.

Woodside shares fell as much as 0.9 percent in early trade while the broader market <.AXJO> was flat.

By Christina Martin and Sonali Paul

Oct 19 (Reuters) - Woodside Petroleum played down disappointing results from its exploration wells in Myanmar on Thursday, with Chief Executive Peter Coleman saying the company is still on track to decide on development plans there by the end of 2018.

Australia's top independent oil and gas producer cancelled plans for a seismic survey in Myanmar after drilling five wells scheduled for 2017, Coleman said in an interview, confirming a Reuters report this week. [nL4N1MR2TI]

Coleman was speaking after Woodside cut its full-year output forecast, reporting third-quarter revenue fell 7.5 percent from a year earlier to $914 million, missing some analysts' forecasts. Shares slipped as much as 2 percent.

A well on the A6 block off the southwest coast of Myanmar found only residual gas which was "unlikely to be commercially recoverable", Woodside said, while a well in Block AD7 off the northwest coast hit "water-wet sands", following three finds earlier.

Coleman said the company had decided not to go ahead with extra seismic work as it already had enough information to digest ahead of drilling in 2018.

"In the end we decided we were already pretty much stretched on where we were and it was prudent for us to stop," he told Reuters.

Woodside is among the biggest holders of petroleum acreage offshore Myanmar, where its partners include majors Royal Dutch Shell and France's Total SA , and has targeted the country as a key source of growth after 2021.

"We've really said by the end of 2018 we will know what the development looks like in Myanmar," Coleman said. "We're still on schedule for that."

Coleman said the Rohingya refugee crisis in Myanmar had not affected offshore operations at all, but the company did have to cancel talks with some fishing communities in troubled areas.

"It's something we're obviously concerned about, we're watching closely," he said.

Analysts said the latest drilling results were not a big setback for its aspirations in Myanmar.

"They've had a successful run so far. The law of averages says there's going to be a dry hole every now and then," said John Hirjee, an analyst at Deutsche Bank.

For the full year, Woodside narrowed its guidance range to 84 million to 86 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe), lowering the top end from 90 mmboe due to the slightly delayed start-up of the Wheatstone liquefied natural gas project, run by Chevron Corp .

Activists set talks with Chevron on Myanmar rights concerns - Reuters News

{{20171018T200318.248+0000}}Activists set talks with Chevron on Myanmar rights concernsBy Ross Kerber and Ernest Scheyder

BOSTON/HOUSTON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Shareholder activists will speak with Chevron Corp next week to request the energy giant use its influence with the government of Myanmar to press for a resolution of ethnic violence that has led to a refugee crisis.

Joshua Brockwell, communications director for Azzad Asset Management, said the firm and other activist investors planned to press Chevron executives on Oct. 25 to discuss a letter they sent that also asked the company to consider cutting ties with "governments complicit in genocide."

Chevron, the second-largest U.S.-based oil producer, does business in Myanmar through a subsidiary, Unocal Myanmar Offshore Co Ltd. It has projects that include a minority interest in natural gas production and a pipeline, according to the company's website.

Asked about Azzad's concerns, Chevron spokesman Melissa Ritchie said "Chevron conducts our business in a responsible manner, respecting the law and universal human rights to benefit the communities where we work, including Myanmar."

"In our experience, peace, stability and the protection of human rights provide the best foundation for the economic development of a region and associated improvement in living conditions for communities," she said via e-mail, confirming that the company would speak to the investors.

More than 536,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar since Aug. 25, when coordinated Rohingya insurgent attacks sparked a ferocious military response, with the fleeing people accusing security forces of arson, killings and rape. [nL4N1MR38G]

In September the United Nations' top human rights official accused Myanmar of conducting a "cruel military operation" against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state, calling it "a textbook example of ethnic cleansing."

Azzad's Brockwell said his firm was "growing increasingly concerned over the lack of a constructive response from Chevron" on its requests since the letter was sent, in August.

Brockwell said it might also file a shareholder resolution for Chevron's next annual meeting, similar to one Azzad and others filed for its 2017 meeting in May. That resolution called for a report evaluating whether Chevron should stop doing business with governments complicit in genocide or crimes against humanity. The resolution received support from 6 percent of shares voted.

In addition to Azzad, an Islamic finance firm, the other lead filer of the resolution was a Catholic religious order, the Ursuline Sisters of Tildonk.

Simon Billenness, executive director of International Campaign for the Rohingya, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group, said it planned to send similar letters to other companies doing business in Myanmar, signed by shareholders in those companies.

{{20171018T194441.474+0000}}UPDATE 3-Chevron says fire did not affect El Segundo's main process units (Updates with company's response)

Oct 18 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp said a fire that was extinguished at its El Segundo, California refinery late Tuesday did not occur near any of the facility's main units and has not affected the company's ability to deliver its products.

The fire at Chevron's largest refinery on the U.S. West Coast occurred at about 10:30 p.m. PDT on Tuesday and was put out by 11:18 p.m., the company said.

"The fire was confined to a distribution manifold adjacent to some storage tanks and did not occur in proximity to any of the facility's main process units," a company spokesman said in an email response to Reuters.

Earlier, Chevron reported the fire was on a pump between two tanks and was causing a release of an unknown amount of gas oil at the refinery, according to a filing with the California Emergency Management Agency.

There were no reports of injuries or fatalities, the filing with state pollution regulators said, adding it was unknown if any waterways or storm drains were impacted.

The cause of the incident is still under investigation and there are no expected impacts to the company's ability to supply to customers in the region, Chevron said.

El Segundo, with a crude distillation capacity of 269,000 barrels per day, mainly produces fuels such as gasoline, jet fuel and diesel.

Chevron reports pump fire at El Segundo, Calif. refinery - 路透新闻

{{20171018T063214.661+0000}}Chevron reports pump fire at El Segundo, Calif. refineryOct 18 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp reported a ground fire on a pump between two tanks is causing the release of an unknown amount of gas oil at its refinery in El Segundo, California, according to a filing with state pollution regulators.

"This is an ongoing release and the pump is still on fire," the filing with California Emergency Management Agency said late Tuesday.

Multiple fire agencies were on scene at the 269,000 barrels per day refinery site and it was unknown if any waterways or storm drains were impacted, the filing said.

Chevron ditches plans to drill off Australia's south coast - Reuters News

{{20171012T233942.534+0000}}Chevron ditches plans to drill off Australia's south coastMELBOURNE, Oct 13 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron Corp has abandoned plans to explore the deep water off Australia's south coast, long seen as a promising prospect, as weak oil prices are making the work hard to justify, the company said on Friday.

Chevron's move follows a decision by BP Plc a year ago to walk away from the waters known as the Great Australian Bight, which industry consultants Wood Mackenzie have estimated could hold 1.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent.

"While the Great Australian Bight is one of Australia's most prospective frontier hydrocarbon regions, in the current low oil price environment it was not able to compete for capital in Chevron's global portfolio," Chevron said in a statement.

The decision came a week after Chevron acquired more exploration acreage off Western Australia, where it said it plans to focus its efforts, having already invested billions of dollars in two huge liquefied natural gas projects there.

Australia's top oil and gas industry group said Chevron's decision reflected the tough conditions in the oil market which has led oil companies to slash spending. Exploration in the country, both onshore and offshore, has dropped to 30-year lows.

"While several other companies continue to develop exploration plans for the bight, the international environment for the oil and gas industry is challenging," Matthew Doman, a director at the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, said in a statement.

Norway's Statoil picked up some of BP's Great Australian Bight stakes in June, giving it full control of two permits. It has committed to drill one exploration well before Oct. 30, 2019. [nL8N1J56DD]

Green groups have fought against drilling in the Great Australian Bight, warning that oil spills in the notoriously rough waters could threaten whale breeding grounds, pristine coastline and fishing towns.

"The news Chevron has given up on drilling in the bight means the coastal communities of Southern Australia have dodged another bullet, but the threat of Statoil still looms," Greenpeace Australia Pacific Senior Campaigner Nathaniel Pelle said in a statement.

UPDATE 1-Bids on Lebanon offshore energy blocks close  - Reuters News

{{20171012T213517.817+0000}}UPDATE 1-Bids on Lebanon offshore energy blocks close (Adds comment on number of bids)

BEIRUT, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Lebanon's Energy Minister Cesar Abi Khalil on Thursday said a tender had closed on a first round of offshore energy blocks, and told local media that two consortiums had submitted bids.

It will take years for revenue from any of the blocks to start flowing to the country, he said in a televised news conference.

"The first licensing round for oil exploration closed," he said. The country's petroleum authority and the cabinet will evaluate the bids, he added.

The local English-language Daily Star reported that Abi Khalil told it that two bids were submitted and that there were French, Italian and Russian companies involved in those bids.

Lebanon relaunched the licensing round for five offshore blocks (1, 4, 8, 9 and 10) in January after a three-year delay due to political paralysis. It extended the bid deadline in September. [nL8N1LP2YO]

Lebanon sits on the Levant Basin in the eastern Mediterranean along with Cyprus, Egypt, Israel and Syria. A number of gas fields have been discovered there since 2009, such as the Leviathan and Tamar fields.

A total of 52 companies qualified earlier in the year to bid in this round.

When the process was first launched in 2013, 46 companies qualified to take part in bidding, 12 of them as operators, including Chevron Corp , Total SA and Exxon Mobil Corp .

SINGAPORE, Oct 12 (Reuters) - The appeal of Indonesia's oil and gas sector is improving for some independent producers as the resource-rich nation scrambles to reduce its dependence on imports and fill a gap left by the exit of some producers, the head of GSS Energy told Reuters.

"There could be some assets that will be available that three or five years ago would have been very difficult to gain access to for a relatively small and new player like us," said Sydney Yeung, group chief executive at Singapore-listed GSS Energy at the Reuters Global Commodity Summit.

Amid depressed oil prices, international oil companies such as ConocoPhillips and Chevron have reduced their holdings in Indonesia, a former member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. As a result, the country has struggled to attract fresh investment and to develop new fields. [nL4N1F92DN][nL3N1BS0ZN][nJ9N1DH01M]

The risks that energy investors face in Indonesia are highlighted by recent change to the development plans of the Masela gas field developed by Japan's Inpex <1605.T>. There has also been a long-standing dispute between France's Total and Indonesia's government over the Mahakam block, the country's largest gas-producing field.

The recent departure of the producers, as well as its drive to reduce its dependence on imports, "can only force the government to move faster" in implementing more favourable policies and incentives for operators, said Yeung at the Summit held at the Reuters office in Singapore.

Indonesia's crude oil output peaked at around 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in the mid-1990s. But with few significant oil discoveries in the past 10 years, production has fallen to roughly half that as old fields have matured and died.

"Indonesia is a net importer of oil not because there's a lack of resources," said Yeung, but because "previous policies that did not encourage or anticipate the demand they needed and did not push as aggressively as they should have."

With oil demand at about 1.2 million bpd and production at about 800,000 bpd, investors in Indonesia's oil and gas sector will have a big supply gap to fill, said Yeung.

The energy industry is a vital part of the Indonesian economy, but its contribution to state revenue has dropped from around 25 percent in 2006 to an expected 3.4 percent this year, according to data compiled by consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers.

"It's very clear to me that Indonesia's number one agenda is to push its economy forward as fast as they can but that would be difficult without greater energy supply," said Sydney.

HOUSTON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp said on Monday it was working to restore its 340,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery to full production after the passage of Hurricane Nate.

Energy industry intelligence service Genscape said the refinery was shut on Saturday as Nate was charging toward the Mississippi coast.

"We have completed our post-storm assessment and are working toward returning the Pascagoula Refinery to full production," said Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall.

A Reuters witness said on Sunday the refinery appeared to be undamaged after Nate's passage to the west of Pascagoula.

About 85 pct of U.S. Gulf oil output offline due to Nate - agency - Reuters News

{{20171009T181111.232+0000}}About 85 pct of U.S. Gulf oil output offline due to Nate - agencyHOUSTON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - About 85 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil production is offline in the aftermath of Hurricane Nate, the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) said on Monday.

That equals about 1.49 million barrels per day in production that is offline, according to BSEE. Oil companies evacuated staff from Gulf platforms and curtailed output ahead of the storm, which hit the region last weekend.

About 65 percent of Gulf natural gas production remains offline, BSEE said.

Chevron, Total interested in Majnoon oilfield -Iraq oil minister - Reuters Gulf Financial News

{{20171009T131212.789+0000}}Chevron, Total interested in Majnoon oilfield -Iraq oil ministerIRAQ-OIL/MAJNOON (URGENT):Chevron, Total interested in Majnoon oilfield -Iraq oil minister

BAGHDAD, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Iraqi oil minister Jabar al-Luaibi said on Monday that Chevron and Total are among the companies that have expressed interest in developing the Majnoon oilfield that Shell has said it wants to leave.

Royal Dutch Shell said last month it had agreed with Iraq's oil ministry to relinquish operations at the Majnoon field to the government after unfavourable changes to fiscal terms. The announcement confirmed an earlier Reuters report.

Luaibi said Baghdad has not started negotiations with other international oil companies on Shell's stake in the oilfield, as there has been no final decision taken on Shell's plan to exit the field.

Negotiations with Shell are ongoing, Luaibi said, adding he hoped to "reach a satisfactory deal for both parties". (Reporting by Ahmed Rasheed; writing by Rania El Gamal; editing by Jason Neely)Copyright (c) 2017 Thomson Reuters

Sonangol aims to slash oil production costs with board revamp  - Reuters News

{{20171009T114635.834+0000}}Sonangol aims to slash oil production costs with board revamp By Libby George

LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Angola's state oil company Sonangol is aiming to slash breakeven costs on new oil production to as low as $20-$30 per barrel and make its contracts more attractive to investors and oil and gas companies, the company's chief Isabel dos Santos told Reuters.

On the sidelines of the FT Africa Summit in London, dos Santos said changes to the Sonangol board announced last week would help the company revamp new exploration and production agreements and significantly cut costs.

"We are rethinking all our strategy, with a view of being able to produce barrels within $40-$50 per barrel," said dos Santos, the billionaire daughter of Angola's President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.

She said some projects were targeting a breakeven as low as $20-$30 per barrel, adding the changes were essential so new concession agreements could begin "delivering dollars per barrel, rather than just cost."

"In the past, we had investments that were quite heavy, quite capex heavy. That leaves us with a portfolio with barrels over $70, over $80, so we have some issues with some fields," dos Santos said.

Sonangol has been trying since the recent slump in oil prices to reduce costs and attract investment, but dos Santos said bringing in new talent, particularly people with experience at multinational companies and oil majors, could deliver further results.

In a statement on Friday, Sonangol said it had saved $1.7 billion thanks to spending cuts since 2014. But it also said it had replaced the chairman of its executive committee, Paulino Jeronimo, who had managed new concessions and relationships with operators. [nL8N1MH4Y0]

The company said the functions would now be carried out by two managers who could enable "the faster treatment of the challenges of the sector."

Earlier in the week, it appointed three new board members to help restructure the company, including former ExxonMobil executive Ivan Sá de Almeida, who used to work for Sonangol. [nL8N1MA1PP]

"We are redrawing our terms and conditions to make them more attractive," dos Santos said, adding that under the previously designed contracts, "the level of commitment (for companies) was not attractive."

Sonangol in May cancelled an auction of oil exploration licences for eight blocks, saying the drop in oil prices since the bidding opened had made the terms uneconomic. [nL8N1IK4AI]

Dos Santos said Sonangol had recruited new talent at other levels as well, and had thus far brought in roughly 26 people "on the first and second layers of governance," including from oil companies such as Chevron and Total, and it was still "looking at different multinationals that had Angolan talent."

Chevron, Total interested in Majnoon oilfield -Iraq oil minister  - Reuters News

{{20171009T103030.249+0000}}Chevron, Total interested in Majnoon oilfield -Iraq oil minister BAGHDAD, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Iraqi oil minister Jabar al-Luaibi said on Monday that Chevron and Total are among the companies that have expressed interest in developing the Majnoon oilfield that Shell has said it wants to leave.

Royal Dutch Shell said last month it had agreed with Iraq's oil ministry to relinquish operations at the Majnoon field to the government after unfavourable changes to fiscal terms. The announcement confirmed an earlier Reuters report. [nL5N1LU2NZ]

Luaibi said Baghdad has not started negotiations with other international oil companies on Shell's stake in the oilfield, as there has been no final decision taken on Shell's plan to exit the field.

Negotiations with Shell are ongoing, Luaibi said, adding he hoped to "reach a satisfactory deal for both parties".

UPDATE 3-Chevron starts LNG output at Australia's Wheatstone, first cargo expected in weeks - Reuters News

{{20171009T074405.710+0000}}UPDATE 3-Chevron starts LNG output at Australia's Wheatstone, first cargo expected in weeks* Wheatstone had been due to start shipping in mid-2017

By Sonali Paul and Henning Gloystein

MELBOURNE/SINGAPORE, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp said on Monday it has started producing liquefied natural gas (LNG) at its Wheatstone project in Australia, slightly later than expected, and plans to ship its first cargo soon.

The LNG market will be focused on how smoothly Wheatstone progresses following the troubled start-up at Chevron's bigger Gorgon LNG project. Both projects are fed from natural gas fields offshore the state of Western Australia.

"The first cargo is on track to be shipped in the coming weeks," Chevron Corp said in a statement. It had originally hoped to start exporting from Wheatstone in the middle of 2017.

Wheatstone is the sixth out of eight projects in a $200 billion Australian LNG construction boom that is now in its final stretch. The two remaining ones are Royal Dutch Shell's Prelude floating LNG project and Ichthys, led by Japan's Inpex <1605.T>. [nL4N1LO1H5]

This massive expansion, which has suffered numerous delays, has propelled Australia past Malaysia to become the world's second-biggest LNG exporter. Once all the mega-projects are completed, Australia will challenge Qatar for the top spot. [nL4N1MG0X9]

WHEATSTONE TO WEIGH ON LNG PRICES

Wheatstone, co-owned by Australia's Woodside Petroleum , Kuwait Foreign Exploration Co and Japan's Kyushu Electric Power Co <9508.T>, has two gas liquefaction units, which at full capacity will supply 8.9 million metric tonnes of LNG a year to customers in Asia.

The company expects the second unit to start producing six to eight months after the first.

Woodside has been closely involved in Wheatstone, looking to ensure smooth development, as the company expects the project to be the largest contributor to its planned 15 percent production growth over the next three years.

"Wheatstone is a world-class asset and the safe start-up of the facility was one of our priorities for 2017, supporting our near-term growth strategy," Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman said.

Wheatstone exports could stall rising spot LNG prices , which have surged 55 percent since March to $8.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) on strong demand and the delayed ramp-up of many of the Australian LNG export facilities. [nL4N1MH0LA]

"It (Wheatstone) comes at just the right time ahead of winter...Together with Wheatstone, several new LNG trains such as Yamal LNG, Cove Point and Train 4 from Sabine Pass will ramp up or start up production by year-end," said Nicholas Browne, head of Asia gas and power research at Wood Mackenzie in Singapore.

"This will sow the seeds for strong production through winter 2017-18, pushing the market into increasing over-capacity as we move into the summer of 2018. We therefore expect to see prices dip below $6/mmbtu once this winter is over," said Browne.

UPDATE 3-U.S. oil ports, refiners and producers plan reopenings after Nate - Reuters News

{{20171008T231048.524+0000}}UPDATE 3-U.S. oil ports, refiners and producers plan reopenings after Nate(Adds status of platforms, Chalmette refinery, New Orleans port)

By Marianna Parraga and Rod Nickel

HOUSTON/MOBILE, Ala., Oct 8 (Reuters) - Some oil ports, producers and refiners in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama that shut facilities ahead of Hurricane Nate were planning reopenings as the storm moved inland on Sunday, away from most energy infrastructure on the U.S. Gulf Coast.

The storm, which weakened to a tropical depression and was moving inland toward Alabama and Tennessee, killed 30 people in Central America before speeding across the central U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where more than 90 percent of oil output remained shut. [nL2N1MJ057]

Oil producers Chevron Corp and Royal Dutch Shell began on Sunday to redeploy personnel, assess facilities and restore oil output in the Gulf of Mexico, including platforms, pipelines and terminals shut ahead of Nate, the companies said in statements. [nL2N1MJ0KL]

Chevron also said it was assessing the impact of Nate on its 340,000-barrel-per-day Pascagoula refinery in Mississippi. [nL2N1MJ0ER][nL2N1MJ0CM]

About eight flares and limited steam were visible on Sunday at Chevron's refinery, indicating activity. Energy intelligence service Genscape said Chevron shut the facility on Saturday, but the company did not confirm the information.

Nate has forced the closure of more than triple the volume of Gulf offshore crude production than Hurricane Harvey did from late August to early September, with 92.6 percent of total oil output shut, according to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE). [nL2N1MJ0FF]

About 1.62 million bpd of oil and 2.5 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas output remained offline on Sunday at 298 evacuated offshore platforms, almost unchanged from Saturday, the BSEE said.

Vessel traffic and port operations at New Orleans resumed on Sunday afternoon, the U.S. Coast Guard said. "New Orleans has reopened all waterways without restrictions," it said in a statement where it also warned about shoaling, storm debris, and other hazards that may exist after the storm.

In Alabama, the port of Mobile remained closed on Sunday and no estimated reopening date had been officially set, although no damage to the terminal and port had been reported, said Mike Forister, assistant terminal manager at Arc Terminals.

Forester said it was not much of a setback "because we are getting down to slower season," he said.

Mobile's navigation channel could remain shut until Tuesday because of rough conditions, said Mike Buckley, operations manager at Alabama Bulk Terminal Company, whose facilities did not sustain damage.

About 18 oil tankers were sheltered on Sunday along the Mississippi River near New Orleans, half of them loaded with crude or refined products. Several container ships and cruise ships were also waiting for the port to allow disembarking.

In Mobile, two tankers were near the port, according to the Reuters data.

REFINERIES SAFE

Phillips 66's 247,000-bpd Alliance refinery and Valero's 125,000-bpd Meraux refinery, both in Louisiana, were reported undamaged after the passage of Nate, said sources familiar with their operations. [nL2N1MJ0BY][nL2N1MJ09X]

Alliance planned to restart some units on Sunday but may not resume production until midweek because of the limited availability of crude oil at the U.S. Gulf, the sources said.

Phillips 66 said it had no update on the status of the refinery on Sunday morning. Valero did not respond to a request for comment about Meraux, which was not shut during the storm.

PBF Energy Inc's Chalmette refinery in Louisiana was operating on Sunday, according to sources. The company declined to comment. [nL2N1MJ0KS]

{{20171008T230259.046+0000}}FACTBOX-U.S. Gulf of Mexico energy facilities down from Hurricane Nate(Adds facilities shutting and restarting)

HOUSTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas producers in the
Gulf of Mexico have started assessing offshore facilities to
resume operations as storm Nate, which was downgraded on Sunday
to a tropical depression, moved inland.

Workers at some of the almost 300 production platforms and
rigs shut during the storm were returning on Sunday, according
to several oil operators. [nL2N1MJ0EA]

But 1.62 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil production and
2.5 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas output remained
offline on Sunday, almost unchanged from Saturday, according to
the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE).

Energy companies that halted some operations and pulled
workers ahead of Nate off platforms included BP Plc ,
Exxon Mobil Corp , Chevron Corp , ConocoPhillips
, Royal Dutch Shell Plc , Anadarko Petroleum Corp
 and BHP Billiton Ltd  . [nL1N1BA1D4]

The U.S. Coast Guard on Sunday allowed the Port of New
Orleans in Louisiana to resume some vessel traffic, while the
Port of Mobile, in Alabama, remained shut to inbound and
outbound traffic.

Nate made its initial U.S. landfall near the mouth of the
Mississippi river on Saturday and then made a second landfall
near Biloxi, Mississippi, early on Sunday. [nL2N1MJ057]

HOUSTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp said it was assessing the impact of Hurricane Nate on its 340,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery on Sunday.

The company also said it continues to supply its customers after the hurricane's passage.

Energy industry intelligence service Genscape said Chevron shut the Pascagoula refinery on Saturday before Nate came ashore. Chevron has not confirmed the Genscape report.

A Reuters eyewitness said the refinery appeared undamaged and had electricity and steam on Sunday afternoon. Both are necessary to the refining process.

Several flares were operational, but only two appeared to burn off product, according to the Reuters eyewitness.

HOUSTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Oil ports and some refineries in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama were assessing their facilities on Sunday to decide when they could reopen after Hurricane Nate made landfall on Saturday night near the mouth of the Mississippi river.

More than 1.6 million bpd of oil and 2.48 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas output remained shut on Saturday after more than 300 offshore platforms were evacuated.

The status of PBF Energy Inc's Chalmette refinery in Louisiana and Chevron Corp's Pascagoula refinery in Mississippi is unclear. The companies did not respond to requests for comment on their operations.

As of Sunday morning, the ports of New Orleans in Louisiana and Mobile in Alabama remained closed to inbound and outbound vessel traffic, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.

"Post-storm assessments are planned for today to decide further action," a Coast Guard spokeswoman said.

About 18 oil tankers were sheltered along the Mississippi River near New Orleans, half of them loaded with crude or refined products, as port authorities established a safety zone until Sunday night to protect vessels from hazards from severe weather, according to Reuters vessel tracking data.

UPDATE 3-More U.S. Gulf oil producers halt output ahead of Tropical Storm Nate - 路透新闻

{{20171006T224021.302+0000}}UPDATE 3-More U.S. Gulf oil producers halt output ahead of Tropical Storm Nate(New throughout, updates storm status and adds more companies halting operations)

By Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Nearly three-quarters of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil production was offline ahead of Tropical Storm Nate, and more oil companies were halting operations late Friday, bracing for the second major storm in as many months to menace the region.

Nate was about 80 miles (125 km) east of Cozumel Mexico and moving at 21 miles per hour (34 kph) late Friday afternoon. It was expected to strike the U.S. Gulf Coast Saturday with hurricane force winds and rain, according to the National Hurricane Center.[nEMN10R9RA]

Its path takes it right through the most-active oil-producing region of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Nate has shuttered nearly three times as much Gulf crude production as Hurricane Harvey did in August. At its height, Harvey shut-in only about 25 percent of the region's oil production.[nNDL96HrMT]

Anadarko Petroleum late Friday said it shut in five more offshore facilities and was removing all their workers. BHP Billiton also said it evacuated two platforms.

BP , Exxon Mobil , Chevron and ConocoPhillips also withdrew staff and curtailed output. Government data showed oil companies evacuated 66 platforms and took 1.24 million barrels of oil per day offline since Thursday. [nL2N1MH1F7]

Nate was expected to cut U.S. exports of crude oil and boost refining margins given low stockpiles of gasoline and other refined products, brokerage Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients.

Oil prices dropped nearly 3 percent on Friday despite the storm, on concerns about global oversupply and profit taking.[O/R]

ConocoPhillips began evacuating non-essential personnel from its Magnolia oil platform, Exxon evacuated staff at its Mobile Bay and Lena platforms.[nL2N1MG20M][nL2N1MH1M2]

Chevron shut its 4,100-mile (6,598 km) pipeline subsidiary, saying it would not accept or deliver crude until after Nate subsided. [nL2N1MH1BR]

Matt Rogers, meteorologist at Commodity Weather Group, said the rapid speed of the storm could keep it from becoming more than a Category 1 hurricane, producing up to 80 mile per hour (129 kph) winds.

"In our view it is not going to be strong enough to do damage" to offshore production facilities, he said. "Usually when storms move this quickly they have troubles developing," he said.

The U.S. Coast Guard declared condition "X-Ray" at the port of New Orleans ahead of Nate, which means gale force winds could come within 48 hours. Commercial vessels and large barges must report to the Coast Guard to decide whether to depart or remain.

Parts of the Mississippi River, which flows past New Orleans and is a major transit hub for oil and other commodities, have been closed to inbound deep draft vessels.

The region's oil refineries are still recovering from Harvey, which shut production at some plants for weeks. Producers also curtailed some production but quickly resumed output.

Royal Dutch Shell Plc decided against cutting operations at its 225,800 barrel-per-day (bpd) Norco, Louisiana, refinery, reversing an earlier decision.[nL2N1MH1C1]

Shell did, though, close production at three oil-producing hubs in the eastern Gulf.[nFWN1MH0DP]

Phillips 66 was shutting down its 247,000 bpd Alliance, Louisiana, refinery, 25 miles (40 km) south of New Orleans, as a precaution. [nL2N1MH01Y]

Commodity Weather forecast Nate to bring moderate rainfall when it makes landfall somewhere west of Mobile Bay, Alabama, and east of New Orleans, Louisiana. It expects between 4 inches and 6 inches (10-15 centimeters) of rain to fall in the path of the storm.

The U.S. Gulf of Mexico is home to about 17 percent of U.S. crude output and 5 percent of dry natural gas output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. More than 45 percent of U.S. refining capacity is along the Gulf Coast.

{{20171006T181238.408+0000}}About 71.1 pct Of U.S. Gulf oil output offline ahead of Nate -BSEEHOUSTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - About 71 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil production is offline ahead of Tropical Storm Nate, the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) said on Friday.

Nate is forecast to enter the Gulf and strengthen into a hurricane before making landfall late Saturday in Louisiana, near several major refineries. [nL2N1MH0SN]

Oil companies have evacuated staff from Gulf platforms and curtailed output ahead of the storm, with production equaling 1.24 million barrels of crude per day already offline, according to BSEE. [nL2N1MH1D5]

About 53.2 percent of Gulf natural gas production remains offline, BSEE said.

By Julia Payne and Zandi Shabalala

LONDON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Commodities trader and miner Glencore has swooped in to replace China's Sinopec as the buyer of Chevron's South African and Botswana assets after reaching a deal with local investors.

The assets include a 100,000 barrel-per-day oil refinery in Cape Town, a lubricants plant in Durban as well as 820 petrol stations and other oil storage facilities. It also includes 220 convenience stores across South Africa and Botswana.

In its statement on Friday, Glencore said it had agreed to buy Chevron's 75 percent stake in its South African subsidiary and its Botswana interests for a combined $973 million. The remaining 25 percent stake will stay with a consortium of Black Economic Empowerment shareholders and an employee trust.

An industry source familiar with Glencore's mergers and acquisitions activities said the company was looking to bring in a partner.

A spokesman for Chevron said the company does not comment on commercial matters. Sinopec did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Glencore stepped in after local shareholders exercised pre-emption rights following delays to the Sinopec deal.

In March, Chevron announced that it had agreed the sale of its assets to China's largest refiner Sinopec <600028.SS>, <0386.HK> for nearly $1 billion. As of May, the deal had been under review by South Africa's Economic Development ministry. [nL3N1GZ3PH][nL8N1IR3QG]

Glencore was among the bidders for the stake last year along with oil major Total and rival trading house Gunvor. [nL8N1CU16Z]

END OF ERA

The stake was of keen interest to many oil traders as the retail network is one of the biggest in South Africa and it provides access to strategic storage in Saldanha Bay on the southwestern coast.

Chevron along with other oil majors have announced a flurry of downstream sales in the last few years to trim costs after global oil prices slumped in 2014.

Chevron, which has had a presence in South Africa for more than a century, announced the sale in January 2016.

Nimbler oil trading firms have snapped up the unwanted oil refineries and retail stations particularly in industrialising nations such as South Africa where young populations and a fast-growing middle class are expected to boost fuel demand. [nL5N1GN28P]

Glencore has shifted in the last year from shedding interests during the 2015-2016 commodities downturn to asset-buying since the rebound in prices. [nL5N1KM2XJ]

The deal, which will include Glencore retaining Chevron's local management team and workforce, will be funded using existing cash resources and is expected to close in mid-2018.

"Glencore intends to manage its overall oil asset portfolio to ensure that, including this transaction, net additional capital investment is limited to less than $500 million over the next 12 months," it said.

If the deal closes, this would be Glencore's first refining asset. It began expanding into downstream oil in May after setting up a retail franchise in Mexico. [nL8N1IK1R8]

Chevron says pipeline unit will stop accepting crude ahead of Nate - 路透新闻

{{20171006T173611.466+0000}}Chevron says pipeline unit will stop accepting crude ahead of NateHOUSTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp said on Friday its pipeline subsidiary will not accept or deliver crude oil until after Tropical Storm Nate.

Chevron Pipe Line Co has a network of 4,100 miles (6,598 km)of pipe that moves more than 1.3 million barrels of crude, refined products and chemicals.

Chevron on Thursday had already stopped all oil and natural gas production at its offshore platforms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico ahead of Nate, which is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane before making landfall late Saturday in Louisiana, near several major refineries.[nL2N1MG234][nL2N1MH14B]

California AG pledges to defend birth control insurance coverage - Reuters News

{{20171006T155854.628+0000}}California AG pledges to defend birth control insurance coverageSAN FRANCISCO, Oct 6 (Reuters) - California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said on Friday he was "prepared to take whatever action it takes" to defend the Obamacare mandate that health insurers provide birth control, now that the Trump administration has moved to circumvent it.

The administration's new contraception exemptions "are another example of the Trump administration trampling on people's rights, but in this case only women," Becerra told Reuters.

Becerra and other Democratic attorneys general have filed courtroom challenges to other Trump administration policies involving healthcare, immigration and the environment.

U.S. Gulf refiners, ports assess facilities after Nate - Reuters News

{{20171008T163317.722+0000}}U.S. Gulf refiners, ports assess facilities after NateBy Marianna Parraga and Erwin Seba

HOUSTON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Oil ports and some refineries in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama were assessing their facilities on Sunday to decide when they could reopen after Hurricane Nate made landfall on Saturday night near the mouth of the Mississippi river.

The storm, which weakened on Sunday to a tropical depression and was moving inland toward the Tennessee Valley and Central Appalachian Mountains, killed 30 people in Central America before speeding across the central U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where more than 90 percent of oil output remained shut on Saturday. [nL2N1MJ057]

Phillips 66's 247,000-barrel-per day Alliance refinery and Valero's 125,000 bpd Meraux refinery, both in Louisiana, were reported undamaged after the passage of Nate, according to sources familiar with their operations. [nL2N1MJ0BY] [nL2N1MJ09X]

Alliance may restart some units on Sunday but may not resume production until midweek because of the limited availability of crude oil at the U.S. Gulf, the sources said.

A Phillips 66 spokesman said the firm had no update on the status of the refinery on Sunday morning. Valero did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Nate forced the closure of more than triple the volume of Gulf offshore crude production than Hurricane Harvey did from late August to early September, according to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. More than 1.6 million bpd of oil and 2.48 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas output remained shut on Saturday after more than 300 offshore platforms were evacuated.

The status of PBF Energy Inc's Chalmette refinery in Louisiana and Chevron Corp's Pascagoula refinery in Mississippi is unclear. The companies did not respond to requests for comment on their operations.

As of Sunday morning, the ports of New Orleans in Louisiana and Mobile in Alabama remained closed to inbound and outbound vessel traffic, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.

"Post-storm assessments are planned for today to decide further action," a Coast Guard spokeswoman said.

About 18 oil tankers were sheltered along the Mississippi River near New Orleans, half of them loaded with crude or refined products, as port authorities established a safety zone until Sunday night to protect vessels from hazards from severe weather, according to Reuters vessel tracking data.

In Mobile, Alabama, two tankers were near the port, according to the Reuters data.

UPDATE 3-More U.S. Gulf oil producers halt output ahead of Tropical Storm Nate - 路透新闻

{{20171006T224021.302+0000}}UPDATE 3-More U.S. Gulf oil producers halt output ahead of Tropical Storm Nate(New throughout, updates storm status and adds more companies halting operations)

By Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Nearly three-quarters of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil production was offline ahead of Tropical Storm Nate, and more oil companies were halting operations late Friday, bracing for the second major storm in as many months to menace the region.

Nate was about 80 miles (125 km) east of Cozumel Mexico and moving at 21 miles per hour (34 kph) late Friday afternoon. It was expected to strike the U.S. Gulf Coast Saturday with hurricane force winds and rain, according to the National Hurricane Center.[nEMN10R9RA]

Its path takes it right through the most-active oil-producing region of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Nate has shuttered nearly three times as much Gulf crude production as Hurricane Harvey did in August. At its height, Harvey shut-in only about 25 percent of the region's oil production.[nNDL96HrMT]

Anadarko Petroleum late Friday said it shut in five more offshore facilities and was removing all their workers. BHP Billiton also said it evacuated two platforms.

BP , Exxon Mobil , Chevron and ConocoPhillips also withdrew staff and curtailed output. Government data showed oil companies evacuated 66 platforms and took 1.24 million barrels of oil per day offline since Thursday. [nL2N1MH1F7]

Nate was expected to cut U.S. exports of crude oil and boost refining margins given low stockpiles of gasoline and other refined products, brokerage Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients.

Oil prices dropped nearly 3 percent on Friday despite the storm, on concerns about global oversupply and profit taking.[O/R]

ConocoPhillips began evacuating non-essential personnel from its Magnolia oil platform, Exxon evacuated staff at its Mobile Bay and Lena platforms.[nL2N1MG20M][nL2N1MH1M2]

Chevron shut its 4,100-mile (6,598 km) pipeline subsidiary, saying it would not accept or deliver crude until after Nate subsided. [nL2N1MH1BR]

Matt Rogers, meteorologist at Commodity Weather Group, said the rapid speed of the storm could keep it from becoming more than a Category 1 hurricane, producing up to 80 mile per hour (129 kph) winds.

"In our view it is not going to be strong enough to do damage" to offshore production facilities, he said. "Usually when storms move this quickly they have troubles developing," he said.

The U.S. Coast Guard declared condition "X-Ray" at the port of New Orleans ahead of Nate, which means gale force winds could come within 48 hours. Commercial vessels and large barges must report to the Coast Guard to decide whether to depart or remain.

Parts of the Mississippi River, which flows past New Orleans and is a major transit hub for oil and other commodities, have been closed to inbound deep draft vessels.

The region's oil refineries are still recovering from Harvey, which shut production at some plants for weeks. Producers also curtailed some production but quickly resumed output.

Royal Dutch Shell Plc decided against cutting operations at its 225,800 barrel-per-day (bpd) Norco, Louisiana, refinery, reversing an earlier decision.[nL2N1MH1C1]

Shell did, though, close production at three oil-producing hubs in the eastern Gulf.[nFWN1MH0DP]

Phillips 66 was shutting down its 247,000 bpd Alliance, Louisiana, refinery, 25 miles (40 km) south of New Orleans, as a precaution. [nL2N1MH01Y]

Commodity Weather forecast Nate to bring moderate rainfall when it makes landfall somewhere west of Mobile Bay, Alabama, and east of New Orleans, Louisiana. It expects between 4 inches and 6 inches (10-15 centimeters) of rain to fall in the path of the storm.

The U.S. Gulf of Mexico is home to about 17 percent of U.S. crude output and 5 percent of dry natural gas output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. More than 45 percent of U.S. refining capacity is along the Gulf Coast.

About 71.1 pct Of U.S. Gulf oil output offline ahead of Nate -BSEE - Reuters News

{{20171006T181238.408+0000}}About 71.1 pct Of U.S. Gulf oil output offline ahead of Nate -BSEEHOUSTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - About 71 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil production is offline ahead of Tropical Storm Nate, the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) said on Friday.

Nate is forecast to enter the Gulf and strengthen into a hurricane before making landfall late Saturday in Louisiana, near several major refineries. [nL2N1MH0SN]

Oil companies have evacuated staff from Gulf platforms and curtailed output ahead of the storm, with production equaling 1.24 million barrels of crude per day already offline, according to BSEE. [nL2N1MH1D5]

About 53.2 percent of Gulf natural gas production remains offline, BSEE said.

UPDATE 3-Glencore pips Sinopec to buy Chevron's South African assets - Reuters News

* Chevron's assets include major refinery in Cape Town

* Chevron previously agreed sale with China's Sinopec

* Glencore looking to bring in partner for the stake - source

(Adds Chevron comment in par 4)

By Julia Payne and Zandi Shabalala

LONDON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Commodities trader and miner Glencore has swooped in to replace China's Sinopec as the buyer of Chevron's South African and Botswana assets after reaching a deal with local investors.

The assets include a 100,000 barrel-per-day oil refinery in Cape Town, a lubricants plant in Durban as well as 820 petrol stations and other oil storage facilities. It also includes 220 convenience stores across South Africa and Botswana.

In its statement on Friday, Glencore said it had agreed to buy Chevron's 75 percent stake in its South African subsidiary and its Botswana interests for a combined $973 million. The remaining 25 percent stake will stay with a consortium of Black Economic Empowerment shareholders and an employee trust.

An industry source familiar with Glencore's mergers and acquisitions activities said the company was looking to bring in a partner.

A spokesman for Chevron said the company does not comment on commercial matters. Sinopec did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Glencore stepped in after local shareholders exercised pre-emption rights following delays to the Sinopec deal.

In March, Chevron announced that it had agreed the sale of its assets to China's largest refiner Sinopec <600028.SS>, <0386.HK> for nearly $1 billion. As of May, the deal had been under review by South Africa's Economic Development ministry. [nL3N1GZ3PH][nL8N1IR3QG]

Glencore was among the bidders for the stake last year along with oil major Total and rival trading house Gunvor. [nL8N1CU16Z]

END OF ERA

The stake was of keen interest to many oil traders as the retail network is one of the biggest in South Africa and it provides access to strategic storage in Saldanha Bay on the southwestern coast.

Chevron along with other oil majors have announced a flurry of downstream sales in the last few years to trim costs after global oil prices slumped in 2014.

Chevron, which has had a presence in South Africa for more than a century, announced the sale in January 2016.

Nimbler oil trading firms have snapped up the unwanted oil refineries and retail stations particularly in industrialising nations such as South Africa where young populations and a fast-growing middle class are expected to boost fuel demand. [nL5N1GN28P]

Glencore has shifted in the last year from shedding interests during the 2015-2016 commodities downturn to asset-buying since the rebound in prices. [nL5N1KM2XJ]

The deal, which will include Glencore retaining Chevron's local management team and workforce, will be funded using existing cash resources and is expected to close in mid-2018.

"Glencore intends to manage its overall oil asset portfolio to ensure that, including this transaction, net additional capital investment is limited to less than $500 million over the next 12 months," it said.

If the deal closes, this would be Glencore's first refining asset. It began expanding into downstream oil in May after setting up a retail franchise in Mexico. [nL8N1IK1R8]

California AG pledges to defend birth control insurance coverage - Reuters News

{{20171006T155854.628+0000}}California AG pledges to defend birth control insurance coverageSAN FRANCISCO, Oct 6 (Reuters) - California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said on Friday he was "prepared to take whatever action it takes" to defend the Obamacare mandate that health insurers provide birth control, now that the Trump administration has moved to circumvent it.

The administration's new contraception exemptions "are another example of the Trump administration trampling on people's rights, but in this case only women," Becerra told Reuters.

Becerra and other Democratic attorneys general have filed courtroom challenges to other Trump administration policies involving healthcare, immigration and the environment.

Australia closing in on Qatar as world's top LNG exporter - Reuters News

{{20171005T130001.144+0000}}Australia closing in on Qatar as world's top LNG exporter* Australia LNG exports tipped to rise to 74 mt in 2018-19

* Australia's share of Japan, Korea LNG imports seen growing

* Iron ore price forecast raised to $64 for 2017

SYDNEY, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Australia expects to increase exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) by 16 percent from mid-2018 as $180 billion in new projects hit their stride, nearly catching up with Qatar, the world's top supplier.

Rising LNG exports coupled with higher prices for steel-making commodities and thermal coal should see Australia's overall resource and energy export earnings increase 2 percent in the year to end-June 2018, to a record A$211 billion ($165 billion), the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science said on Friday.

Australia's LNG exports are forecast to climb to 74 million tonnes in the year to end-June 2019, from 63.8 million tonnes forecast for this year and 52 million tonnes last year.

By comparison, Qatar last year exported 77.6 million tonnes.

The rise in Australian exports will be underpinned by higher output at the Gorgon project, run by Chevron Corp , as well as the completion of three remaining LNG projects: Chevron's Wheatstone, Inpex Corp's <1605.T> Ichthys, and Royal Dutch Shell's Prelude.

Those three projects will add around 21 million tonnes to Australia's LNG export capacity, taking total capacity to around 88 million tonnes.

Japan, South Korea and China are set to absorb the extra volumes, the department said in its quarterly commodities report.

"While prospects for growth in the imports of Japan and South Korea are limited, Australian producers are expected to capture an increasing share of both country's imports," the department said.

The department raised its iron ore price forecast for 2017 about 3 percent to an average $64 a tonne, and increased its coking coal price forecast by 6 percent to $203.30 a tonne from its June outlook.

Coking coal contract prices for the third and fourth quarters are forecast to be much lower than the first half, it said, driven by higher production in China and a return to normal in Australia after a cyclone cut output earlier this year.

Iron ore, Australia's top export earner and dominated by miners Rio Tinto and BHP , has rebounded from a low of $47 a tonne in mid-June, to average $65 a tonne in the September quarter.

"The iron ore price has been boosted by strong steel margins in China, which has resulted in increased steel production and mill restocking of inputs," the department said.

Forecast exports of iron ore were decreased slightly to 862.3 million tonnes in 2017-18 and to 886.7 million the following year. ($1 = 1.2773 Australian dollars)

Venezuela's U.S. crude sales hit 14-yr low in Sept on sanctions, port closures - Reuters News

{{20171003T205931.473+0000}}Venezuela's U.S. crude sales hit 14-yr low in Sept on sanctions, port closuresHOUSTON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Sales of Venezuelan crude to the United States fell to a 14-year low in September, according to Thomson Reuters Trade Flows data, on U.S. Gulf Coast ports closures due to Hurricane Harvey and sanctions.

Venezuela's oil output dropped this year to its lowest point in almost three decades, hurting exports to its main customers. Shipments to the United States have also been hit by U.S. sanctions on Venezuela's state oil company, PDVSA, in August.

The United States received 30 cargoes of Venezuelan crude in September, from 38 the previous month. Volumes fell to 488,165 barrels per day, down 24 percent from August levels and a 38-percent fall compared with the same month of 2016, according to the Reuters data.

Venezuela does not publicly release monthly oil export figures.

Petroleos de Venezuela's U.S. refining arm, Citgo Petroleum, was the largest recipient of Venezuelan crude last month, followed by Valero Energy .

Phillips 66 and Chevron Corp imported less Venezuelan oil in September compared with August, the figures showed.

Several cargoes of Venezuelan crude had to be lightered as most Texas ports operated in September under draft restrictions, banning fully loaded Aframax tankers from using the navigation channels due to damage caused by Hurricane Harvey, according to the data and port authorities.

Venezuela also shipped to the United States some crude grades that typically are exported to other destinations, including a cargo of Santa Barbara light crude bought by trading firm Trafigura [TRAFG.UL] and another of Pedernales heavy crude imported by Citgo.

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration in August imposed sanctions intended to disrupt PDVSA and the Venezuelan government's ability to raise new debt, and banned Citgo from transferring dividends or other profits to its parent company. [nL2N1LB12B]

Even though most commercial trade was exempted from the sanctions, some U.S. importers of Venezuelan oil have struggled to get the letters of credit needed to complete certain purchases.

The Department of Treasury said on Tuesday payments by U.S. persons to the Venezuelan government and PDVSA for goods and services, taxes and royalties, as well as payments to holders of Venezuelan bonds are excluded from sanctions.

Thailand again delays auction of Erawan, Bongkot gas fields - Reuters News

{{20171002T085941.445+0000}}Thailand again delays auction of Erawan, Bongkot gas fieldsBANGKOK, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Thailand will delay the auctions of the concessions for the Erawan and Bongkot gas fields for at least another month and expects to announce winners in the middle of next year, a senior official said on Monday.

Chevron Corp operates the Erawan field and state-owned PTT Exploration and Production operates the Bongot field under licences set to expire in 2022 and 2023 respectively.

The fields have combined output of 2.2 billion cubic feet a day, about 76 percent of output from the Gulf of Thailand.

Mubadala Petroleum and Mitsui Oil Exploration (Moeco) are interested in bidding, Veerasak Pungrassamee, director-general of the mineral fuels department, told reporters.

Thai energy firms, Bangchak Corporation and Palang Sophon Ltd. were also invited to bid.

"The council of state is reviewing the production-sharing contract (PSC) law that will be used for the Erawan and Bongkot fields and should conclude within one to two months," Veerasak added.

Bidding will begin after the cabinet approves the law and auction terms, with winning bids expected to be announced six or seven months after the auction in the middle of 2018, he added.

In September, the energy ministry said the auction would begin in November and winning bids announced in April next year. [nL4N1LV3Z8]
