UPDATE 1-Chevron, Angola government in tax, investment talks - 路透新闻

{{20170222T110141.546+0000}}UPDATE 1-Chevron, Angola government in tax, investment talks(Adds details)

LUANDA, Feb 22 (Reuters) - U.S. energy company Chevron is in talks with the Angolan government and state oil firm Sonangol to revise tax terms and any future investment will hinge on those talks, a senior company official was quoted as saying on Wednesday.

"Existing tax terms are not very attractive ... We have been working both with Sonangol and with various departments of the government of Angola so that we can make it feasible and we can invest. Our investment will depend on what will result from these negotiations," Chevron Vice-president Jay Johnson was quoted as saying on state radio.

Africa's second largest crude producer and third largest economy has been laid low by depressed prices for oil, which accounts for about 90 percent of government revenue.

Angola's economy contracted 4.3 percent in the third quarter of 2016 after shrinking 7.8 percent in the second quarter, the National Institute of Statistics said this month, a sharp reversal from double-digit growth when oil prices were high.

The economic backdrop could set the stage for tough tax talks as Angola's government needs revenue while large oil companies are trying to turn a profit in a difficult price environment.

Johnson was also quoted as saying that recent output cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) - of which Angola is a member - had not affected Chevron's production levels in the southern African country.

By Chen Aizhu and Ruma Paul

BEIJING/DHAKA, Feb 22 (Reuters) - China's state-run Zhenhua Oil has signed a preliminary deal with Chevron to buy the U.S. oil major's natural gas fields in Bangladesh that are worth about $2 billion, two Beijing-based Chinese oil executives said.

Zhenhua is a subsidiary of China's defence industry conglomerate NORINCO. A completed deal would mark China's first major energy investment in the South Asian country, where Beijing is competing with New Delhi and Tokyo for influence.

Bangladesh, though, holds the right of first refusal on the assets and could block the transaction. The country, via its national oil company Petrobangla, is keen to buy the gas fields and is talking to international banks to raise financing, according to a banking source familiar with the process.

Bangladesh is in the process of hiring global energy consultant Wood Mackenzie to assess the fields' reserves before placing a formal bid to buy the assets, two Bangladesh sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. [nL1N1D106W]

The Bangladesh sources said they were not aware of Zhenhua Oil's competing interest in the Chevron fields.

"As this project is in the process of commercial discussions, we can't comment based on our company policy," said Zhang Xiaodi, Zhenhua Oil's spokesman.

Zhenhua Oil is a small oil and gas explorer that despite its connections to China's defence industry is dwarfed in comparison to state energy giants PetroChina <0857.HK> and Sinopec <0386.HK>. It is trying to formalise its deal with Chevron by June, after the two companies signed a preliminary pact in January, the two senior oil executives told Reuters.

Zhenhua will partner with China Reform Holdings Corp Ltd, an investment vehicle under the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC). Zhenhua will hold 60 percent of the deal and China Reform 40 percent, the two executives said.

The executives declined to be named as these discussions were not public.

Chevron, in an e-mailed statement, confirmed that it was in commercial discussions on its Bangladesh assets, but would not comment further as a matter of policy.

Chevron had said in October 2015 that it planned to sell about $10 billion worth of assets by 2017 including geothermal projects in Indonesia and the Philippines and gas fields in Bangladesh amid a prolonged slump in energy prices.

Bangladesh knows that Chevron is in talk with global companies, but has no specific knowledge about Zhenhua's interest, said Nasrul Hamid, state minister for power, energy and mineral resources.

"This is Chevron's matter. We'll not interrupt but we are supposed to get the first priority," he said when asked if Bangladesh would try to block the China deal.

"We will place a formal bid only if the project is viable," Hamid said.

Chevron sells the entire output from its three gas fields - Bibiyana, Jalalabad and Moulavi Bazar, which account for more than half of Bangladesh's total gas output - to state energy firm Petrobangla under a production sharing contract.

ZHENHUA BEAT OUT CHINA RIVAL

With output and revenue slashed by low oil prices for the last nearly three years, China's state energy firms are under pressure to step up efforts to boost reserves and profits as Brent crude stabilizes around $55 a barrel.

Zhenhua Oil appears to have outrivaled competing bidders by partnering with the state investment vehicle China Reform, the Chinese executives said.

Geo-Jade Petroleum Corp <600759.SS>, an independent Chinese oil and gas explorer, was a close competitor with a bid at $2.3 billion, said one of the executives.

"Possibly because Zhenhua is a state-owned company and has the backing of China Reform, that's why it was picked by Chevron," said the executive.

Zhenhua Oil has oil and gas operations in Iraq, Kazakhstan, Syria, Myanmar and Egypt.

If the Bangladesh deal materializes, it would hand the Chinese firm 16 million tonnes a year of oil equivalent output, including natural gas and condensate, a scale that would make it China's fourth-largest oil and gas producer, the two Chinese executives said.

EXCLUSIVE-China state firm in preliminary deal to buy Chevron's Bangladesh gas fields -oil executives - 路透新闻

{{20170222T084306.261+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-China state firm in preliminary deal to buy Chevron's Bangladesh gas fields -oil executivesBy Chen Aizhu and Ruma Paul

BEIJING/DHAKA, Feb 22 (Reuters) - China's state-run Zhenhua Oil has signed a preliminary deal with Chevron to buy the U.S. oil major's natural gas fields in Bangladesh that are worth about $2 billion, two Beijing-based Chinese oil executives said.

Zhenhua is a subsidiary of China's defence industry conglomerate NORINCO. A completed deal would mark China's first major energy investment in the South Asian country, where Beijing is competing with New Delhi and Tokyo for influence.

Bangladesh, though, holds the right of first refusal on the assets and could block the transaction. The country, via its national oil company Petrobangla, is keen to buy the gas fields and is talking to international banks to raise financing, according to a banking source familiar with the process.

Bangladesh is in the process of hiring global energy consultant Wood Mackenzie to assess the fields' reserves before placing a formal bid to buy the assets, two Bangladesh sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. [nL4N1FK1M6]

The Bangladesh sources said they were not aware of Zhenhua Oil's competing interest in the Chevron fields.

Wall Street challenges U.S. regulator over proposed commodities rule - 路透新闻

{{20170221T174930.580+0000}}Wall Street challenges U.S. regulator over proposed commodities ruleBy Olivia Oran

Feb 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street is pushing back against a proposed rule to force U.S. banks like Goldman Sachs Group Inc to hold more capital against investments in commodities, placing what some see as an overly restrictive limit on banks' ties to the sector.

In a comment letter filed late on Friday and not yet made public, the industry argues the proposed rule would hurt the economy, and that fears about environmental risks from physical commodities activities are overblown.

The U.S. Federal Reserve handed down the proposal in September, after a public backlash stemming from the belief that big banks' involvement in commodities markets hurt consumers by driving up prices.

The comment letter, filed by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the Institution of International Bankers and seen by Reuters, comes as big banks face an uncertain future in Washington. Even though President Donald Trump has said he favors deregulation and has hired several Wall Street executives as advisers, it is unclear how he or the new Congress will approach various rules.

Apart from Goldman Sachs, few banks have large exposure to physical commodities any longer. At one time, it was a big and lucrative business for both Goldman and Morgan Stanley , due to a quirk in their regulatory structure. Other banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co , eventually plunged into the business as well, but exited as global capital requirements got more onerous, making such investments too costly to maintain.

The Fed's proposed rule would formalize and increase those standards, imposing what it has called a 1,250 percent risk weighting on banks that own, trade and move physical commodities. Among other measures, $1 in capital would need to be held for every $1 investment, the regulator's highest charge for the riskiest investments.

The rule could potentially force banks to withdraw from the commodities business altogether, because such capital charges would severely depress returns.

In its proposal, the Fed said new measures would shield banks and the broader financial system from a costly mishap like the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Advocates say the rule is also needed to help mitigate commodity price fluctuations and social conflicts that arise from commodity-related activities.

In the letter filed on Friday, the bank-affiliated groups said the rule would hurt "competition, end users, the liquidity of commodities markets ... and thus the real economy." A number of utility and power companies, including Calpine Corp , have also cited liquidity and price concerns.

Big banks have been using similar arguments in lobbying to roll back existing rules, including the Volcker rule limiting risky, speculative trading and the Durbin rule, which caps the fees they can charge retailers for processing debit card transactions. [nIFR8tqrNf] [nL1N1FT1R2]

Industry sources say the fight against the Fed's proposal is more about regaining a competitive edge than protecting an existing source of revenue.

Between 2007 and 2009, commodities trading accounted for as much as one-fifth of revenue for Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.

But over the past five years, Morgan Stanley has decreased its physical commodity assets to $179 million from $9.7 billion. Goldman Sachs has shed much of its energy infrastructure as well, though it is still a major trader of fossil fuels, trading more natural gas than both Chevron Corp and ExxonMobil Corp in certain quarters, according to Natural Gas Intelligence.

As regulated banks have scaled back, specialists like Glencore Plc , Vitol Group and Mercuria Energy Group have gained ground.

(Updates to open)

By Yashaswini Swamynathan

Feb 21 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks opened at record-highs on Tuesday as oil prices rose and investors cheered strong results of top U.S. retailers.

Wal-Mart's shares provided the biggest boost to the Dow, rising more than 3 percent after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly comparable store sales. [nL1N1G60DJ]

Department store bellwether Macy's and home improvement chain Home Depot rose after the companies posted profits that topped estimates. Home Depot also set a $15 billion buyback plan. [nL4N1G63G0]

Sentiment was boosted by a more than 1.5 percent rise in oil prices, after OPEC said the group was hopeful of higher compliance with its deal to cut production. [O/R]

The S&P 500 energy sector <.SPNY> jumped 0.75 percent, led by gains in Schlumberger and Chevron .

Strong earnings, robust economic data and the possibility of fiscal stimulus under President Donald Trump has lifted Wall Street's main indexes to record highs in the past months.

The dollar rose 0.58 percent after Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said on Sunday that she would be comfortable raising rates if the U.S. economy kept performing. Gold prices fell 0.74 percent. [nL1N1G502M]

Investors will keep an eye on comments from three Federal Reserve officials on Tuesday for insight into the timing of the next interest rate hike.

While some Fed officials have said a rate hike should come sooner than later, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said the U.S. labor market had "more room to run" suggesting he does not believe the central bank should raise rates quickly. [nU5N1D300J]

At 9:38 a.m. ET (1438 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> was up 66.87 points, or 0.32 percent, at 20,690.92, the S&P 500 <.SPX> was up 6.72 points, or 0.28 percent, at 2,357.88 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> was up 16.81 points, or 0.29 percent, at 5,855.39.

Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, while the traditionally defensive plays - real estate <.SPLRCR> and utilities <.SPLRCU> - the outliers.

Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen jumped 19 percent to $78.80 after Restaurant Brands agreed to acquire the quick-service restaurant chain for $1.8 billion. [nL1N1G50SW]

Kraft Heinz shares were the top drag on the S&P, falling 3.7 percent after the company walked away from its $143 billion offer to buy Unilever , a day after the Anglo-Dutch company rejected the proposal. Unilever's U.S.-listed shares were down 8.2 percent. [nL8N1G51CN]

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,828 to 840. On the Nasdaq, 1,624 issues rose and 789 fell.

The S&P 500 index showed 53 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 130 new highs and eight new lows.

RPT-ANALYSIS-U.S. shale oil braces for the unfamiliar in 2017: inflation - 路透新闻

{{20170220T070001.349+0000}}RPT-ANALYSIS-U.S. shale oil braces for the unfamiliar in 2017: inflation(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text)

By Swetha Gopinath and Arathy S Nair

Feb 17 (Reuters) - U.S. shale producers are facing their first production cost increase in five years in 2017 as industry activity picks up and energy service providers hike fees to take a bigger share of the profits generated by higher oil prices.

Drilling innovations over the past decade have generated a dizzying reduction in the cost of pumping oil from shale formations across the United States - the world's largest energy consumer - triggering an energy revolution and a production boom.

When that boom ended with the onset of a two-year global price war in 2014, shale producers responded with even deeper cost cuts. Technological breakthroughs allowed producers to wring more oil from the rock and halved the per-barrel price needed to turn a profit.

But for the first time since 2012, shale producers will see a rise in break-even production costs this year, according to data from Rystad Energy, which surveys producers. The per-barrel costs will rise an average of $1.60 across the shale patch to $36.50.

For a chart of the fall and recent rise of shale oil production costs, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2lxKeeX

The drive to lower costs has run its course for now, and service firms are leveraging power in the more crowded oilfields, such as the Permian basin in West Texas, to eke out higher payments from producers.

Firms that supply rigs, crews, technological expertise are clamoring to take back discounts they extended during the slump, in some cases asking for between 10 percent and 15 percent more as the number of rigs and crews deployed in the fields rises.

Producers expect that to continue.

"In the Permian, activity has picked up, and going forward we would expect to see some pressure," Chevron Corp's Chief Executive John Watson said on an earnings call last month.

Oil service providers acknowledge, however, that their price hikes may not stick until drillers generate enough demand to burn through the remaining spare capacity in the oil service sector.

In a securities filing on Feb. 8, service provider Baker Hughes Inc cautioned that drilling "activity needs to increase meaningfully before excess service capacity can be substantially absorbed and meaningful pricing recovery takes place."

PERMANENT COST SAVINGS

Service inflation represents only a fraction of the expected rise in international crude prices this year. A Reuters poll of 31 analysts and economists forecast benchmark U.S. oil prices will average $56.08 per barrel in 2017, up from $43.47 last year.

Between half and two-thirds of the cost savings achieved during the oil price slump are likely to become permanent even if oil prices tick higher, according to industry experts and company estimates.

Shale companies deployed more rigs than they have done in sixteen months last week [nL1N1FT11T], and have steadily increased the number in the field to take advantage of crude prices that have mostly held at more than $50 per barrel since the world's top oil exporters, both OPEC and non-OPEC, agreed to cut supplies in late November.

A further rise in the oil price could quickly stir drilling activity across the United States, which would in turn accelerate service fee and labor cost inflation. That is a worrying development for an industry that has lately gotten used to costs heading only down.

There were 207 hydraulic fracturing fleets at work in January across the U.S., up 20 percent from last June, according to data from Houston-based Primary Vision, which tracks oilfield service equipment usage.

Pioneer Natural Resources Co has its own fracturing crews, which it hopes will help offset rising service costs elsewhere.

"I believe we will be able to keep our inflation numbers down to more like approximately 5 percent, but the internal plan is to make sure that cost inflation is offset by our efficiency gains," Pioneer Natural Chief Executive Tim Dove said on a post-earnings call earlier this month.

HEDGING AGAINST INFLATION

Other companies have locked in contracts to insulate themselves from the rise in service and labor costs. WPX Energy, a leading shale oil producer in North Dakota and Texas, has sought to protect against price inflation through contracts for sand, stimulant, equipment and services, said CEO Rick Muncrief in an interview.

Other companies including Hess Corp hope to beat the inflation forecasts with yet more efficiency gains.

Hess hopes to wring more barrels out of each well with new techniques that allow it to conduct hydraulic fracturing at 60 spots along a well, up from the usual 50, president Greg Hill said on a conference call last month.

In addition, using more sand and other proppants - used to keep fissures in shale rock open - in the wells should help boost production, Hill said.

Oil producers can already count on many cost savings achieved in recent years, such as reductions in the time it takes to drill wells, said Gürcan Gülen, an energy economist at the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin.

"Once you know better how to do things, you're not going to change that when oil prices move higher," said Gülen.

But the possibility of more deep cost reductions are, for the most part, gone.

A number of companies saw break-even costs at the wellhead - the price required to profit from oil at a new well - stagnate between the third and fourth quarters, data from Rystad Energy showed.

"To certain producers, there's a little bit of opportunity to lower costs more," said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group. "But those are few and far between."

Shale companies deployed more rigs than they have done in sixteen months last week [nL1N1FT11T], and have steadily increased the number in the field to take advantage of crude prices that have mostly held at more than $50 per barrel since the world's top oil exporters, both OPEC and non-OPEC, agreed to cut supplies in late November.

A further rise in the oil price could quickly stir drilling activity across the United States, which would in turn accelerate service fee and labor cost inflation. That is a worrying development for an industry that has lately gotten used to costs heading only down.

There were 207 hydraulic fracturing fleets at work in January across the U.S., up 20 percent from last June, according to data from Houston-based Primary Vision, which tracks oilfield service equipment usage.

Pioneer Natural Resources Co has its own fracturing crews, which it hopes will help offset rising service costs elsewhere.

"I believe we will be able to keep our inflation numbers down to more like approximately 5 percent, but the internal plan is to make sure that cost inflation is offset by our efficiency gains," Pioneer Natural Chief Executive Tim Dove said on a post-earnings call earlier this month.

HEDGING AGAINST INFLATION

Other companies have locked in contracts to insulate themselves from the rise in service and labor costs. WPX Energy, a leading shale oil producer in North Dakota and Texas, has sought to protect against price inflation through contracts for sand, stimulant, equipment and services, said CEO Rick Muncrief in an interview.

Other companies including Hess Corp hope to beat the inflation forecasts with yet more efficiency gains.

Hess hopes to wring more barrels out of each well with new techniques that allow it to conduct hydraulic fracturing at 60 spots along a well, up from the usual 50, president Greg Hill said on a conference call last month.

In addition, using more sand and other proppants - used to keep fissures in shale rock open - in the wells should help boost production, Hill said.

Oil producers can already count on many cost savings achieved in recent years, such as reductions in the time it takes to drill wells, said Gürcan Gülen, an energy economist at the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin.

"Once you know better how to do things, you're not going to change that when oil prices move higher," said Gülen.

But the possibility of more deep cost reductions are, for the most part, gone.

A number of companies saw break-even costs at the wellhead - the price required to profit from oil at a new well - stagnate between the third and fourth quarters, data from Rystad Energy showed.

"To certain producers, there's a little bit of opportunity to lower costs more," said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group. "But those are few and far between."

Japan's heavyweight LNG buyers wrestle more flexible deals from suppliers - 路透新闻

{{20170217T070004.691+0000}}Japan's heavyweight LNG buyers wrestle more flexible deals from suppliersBy Aaron Sheldrick and Osamu Tsukimori

TOKYO, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Japan's liquefied natural gas (LNG) buyers are upending the traditional practices of the market, using their leverage as the world's biggest buyers of the fuel to wrestle concessions for more flexible terms.

Japan's electric utilities have won provisions that will allow them to divert contracted LNG cargoes if they restart their nuclear reactors, most of which have been shut since the 2011 Fukushima disaster, three sources have told Reuters. This could set a precedent as more contracts start coming up for renewal.

A shrinking population and greater use of alternative fuels has lowered Japan's LNG demand. Because of that, utilities have pushed to gain allowances to resell imported cargoes and reduce their dependence on long-term contracts. [nL3N1C236A] [nL3N1AR1E2]

A persistent supply glut and low spot prices have given Japan's utilities the upper hand in their negotiations with sellers. About 32 million metric tonnes of annual LNG capacity will come online in 2017, according to a forecast from Reuters Supply Chain and Commodities Research, equal to about 12 percent of 2016's global imports.

"With competition to place LNG heating up, price is not the only (contract) term under pressure. LNG suppliers will offer more innovative deals to secure sales," said Kerry Anne Shanks, head of LNG research for Asia at Wood Mackenzie. "Japan's power utilities are highly prized as customers."

Japan has traditionally used so-called take-or-pay contracts for LNG purchases that oblige them to pay for a fixed volume of imports, and they are restricted from reselling cargoes if demand drops.

Now, LNG buyers are being offered the restart provisions to entice them to sign up for new contracts, said an executive at one of Japan's gas importers. "This option was offered to us in a recent sales pitch."

These offers come as data from the International Group of Liquefied Natural Gas Importers (GIIGNL) shows that several long-term contracts between Japanese utilities, including Chubu Electric <9502.T>, Tohoku Electric <9506.T>, Shizuoka Gas <9543.T>, and producers including Malaysia's Petronas and Australia's Woodside Petroleum started to expire last year and more will expire in 2017 and 2018.

Many more of the contracts will be coming up for renewal in the coming five years, the GIIGNL data shows.

Neither, the Japanese utilities nor Petronas were available for comment on the ongoing contractual negotiations. Woodside did not comment on the talks.

Even as Asian spot LNG prices have dropped 65 percent from their 2014 peak, Japan's electric utilities still want to restart their nuclear reactors since they are a lower-cost power generation source.

REACTORS REMAIN SHUT

All but two of Japan's reactors remain shut since the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, and many are going through a relicensing process that is taking longer than expected. [nL4N1EA1EQ]

At most, six reactors could restart this year, said Takeo Kikkawa, professor at the Tokyo University of Science, who advised the government on its most recent energy policy, adding the outlook was cloudy for further restarts past that.

The utilities are likely taking advantage of downward quantity tolerances (DQT), standard provisions in gas contracts that stipulate the minimum amount of gas that must be paid for whether the buyer needs it or not, said a Japanese energy executive with more than 20 years of working in the gas business.

Typically, DQTs are set at around 10 percent, meaning if a buyer signs up for 1 million tonnes of gas, it must take at least 90 percent of that on a guaranteed payment basis.

"They are pushing for much greater DQTs," the executive said, adding that owners of older projects would likely offer these options.

"The older projects are fully depreciated. They have been going for many years and they recovered all their costs so their costs basis is low," he said.

In order to maintain market share in an oversupplied market, LNG sellers have become willing to tweak more flexible terms.

"Our production costs a lot of money to develop, and what a buyer calls flexibility, we know as uncertainty," said a commercial manager at a major LNG supplier. "There's already more LNG in the market than is needed, and more is coming, so as a producer we'll have to become that much more flexible in order to remain competitive."

(Adds losses to oil militancy)

By Tife Owolabi

PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Nigeria needs to offer work to people who make a living from illegally refining oil in the Niger Delta to achieve peace there, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo said on Tuesday.

The government has been holding talks with militants to end attacks on oil pipelines which cost the country up to $100 billion in lost oil revenues in 2016, Oil Minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu said in a video on his Facebook page.

But a military crackdown on thousands of illegal refineries in the southern swamps, which process crude oil stolen from oil majors and state oil firm NNPC, has raised tensions again.

Illicit refineries process stolen crude in makeshift, blackened structures of pipes and metal tanks hidden in oil-soaked clearings deep in the Niger Delta's thick bush land.

"Our approach to that is that we must engage them (illegal refiners) by establishing modular refineries so that they can participate in legal refineries," Osinbajo said during a visit to Rivers state, part of the Delta region.

"We have recognised that young men must be properly engaged," he said, without giving details.

He also said the government would make more provisions for an amnesty scheme for former militants who laid down arms in 2009 in exchange for cash stipends and job training.

Illegal refining is one of the few businesses flourishing in an otherwise desolate region, as petrol is scarce in Nigeria due to the country's derelict state refineries.

Authorities had originally cut the budget for cash payments to militants to end corruption but later resumed payments to stop surging pipeline attacks which cut output by 700,000 barrels a day for several months last year.

"We have to make more provisions for amnesty and provisions for social intervention," Osinbajo told residents of Port Harcourt, the region's major city. He has been visiting the Niger Delta since last month to calm tensions.

The militants and residents who sympathise with them say they want a greater share of Nigeria's oil wealth to go to the impoverished region.

Crude sales make up about 70 percent of government revenue and the attacks have deepened an economic crisis brought about by low global oil prices.

Nigeria's oil production climbed to 1.576 million bpd in January, roughly 102,000 bpd higher than December, according to secondary sources in a monthly OPEC report released on Monday

Osinbajo put total oil output last month at between 1.7 million bpd and 1.8 million bpd down from the 2.2 million bpd at the start of 2016.

UPDATE 1-As coal shortfall looms, miners enjoy unexpected boom - 路透新闻

{{20170210T063744.191+0000}}UPDATE 1-As coal shortfall looms, miners enjoy unexpected boom* Coal prices have surged, topping oil, LNG, copper gains in 2016

* Coal mining shares outperform in commodity sector

* Thermal coal markets to see supply shortfall in 2017

* Solid demand from China, SEAsia underpinning market

(Adds data on China coal imports, Adaro comment)

By Henning Gloystein

SINGAPORE, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Many a swan song has been sung for thermal coal markets as renewable power generation and a push towards using more natural gas have gained traction.

Yet a coal price spike last year, driven by a Chinese change in regulation that capped local mining operations, has shown how easily markets can swing from oversupply to shortfall.

While many analysts and investors see the long-term outlook for coal as bleak due to policies and technological advances that favour cleaner natural gas and renewable in power generation, its shorter-term prospects has seen a sharp reversal of fortunes.

"We are pleased to see the improvement in thermal coal market dynamics on the back of supply cuts in China and sustained demand," said Febriati Nadira, head of corporate communication at Indonesian mining major PT Adaro Energy .

China's coal imports jumped 64 percent in January from a year earlier, to 24.91 million tonnes, one of the highest in years, official customs data showed on Friday. [nL4N1FV1VT]

This year, strong demand growth in Asia's emerging markets will create a supply shortfall for the first time in around half a decade. Consumption could even soon rise past the 2014 peak, according to Asia's largest commodity trading house, Noble Group . [nL8N1DA2BD]

Despite coal's high levels of pollution, utilities and governments in emerging economies, at least for now, largely prefer coal-fired power over cleaner fuels in order to meet soaring energy demand.

While gas and solar prices have fallen sharply, coal remains one of the cheapest and most easily maintained sources of electricity.

More than 10 gigawatt (GW) of coal-fired power stations were sanctioned last year in Southeast Asia, where most new demand stems from, compared to just 4.6 GW of gas-fired projects, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

"New markets like the Philippines and Vietnam are starting to seek our coal," the chief executive of Indonesian coal miner PT Bukit Asam , Arviyan Arifin, told Reuters this week. [nL4N1FS22Q]

Rodrigo Echeverri, head of thermal coal analysis at Noble, believes this year's global thermal coal market will be 13 million tonnes short of meeting 911 million tonnes of demand, compared with a broadly balanced market in the last three years.

The tightness is a result of falling output after some companies including U.S. giant Peabody Energy , filed for bankruptcy, and other miners cut output at unprofitable mines. [nL1N1FM289]

At the same time, Chinese imports grew by 43 million tonnes as a result of restrictions on local production, while new coal-fired power plants were commissioned in countries including Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan, Echeverri told a conference in South Africa this month.

To meet the imminent shortfall, some miners have again begun ramping up output.

Indonesia, the world's biggest thermal coal exporter, said this month it is targeting production of 470 million tonnes in 2017, compared with its previous goal of 413 million tonnes and up more than 8 percent on last year. [nJ9N1EZ01F][nL4N1FR40N]

There are also signs that Australian thermal coal output is picking up, with exports from Queensland hitting a record last year. [nL4N1F029S]

Even so, the shortfall in supply could reach 28 million tonnes by 2020, meaning more new mines would need to be opened by the mid-2020s to meet demand, Echeverri said.

COAL OUTPERFORMS

Most commodities, including thermal coal , crude oil , copper or liquefied natural gas , have seen price rises since early 2016 as part of a broad-based rally.

Australian thermal coal has performed best, rising 53 percent price versus 48 percent for oil, 25 percent for copper, and just 8 percent for Asian LNG.

Because of this, companies focusing on seaborne coal supplies fared better than other miners or oil and gas producers.

"For pure coal players, the rise in prices from June 2016 ... provided the catalyst for improved export sales margins given that many producers were actively managing their production costs," said Patrick Markey, managing director of commodity advisory Sierra Vista Resources in Singapore.

This reversal of fortune of an industry that was deeply in trouble just a year ago has been noted by investors.

Shares in thermal coal specialists like Australia's Whitehaven Coal or Indonesia's Adaro Energy, are far outperforming their peers in the oil and gas sector like Australia's Woodside Petroleum , Royal Dutch Shell or Chevron .

Many oil and gas firms are grappling with cost overruns and production delays at facilities such as Chevron's Wheatstone condensate and LNG plant or Shell's Prelude floating LNG unit. [nL5N1FD06P]

Longer term, the rise of cheap natural gas and increasingly competitively priced renewable power generation is expected to eat away at coal's power market share.

"We see clear winners for the next 25 years – natural gas but especially wind and solar – replacing the champion of the previous 25 years, coal," the latest outlook from International Energy Agency (IEA) says.

In the meantime, producers are benefiting from Beijing's ongoing drive to remove dirty and inefficient mines, which is keeping seaborne coal prices in a sweet spot.

"Around $80 is a really, really good price for Australian mines," said Peter O'Connor, resources analyst for brokerage Shaw and Partners in Sydney.

Shares in thermal coal specialists like Australia's Whitehaven Coal or Indonesia's Adaro Energy , are far outperforming their peers in the oil and gas sector like Australia's Woodside Petroleum , Royal Dutch Shell or Chevron .

Many oil and gas firms are grappling with cost overruns and production delays at facilities such as Chevron's Wheatstone condensate and LNG plant or Shell's Prelude floating LNG unit. [nL5N1FD06P]

Longer term, the rise of cheap natural gas and increasingly competitively priced renewable power generation is expected to eat away at coal's power market share.

"We see clear winners for the next 25 years – natural gas but especially wind and solar – replacing the champion of the previous 25 years, coal," the latest outlook from International Energy Agency (IEA) says.

In the meantime, producers are benefiting from Beijing's ongoing drive to remove dirty and inefficient mines, which is keeping seaborne coal prices in a sweet spot.

"Around $80 is a really, really good price for Australian mines," said Peter O'Connor, resources analyst for brokerage Shaw and Partners in Sydney.

REFILE-UPDATE 1-Cargo loadings at Australia's North West Shelf project halted - sources - 路透新闻

{{20170208T100403.437+0000}}REFILE-UPDATE 1-Cargo loadings at Australia's North West Shelf project halted - sources(Refiles to correct link to interactive map)

By Mark Tay

SINGAPORE, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Loading of cargoes from Australia's North West Shelf (NWS) liquefied natural gas (LNG) and condensate project has been halted due to adverse weather, traders with direct knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday.

It remains unclear when cargo loadings at the port of Dampier will resume, said one person familiar with the matter who is facing loading delays for a cargo of NWS condensate.

In an emailed statement, Pilbara Ports Authority - which manages ports in the area - said LNG cargo loadings are likely to have stopped "as at the ports of Ashburton and Dampier, the ports and anchorages continue to remain clear of vessels".

The NWS project is operated by Australian firm Woodside Petroleum .

Woodside declined to comment on its loading operations, but said the company "is taking the necessary precautions to safeguard our people and assets".

The loading delays are unlikely to have an immediate impact in LNG or condensate prices as adverse weather along the Australian coast is common in January and February, traders said.

The impact of such loading delays are minimal as producers can claim force majeure, a Singapore-based LNG trader said. "Also, demand is now quite weak," the trader said.

NSW joint venture partners include BHP Billiton , BP , Chevron Corp , Japan's Mitsubishi Corp <8058.T> and Mitsui & Co <8031.T>, and Royal Dutch Shell .

UPDATE 2-Shell looking to sell stake in Danish venture -banking sources - 路透新闻

{{20170206T123644.041+0000}}UPDATE 2-Shell looking to sell stake in Danish venture -banking sources* Shell holds 36.8 pct stake in offshore consortium

* Sale of stake would mark Shell's exit from Denmark

(Adds DUC production figures)

By Ron Bousso and Clara Denina

LONDON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell is seeking to sell its stake in the Danish Underground Consortium (DUC), an offshore oil and gas joint venture, in what would mark the company's effective exit from Denmark, three banking sources said.

The stake is valued at up to $1 billion, according to two sources.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) is running the sale process, the sources said.

Shell owns a 36.8 percent stake in DUC alongside operator A.P. Moller-Maersk , which has 31.2 percent, Chevron which holds 12 percent, and Danish state-run Nordsøfonden which has a 20 percent stake.

Shell declined to comment. BAML was not available for immediate comment.

The consortium, which started production in 1972, currently operates 16 fields, In 2014 it produced 51 million barrels of oil, roughly 140,000 barrels per day, and 4 billion cubic metres of gas, according to Maersk's website.

Shell said last week it was close to selling assets totalling $5 billion to cut debt following its $54 billion acquisition of BG Group a year ago. [nL5N1FN4SJ]

The Anglo-Dutch company has sold around $12.5 billion in assets since mid-2015 as it tries to reach its target of $30 billion in disposals by 2018. It has said it plans to exit five to 10 countries in the process.

Last September, Shell agreed an $80 million sale of its remaining Danish downstream business, including its Fredericia refinery, to Denmark's Dansk Olieselskab. [nL8N1BR2XJ]

In March 2015, Shell agreed to sell its retail and commercial fuel marketing operations in Denmark to Canada's Alimentation Couche-Tard.

UPDATE 4-U.S. Republicans ax disclosure, emissions rules on energy - 路透新闻

{{20170203T184253.251+0000}}UPDATE 4-U.S. Republicans ax disclosure, emissions rules on energy(Adds details on methane rule, background)

By Lisa Lambert and Timothy Gardner

WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - U.S. Republicans on Friday repealed a securities disclosure rule aimed at curbing corruption at energy and mining companies and voted to ax emissions limits on drilling operations, part of a push to remove Obama-era regulations on extractive industries.

In a 52-47 vote, the Republican-controlled Senate approved a resolution to eradicate a rule requiring companies such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron Corp to publicly state taxes and other fees paid to foreign governments like Russia.

The House of Representatives already passed the measure. President Donald Trump is expected to sign it within days. On Thursday, the Senate repealed a rule that would have limited coal companies from dumping waste into streams. [nL1N1FN1RD]

After a number of legal battles, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in June 2016 completed the regulation, which supporters said could help expose questionable financial ties U.S. companies may have with foreign governments.

Senate Democrats raised concerns that Exxon's chief executive during those legal fights was Rex Tillerson, who was recently confirmed as U.S. secretary of state and has worked extensively in Russia.

"It should be lost on no one that in less than 48 hours, the Republican-controlled Senate has confirmed the former head of ExxonMobil to serve as our secretary of state, and repealed a key anti-corruption rule that Exxon Mobil and the American Petroleum Institute have erroneously fought for years," Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland said, referring to the oil industry's trade group.

Exxon and other major energy corporations fought for years to block the rule, required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.

Cardin, the senior Democrat on the foreign relations committee, wrote the Dodd-Frank section on the payments to foreign governments with Richard Lugar, a former Republican senator.

Critics of the rule said it duplicated existing regulations, was too costly and burdensome for companies to implement and that it put U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage with state-owned companies in other countries that do not have to divulge such information.

The change could give American companies an edge over Canadian and European companies that face some of the toughest transparency rules in the world. [nL1N1FO0K6]

RARELY USED LAW PREVENTS OPPOSITION

Republicans have taken advantage of a seldom-used law known as the Congressional Review Act to overturn recently enacted rules with simple majorities in both chambers, denying senators the opportunity to filibuster and stall a vote. [nL1N1FN1RD]

Democrats said Republicans were using the review act to help companies not the public.

"When it comes to giving public resources to private interests and gutting our nation's health, environmental and financial standards, the Republicans can't seem to act fast enough," said Representative Raul Grijalva. "Whoever they're doing this for, it isn't the American public."

The Congressional Review Act also bars agencies from revisiting overturned rules, which could pose a legal conundrum for the SEC, which is required by law to enact a payments regulation.

The Senate will next consider repealing a rule limiting venting and leaking of the powerful greenhouse gas methane by oil and gas drillers on federal and tribal lands, mostly in the U.S. West. The repeal was passed by the Republican-controlled House on Friday.

The Interior Department finalized the methane rule in November. The oil industry has argued that it would add to costs for new and existing wells. Environmentalists have said the rule would protect human health and return more than $800 million in royalties to taxpayers over 10 years.

UPDATE 1-U.S. transparency reversal stings Canadian, European oil firms - 路透新闻

{{20170203T140745.329+0000}}UPDATE 1-U.S. transparency reversal stings Canadian, European oil firms(Recasts with Senate vote, adds comment from EU in paragraph 10)

By Ernest Scheyder and Nia Williams

HOUSTON/CALGARY, Feb 3 (Reuters) - A reversal of U.S. transparency requirements for the natural resources industry could give American oil companies an edge over Canadian and European rivals who face some of the toughest rules in the world, according to company executives, legal experts and trade groups.

The U.S. Senate passed a resolution early on Friday to overturn the "resource extraction rule," an Obama administration regulation that required companies to disclose taxes and other payments to foreign governments.

President Donald Trump is expected to soon sign the resolution killing the rule, which had been aimed at discouraging shady dealing in far-flung nations. [nL1N1FO0JM]

The rule was among a handful of regulations ushered in during the final months of Barack Obama's presidency that the Republican-controlled Congress has targeted as overly burdensome for the U.S. economy.

Overturning the regulation leaves Canadian and European natural resource companies with far more stringent reporting standards for payments to foreign governments than U.S. behemoths like Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp .

Certain details of contract negotiations and terms of bids to access reserves must be divulged under the Canadian and European rules. That could provide American companies a glimpse of their rivals' negotiating tactics around the globe, without having to tip their hands in return.

"It definitely could put Canada at a disadvantage because we are fairly stringent on our rules, both domestically and internationally, on how our companies operate," said Mark Salkeld, chief executive officer of the Petroleum Services Association of Canada, an industry trade group.

European oil company Royal Dutch Shell Plc , meanwhile, pointed out that a U.S. reversal of the transparency requirements would go against the broader global trend in the notoriously murky industry.

"The trend that we have, with access to information, with bringing distant countries into our space all the time, we will have to live with that. I don't think any single political system can turn that around," Shell CEO Ben van Beurden told reporters when asked about the proposed U.S. regulation change.

A European Commission spokeswoman, Vanessa Mock, told Reuters that Europe has no plans to weaken its own rules as a result of the U.S. reversal.

'BANG FOR THEIR BUCK'

Required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's extraction rule was finalized last summer and was scheduled to take effect next year. Democratic proponents of the rule said it would help to curb corruption in foreign nations.

Canadian and European regulations were modeled after the Dodd-Frank efforts. But the rule was quickly targeted by congressional Republicans after victories in the November election that brought President Donald Trump and his anti-regulation, pro-energy agenda into the White House.

Trump has signaled a sweeping reduction in regulation to bolster the American drilling and mining industries, including undoing Obama's initiatives to combat climate change.

Vivek Warrier, a partner at Calgary law firm Bennett Jones, said that could put Canadian companies at an even steeper disadvantage.

"When a potential investor comes in, they will look at the additional regulatory compliance costs that will impact Canadian companies and probably conclude there's better bang for their buck south of the border," he said.

Suncor Energy Inc , Canada's largest oil and gas producer, said reporting on payments to foreign governments is a minor administrative burden. "But generally speaking we support reporting payments to governments, as it contributes to greater transparency," said Sneh Seetal, a Suncor spokeswoman.

Canadian Natural Resources Ltd and Cenovus Energy Inc , two Canadian oil producers, declined to comment.

American oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, meanwhile, say the regulation had threatened to put them at a competitive disadvantage to huge state-controlled oil companies like Russia's Rosneft Ltd [TNKBP.UL] and China's CNOOC Ltd <0883.HK>.

"As publicly-traded companies, we have to compete globally with state-owned companies who hold a large majority of proved reserves and have no similar transparency or reporting obligations," Exxon spokesman William Holbrook said.

Stephen Comstock, director of tax policy for the American Petroleum Institute, said revoking the U.S. extraction rule is "a necessary step by Congress to establish sensible regulations that balance increasing transparency without diminishing our industry's competitive advantage."

Exxon and the API said they support an alternative scheme whereby a host country would report to its citizens at a regular interval how much money in total was generated from extractive industries, without breaking out company details.

The U.S. oil industry also said the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act would still remain in effect, prohibiting bribery of foreign officials.

U.S. reversal on transparency could sting Canadian, European oil companies - 路透新闻

{{20170203T060001.734+0000}}U.S. reversal on transparency could sting Canadian, European oil companiesBy Ernest Scheyder and Nia Williams

HOUSTON/CALGARY, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Canadian and European oil companies will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage to their American rivals if U.S. lawmakers scrap tighter transparency requirements on the industry, as expected, according to company executives, legal experts and trade groups.

The U.S. Senate is poised to overturn the so-called "resource extraction rule", a regulation requiring U.S. natural resources companies to disclose taxes and other payments to foreign governments, in a vote that could come as early as Friday. [nL1N1FN1RD]

The rule is among a handful of regulations ushered in during the final months of Barack Obama's presidency that Republican lawmakers - who now control Congress - have targeted as being overly burdensome and bad for the U.S. economy. Democrats have no way to keep the law in place as Republicans need only a simple majority to kill the measure.

But overturning the regulation, set to take effect next year, would leave Canadian and European natural resource companies with the most-stringent reporting standards in the world for payments to foreign governments - as U.S. behemoths like Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp get a reprieve.

Certain details of contract negotiations and terms of bids to access reserves are currently required under regulations now in place in both Canada and Europe. Such information could reveal to competitors negotiating tactics and other metrics that many companies consider proprietary, observers say.

"It definitely could put Canada at a disadvantage because we are fairly stringent on our rules, both domestically and internationally, on how our companies operate," said Mark Salkeld, chief executive officer of the Petroleum Services Association of Canada, an industry trade group.

European oil company Royal Dutch Shell Plc , meanwhile, pointed out that a reversal in the United States would go against the broader global trend toward transparency in the notoriously murky industry.

"The trend that we have, with access to information, with bringing distant countries into our space all the time, we will have to live with that. I don't think any single political system can turn that around," CEO Ben van Beurden told reporters when asked about the proposed change in U.S. regulation.

UPDATE 3-Coal rule killed by U.S. Congress, others near chopping block - 路透新闻

{{20170203T005327.775+0000}}UPDATE 3-Coal rule killed by U.S. Congress, others near chopping block(Recasts, adds extraction vote, Manchin quote)

By Lisa Lambert

WASHINGTON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress moved swiftly on Thursday to undo Obama-era rules on the environment, corruption, labor and guns, with the Senate wiping from the books a rule aimed at reducing water pollution.

By a vote of 54-45, the Senate approved a resolution already passed in the House of Representatives to kill the rule aimed at keeping pollutants out of streams in areas near mountaintop removal coal-mining sites.

The resolution now goes to President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it quickly. It was only the second time the Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to stop newly minted regulations in their tracks, has been used successfully since it was passed in 2000.

The Senate then turned to an equally controversial rule requiring mining and energy companies such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron to disclose taxes and other payments they make to governments at home and abroad. Democrats, who cannot filibuster the resolution, attempted to slow the process by pushing debate late into the night, with a vote scheduled for shortly after 6:30 a.m. on Friday. [nL1N1FM268]

Republicans are using their control of Congress and the White House to attack regulations they believe hurt the economy. They cast the stream protection rule as harming industry and usurping state rights.

"The Obama Administration's stream buffer rule was an attack against coal miners and their families," said the top Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell, adding it had threatened jobs in his home state of Kentucky.

Environmental activists and many Democrats said it would have made drinking water safer by monitoring for pollutants such as lead.

"Given that many of these toxins are known to cause birth defects, developmental delays, and other health and environmental impacts, this basic monitoring provision was essential," said Jeni Collins, associate legislative representative for environmental group Earthjustice.

The coal industry hopes the repeal will lead Trump to overturn a moratorium by former President Barack Obama's administration on some coal leases.[nL1N1FN1N6]

Senator Joe Manchin, who represents West Virginia, historically coal country, was one of the few Democrats who supported killing the rule. He told CNN more than 400 changes had been made to the regulation as it was drafted.

"There's nobody in West Virginia that wants dirty water and dirty air, but you can't throw 400 different regulations ... on top of what we already have and expect anyone to survive," he said.

GUNS, PAY DISCRIMINATION

Also on Thursday, the House on Thursday overturned Obama administration rules addressing pay discrimination at federal contractors and requiring expanded background checks for gun purchasers who receive Social Security benefits and have a history of mental illness. It plans on Friday to kill a measure addressing methane emissions on public lands. The Senate will then take all three up. [nL1N1FL29C]

The Senate is also targeting rules enacted in the final months of Obama's administration for extinction. Senator David Perdue, a Republican from Georgia, introduced on Wednesday a resolution for killing one intended to protect users of gift and prepaid cards.

Under the Congressional Review Act, lawmakers can vote to undo regulations with a simple majority. Agencies cannot revisit overturned regulations. Timing in the law means any regulation enacted since May is eligible for repeal.

The House already approved a resolution ending the rule that requires oil companies to publicly state taxes and payments, which is part of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law.

Republicans and some oil and mining companies say the rule is burdensome and costly and duplicates other long-standing regulations.

Supporters of the rule see it as vital for exposing bribery and questionable financial ties U.S. companies may have with foreign governments, as well as showing shareholders how their money is spent. [nL1N1FN257]

U.S. House axes regulations on oil and mining company payments, stream pollution - 路透新闻

{{20170201T220550.911+0000}}U.S. House axes regulations on oil and mining company payments, stream pollutionWASHINGTON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday killed two Obama-era rules, one intended to root out corruption in the extraction sector and one aimed at reducing stream pollution.

Required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, the Securities and Exchange Commission's "extraction rule" was approved this summer to require oil, gas, mining and other companies to publicly state the taxes and other fees they pay to governments. Republicans say the requirement is burdensome and costly for energy companies, and also that it duplicates other long-standing regulations.

The stream buffer rule is intended to lessen the amount of waste from mountain-top removal coal mining deposited in local waterways. Republican lawmakers, though, say it is hurting coal jobs by placing unworkable limits on the industry.

The Republican-dominated Senate is expected to quickly take up killing both regulations and then send the resolutions to President Donald Trump to sign.

INSIGHT-As oil recovers, U.S. firms descend on the Permian Basin in West Texas - 路透新闻

{{20170201T191430.138+0000}}INSIGHT-As oil recovers, U.S. firms descend on the Permian Basin in West Texas(Updates with Endeavor considering IPO, link to FACTBOX)

By Ernest Scheyder

ODESSA, Texas, Feb 1 (Reuters) - In most U.S. shale oil regions, energy firms are making strategic but cautious bets as the price of oil holds above $50 a barrel.

Here in the Permian Basin of West Texas, the largest U.S. oil patch, the industry poured more than $28 billion into land acquisitions last year - more than triple what they spent in 2015.

Those deals set the stage for much larger investments needed to extract the oil from the ground - and they illustrate how the Permian Basin has become the epicenter for the U.S. shale resurgence after a historic oil price crash.

"We could easily see an extra 100 rigs out here in the Permian by June," said Josh Clawson of Gesco, a Midland, Texas, electrical contractor for oil drilling rigs.

That doesn't necessarily mean the investment blitz will extend to other U.S. oil regions. The industry's focus on the Permian reflects the simple math of profitability and a complex set of geographic advantages and technological advances that make it cheaper to drill here than in other major U.S. oil regions.

Permian Basin producers make money at the current crude price of about $53 per barrel because of the region's sprawling pipeline network, abundant labor and supplies, and warm winters that allow year-round work.

Most of America's shale industry needs prices above $60 a barrel to justify new projects and expansion. Oil has not hit that price since June 2015.

So at least for now, the Permian accounts for a disproportionate share of the industry's recovery. The amount spent on Permian land purchases and leases last year represented 39 percent of all deals nationally and tripled the activity seen in any other major U.S. oil region.

Acquisitions in North Dakota's Bakken shale fields, by comparison, accounted for 3 percent of all deals.

For a graphic comparing the land acquisitions in the Permian to other oil regions, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2jHDopg

Judging by the confident flow of capital into West Texas - a swagger bred in part by aggressive cost-cutting and innovation through the downturn - U.S. oil companies have retained their appetite for risk.

What remains to be seen, should per-barrel prices rise further, is whether companies continue to expand operations in the Permian as projects start to make more economic sense in other oil states including North Dakota, Colorado and Wyoming.

FAST START TO 2017

Oil companies started the new year with announcements of about $9 billion more in Permian land deals, including a $6.6 billion Exxon Mobil Corp buy that doubled its acreage in the basin.[nL4N1F74E1]

Occidental Petroleum Corp , WPX Energy , Noble Energy Inc and RSP Permian Inc have also made major commitments to the region.

The companies that have sold or leased their holdings have typically been smaller, privately-held firms aiming to take advantage of the high land prices rather than invest the millions of dollars needed to pump the oil.

The demand for West Texas acreage has sent land prices soaring in the last two years. One deal in December 2016 priced out at more than $63,000 an acre, double the price paid in similar deal earlier that year.

Double Eagle Energy Permian LLC and its predecessor companies have made a fortune buying and selling Permian acreage starting in 2009.

But Double Eagle's founders, who have snapped up 65,000 acres in the past two years, now plan to start drilling their holdings in addition to speculating on land values. The firm is preparing for an initial public offering with an expected valuation of $3 billion, according to a half dozen bankers who have examined its value.[nL1N1CI1LI]

"Activity breeds activity," said John Sellers, co-founder of Double Eagle, of the surge here. "The Permian is a really great basin to be in."

While land prices have risen fast, the cost of acreage still represents a small part of the profit equation. Most of the expense is tied to drilling and getting the oil to market.

Buyers of Permian acreage are moving quickly to tap their holdings. The number of rigs across the basin is up more than 28 percent in the past year; oil job postings here have more than doubled from lows of last March; and sales tax receipts for the region starting rising in November after falling for two years.

Oil firms are pumping 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude from the Permian, about a quarter of U.S. output of 8.9 million bpd.

EARLY ACTION

In Midland and nearby Odessa, centers for the West Texas industry, the buzz of economic growth has replaced the desolation of 2015 and early 2016.

Many storage yards are only half full - meaning more equipment is in the field.

Chevron Corp , which controls more than 1 million acres of Permian land, last year opened a new regional office in Midland. EOG Resources Inc and Occidental Petroleum Corp have office expansion plans of their own.

Concho Resources Inc , which is headquartered in Midland, has been renovating and expanding its downtown Midland offices and funding community projects, including a $400,000 makeover of a downtown park.

Permits for new home construction jumped 50 percent in November, the latest period for which data are available. And dinner at Midland's Texas Roadhouse Inc now requires a half-hour wait.

The job market has roared back.

"Everyone I know here is hiring," said J. Ross Lacy, a Midland councilman.

The resurgence gained momentum last summer when industry veteran Mark Papa's Silver Run Acquisition Corp bought Centennial Resource Development Inc , which controls premium acreage across the Permian.[nL1N1A51D0]

Papa is considered one of the preeminent oil executives of his generation, and his move from retirement back into the oil patch was seen as a sign by many that the Permian was heating up again.[nL1N1A51D0]

Two months later, Apache Corp said it had accumulated over 300,000 acres of Permian land over two years for less than $1,300 an acre.

"The Permian Basin represents the foundation of Apache's North American growth strategy," said Gary Clark, vice president of investor relations at Houston-based Apache.

Apache estimated the land had more than 3 billion barrels of oil, sparking speculation that the Permian holds far more oil than anyone had expected in a previously overlooked part of the basin.[nL3N1BJ3XA]

Anadarko Petroleum Corp sold acreage in east Texas earlier this month for $2.3 billion as it looked to raise cash to develop the 600,000 acres of Permian land it controls.[nL1N1F22LS]

The firm is relocating 200 employees and their families to Midland, a sign of faith in the region's long-term prospects.

PERFORMANCE ANXIETY

Many of recent Permian deals were paid for with cash from secondary stock offerings, an unusual step that investors typically dislike because it dilutes their stakes in companies. But in the Permian, it seems, investors see the payoff.

Companies turned to stock offerings for cash because debt markets were largely closed to oil producers during the two-year price downturn.[nL2N1800XD]

Diamondback Energy Inc paid more than $3 billion last year for Permian land in two separate transactions - deals financed through stock offerings. Diamondback executives said the deals were immediately profitable and should provide years of growth.

Executives at SM Energy Co and RSP Permian made similar comments in announcing their own deals late last year for $1.6 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively.[nL4N1CO3MW][nL4N1CJ552]

While shares of top Permian producers have risen in recent weeks, Wall Street's appetite for stock is unsated.

West Texas oil giant Endeavor Energy Resources LP[EERL.UL], one of the biggest private oil producers in the Permian, is considering taking advantage of that with an initial public offering to expand and pump more from the field, Chief Executive Chuck Moloy told Reuters. [L1N1FM1FJ]

Of the 44 analysts covering Pioneer Natural Resources Co - considered by many investors to be the top Permian producer - forty recommend buying it, according to Thomson Reuters data.

None recommend selling the stock.

Investors are seeing the same unique advantages that drew oil companies to wide-open spaces of West Texas.

"The industry is learning where the value really is," said Chuck Meloy, chief executive of Endeavor.

"And that's out here in the Permian."

{{20170201T120002.838+0000}}RPT-INSIGHT-As oil recovers, U.S. firms descend on the Permian Basin in West Texas(Repeating for additional clients with no changes to text)

By Ernest Scheyder

ODESSA, Texas, Feb 1 (Reuters) - In most U.S. shale oil regions, energy firms are making strategic but cautious bets as the price of oil holds above $50 a barrel.

Here in the Permian Basin of West Texas, the largest U.S. oil patch, the industry poured more than $28 billion into land acquisitions last year - more than triple what they spent in 2015.

Those deals set the stage for much larger investments needed to extract the oil from the ground - and they illustrate how the Permian Basin has become the epicenter for the U.S. shale resurgence after a historic oil price crash.

"We could easily see an extra 100 rigs out here in the Permian by June," said Josh Clawson of Gesco, a Midland, Texas, electrical contractor for oil drilling rigs.

That doesn't necessarily mean the investment blitz will extend to other U.S. oil regions. The industry's focus on the Permian reflects the simple math of profitability and a complex set of geographic advantages and technological advances that make it cheaper to drill here than in other major U.S. oil regions.

Permian Basin producers make money at the current crude price of about $53 per barrel because of the region's sprawling pipeline network, abundant labor and supplies, and warm winters that allow year-round work.

Most of America's shale industry needs prices above $60 a barrel to justify new projects and expansion. Oil has not hit that price since June 2015.

So at least for now, the Permian accounts for a disproportionate share of the industry's recovery. The amount spent on Permian land purchases and leases last year represented 39 percent of all deals nationally and tripled the activity seen in any other major U.S. oil region.

Acquisitions in North Dakota's Bakken shale fields, by comparison, accounted for 3 percent of all deals.

For a graphic comparing the land acquisitions in the Permian to other oil regions, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2jHDopg

Judging by the confident flow of capital into West Texas - a swagger bred in part by aggressive cost-cutting and innovation through the downturn - U.S. oil companies have retained their appetite for risk.

What remains to be seen, should per-barrel prices rise further, is whether companies continue to expand operations in the Permian as projects start to make more economic sense in other oil states including North Dakota, Colorado and Wyoming.

FAST START TO 2017

Oil companies started the new year with announcements of about $9 billion more in Permian land deals, including a $6.6 billion Exxon Mobil Corp buy that doubled its acreage in the basin.[nL4N1F74E1]

Occidental Petroleum Corp , WPX Energy , Noble Energy Inc and RSP Permian Inc have also made major commitments to the region.

The companies that have sold or leased their holdings have typically been smaller, privately-held firms aiming to take advantage of the high land prices rather than invest the millions of dollars needed to pump the oil.

The demand for West Texas acreage has sent land prices soaring in the last two years. One deal in December 2016 priced out at more than $63,000 an acre, double the price paid in similar deal earlier that year.

Double Eagle Energy Permian LLC and its predecessor companies have made a fortune buying and selling Permian acreage starting in 2009.

But Double Eagle's founders, who have snapped up 65,000 acres in the past two years, now plan to start drilling their holdings in addition to speculating on land values. The firm is preparing for an initial public offering with an expected valuation of $3 billion, according to a half dozen bankers who have examined its value.[nL1N1CI1LI]

"Activity breeds activity," said John Sellers, co-founder of Double Eagle, of the surge here. "The Permian is a really great basin to be in."

While land prices have risen fast, the cost of acreage still represents a small part of the profit equation. Most of the expense is tied to drilling and getting the oil to market.

Buyers of Permian acreage are moving quickly to tap their holdings. The number of rigs across the basin is up more than 28 percent in the past year; oil job postings here have more than doubled from lows of last March; and sales tax receipts for the region starting rising in November after falling for two years.

After slump in energy deals, hints of recovery: EY - 路透新闻

{{20170201T000101.571+0000}}After slump in energy deals, hints of recovery: EY* Deal volume down 27 pct in 2016 from year earlier: EY

* But deal value rose to $395 billion

* Recent pick up set to accelerate, EY's Brogan says

* GRAPHIC: 2016 Oil and Gas M&A (http://tmsnrt.rs/2jRdAHn)

By Ron Bousso

LONDON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - A sharp pick up in deal-making in the oil and gas sector in recent weeks has scope to accelerate as oil prices recover, advisory company EY said in a report.

While the number of deals in 2016 dropped year-on-year by 27 percent, their value rose to $395 billion from $340 billion in 2015.

Executives' appetite for acquisition clearly grew after OPEC and major non-OPEC oil producers agreed to cut output in November, boosting prices and instilling confidence that a recovery was under way. Exxon Mobil BP , Total and Statoil all signed major deals in the last few weeks of the year. [nL5N1F239Q]

Royal Dutch Shell on Tuesday announced $4.7 billion in asset sales, including a large chunk of its North Sea portfolio in what many analysts saw as a bellwether for M&A activity due to its relatively high operating costs. [nL5N1FL1XD]

"Transactions took a back seat to the more urgent task to adapt to new economic realities in the sector last year. A number of deals were initiated but not completed amid ongoing volatility," Andy Brogan, EY Global Oil and Gas Transaction Leader said.

"We expect to see the momentum that began in the fourth quarter of 2016 continue in the year ahead."

Oil prices have gradually recovered since January 2016, when they sank to a 13-year low of $27 a barrel, forcing companies to slash spending and shelve deals on oil and gas fields.

Deal activity in North America rose to $76 billion in 2016 from $43 billion in 2015, driven primarily by the shale oil Permian basin, with its low operating costs and high reservoirs, which spurred a record number of transactions, according to the EY report.

A total of 1,024 upstream deals were struck last year with a combined value of $130 billion.

The infrastructure sector, which includes pipelines and storage terminals, produced the largest increase in volume, rising by 37 percent to 93 deals worth $146 billion.

Deals in the refining sector, which is less influenced by oil price volatility, declined by 17 percent from a year earlier to 131 while rising in value by around 30 percent to $65.9 billion, EY said.

Major downstream assets included the $10.9 billion acquisition by a consortium led by Russia's oil champion Rosneft to acquire a 98 percent stake in an Indian refinery.[nL4N1CL05T
