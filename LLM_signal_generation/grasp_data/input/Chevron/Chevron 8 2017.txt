OSLO, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Norway's hope of discovering a large oilfield in the Barents Sea has suffered a major setback after the far north Arctic's most promising reservoir turned out to contain only small amounts of natural gas.

Statoil , the country's top oil and gas producer, has stepped up drilling in the Barents Sea this year as the government seeks to attract more explorers to its Arctic waters to make up for declining North Sea output.

But Statoil said on Tuesday that after drilling the northernmost exploration well in the highly anticipated Korpfjell prospect it had found only non-commercial quantities of gas and no oil.

"The results are of course disappointing, but it is too early to draw any conclusions on how this will impact the Barents Sea southeast area," Jez Averty, Statoil's head of exploration in Norway and UK, said.

Statoil, which is majority government-owned, had ranked the Korpfjell well as "high-impact", meaning that it could contain upwards of 250 million barrels of oil equivalents (boe) gross or 100 million boe for Statoil alone, while its partner Lundin Petroleum had said it could hold more than a billion barrels.

Statoil, however, said that the discovery made at Korfpjell is estimated to contain just 40-75 million boe or 6-12 billion standard cubic metres of gas, not large enough for commercial development.

Averty said Statoil needed to explore the area more, and planned a second Korpfjell well in 2018. Lundin also said it would continue to explore in the area.

The failure to make significant discoveries is also disappointing for Norway's right-wing government, which has sought to expand the petroleum industry in the Arctic region as production from the North Sea's mature areas is set to decline from the mid-2020s.

In April, Norway's oil industry regulator doubled its forecast for potential Barents Sea discoveries.

That alarmed green groups, which oppose Arctic drilling, and Greenpeace activists tried to stop drilling of the Korpfjell well earlier this month.[nL8N1L35W0] [nL8N1HX1QR]

DISAPPOINTING ARCTIC CAMPAIGN

Korpfjell was the fourth of Statoil's five planned exploration wells in the Barents Sea this summer, and the third that failed to prove commercial volumes.

Statoil's fourth exploration well drilled this year, known as Kayak, made a small oil discovery, which could be potentially tied in to the larger Johan Castberg field development.

News of the disappointing drilling results from Korpfjell sent Statoil shares down 1.9 percent by 0849 GMT, while shares of Lundin Petroleum tumbled 7 percent. Other partners in the Korpfjell license are Chevron , ConocoPhillips and state-owned Petoro.

"Gas is almost impossible to commercialize in these remote areas, and if the eastern Barents Sea is gas prone, it will have limited value potential," analysts at brokers DNB said in note. They cut their target for Lundin's share price by 4 crowns to 196 Swedish crowns ($24.76) on Tuesday.

Teodor Sveen-Nilsen, an analyst at Sparebank 1 Markets, said the results so far were slightly disappointing, but not disastrous.

"If more wells to be drilled in 2018 turn to be dry, then it would be really bad," he added.

($1 = 7.9148 Swedish crowns)

US STOCKS-Wall St closes little changed as Harvey pummels Texas - Reuters News

* Home Depot up on hopes of post-Harvey gains

NEW YORK, Aug 28 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Dow ended little changed on Monday, with energy and bank shares lower as Tropical Storm Harvey crippled the U.S. energy hub in Texas, while tech and healthcare gave a light boost to the Nasdaq.

Harvey, the most powerful hurricane to strike the southern U.S. state in more than 50 years when it came ashore on Friday, dumped more rain on Houston on Monday, and the flooding could worsen as engineers release water from overflowing reservoirs to keep it from jumping dams and surging uncontrollably. [nL2N1LE05R]

Market analysts said despite the human drama and infrastructure devastation, the market could take solace in the fact that a massive rebuilding effort would mostly offset the negative economic consequences of the flooding.

U.S. crude futures fell 2.5 percent to $46.68 per barrel over concerns that the refinery shutdowns could trigger an increase in crude inventories. Gasoline prices , however, rose. [nL4N1LE17O]

Oil majors Exxon and Chevron were down 0.3 percent and 0.4 percent respectively. Refiner Valero Energy climbed 1.1 percent.

Investors sought safe-haven assets, with gold rising to its highest in nearly 10 months.

But the search for safe havens was accompanied by stock picking in Home Depot , which rose 1.2 percent, and other companies likely to benefit from rebuilding efforts in the region. [nL2N1LE0GD]

"Home Depot will most certainly see a financial benefit from Hurricane Harvey, just as it did from Hurricane Sandy back in 2013," said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.

Insurer Travelers was the largest drag on the Dow with a 2.6 percent drop to $123.23, while Allstate fell 1.5 percent to $90.65 as investors assessed the likely impact of Harvey on the sector.

The S&P 500 financial sector <.SPSY> was the largest weight on the index, with a 0.5 percent drop. [nL2N1LE137]

"There tends to be initially a knee-jerk reaction and people react to the human side and the energy disruption, but that eases soon," said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, of the market's reaction to the major storm and its aftermath.

"This is a massive human tragedy and the worst of it may not be over yet, but as far as stock market impact I don't know if it is net-net a huge negative considering the fact it will bring in huge stimulus to the region."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> fell 5.27 points, or 0.02 percent, to close at 21,808.4, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 1.19 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,444.24

The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 17.37 points, or 0.28 percent, to 6,283.02 helped by rises in Apple and Gilead Sciences .

Kite Pharmaceuticals surged 28.0 percent to $178.05 after Gilead Sciences agreed to buy the immunotherapy developer in a deal valued at $11.9 billion. Shares of Gilead rose 1.2 percent. [nL4N1LE3SZ]

Expedia fell 4.5 percent after an internal memo by the online travel services company said its CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi, has been asked to lead Uber [UBER.UL].

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.14-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

About 5.13 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, compared with the near 6 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Aug 28 (Reuters) - The Dow and the S&P were slightly lower in early Monday afternoon after oil stocks slipped further as Tropical Storm Harvey bore down on the U.S. energy hub.

Harvey - the most powerful hurricane to strike Texas in more than 50 years when it came ashore on Friday - dumped more rain on Houston on Monday, worsening the flooding that has paralyzed the country's fourth-largest city. [nL2N1LE05R]

U.S. crude futures dipped by more than 3 percent to $46.21 per barrel over concerns that the refinery shutdowns could reduce demand for American crude.

The uncertainty pushed investors toward safe-haven assets, with gold rising to its highest in more than a week and U.S. Treasuries holding steady ahead of employment data on Friday.

"What it tells you is a slight risk-off trade. But nothing that is really shaking up the markets," said Matt Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management.

Oil majors Exxon and Chevron were down about 0.5 percent. Refiner Valero Energy climbed 1.70 percent.

"We're looking at this as more of a shorter term phenomenon and the energy stocks have held in relatively well," said Matt Miskin, market strategist at John Hancock Investments.

"The market is not seeing that as a significant move but we'll have to see how the dynamics play out over the course of the week."

Nine of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were lower, with the energy sector's <.SPNY> 0.91 percent fall leading the decliners, followed by financial index's <.SPSY> 0.67 percent.

Insurer Travelers fell 2.76 percent, the biggest drag on the Dow, while Allstate dipped 1.37 percent as investors assessed the likely impact of Harvey on the sector.

Flood damage from Harvey may equal that from 2005's Hurricane Katrina, which resulted in more than $15 billion in flood insurance losses, according to an insurance research group. [nL2N1LE029]

However, the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> was up 10.73 points, or 0.17 percent, at 6,276.38, helped by a rise in Apple and Gilead Sciences .

(Updates to open)

By Sruthi Shankar and Tanya Agrawal

Aug 28 (Reuters) - Wall Street opened slightly higher on Monday, driven by gains in health and home improvement retailers' shares, while investors assessed the impact of Tropical Storm Harvey on the U.S. economy.

Shares of insurers were down, as Harvey was set to dump more rain on Houston on Monday, worsening the flooding that has paralyzed the country's energy hub. [nL2N1LE05R]

Harvey, the most powerful hurricane to strike Texas in more than 50 years, has knocked out a quarter of oil production from the Gulf of Mexico, prompting fears it could overturn years of excess U.S. oil capacity and low prices. [O/R]

U.S. crude futures , which earlier hit two-year highs, dipped more than 1 percent to $47.38 over concerns that refinery shutdowns could reduce demand for American crude.

However, Home Depot was up 1.34 percent, boosting the Dow, while Lowe's rose 2 percent as the two largest U.S. home improvement chains could be among the biggest beneficiaries of post-Harvey recovery. [nL2N1LD0PU]

"The unfortunate event from Hurricane Harvey will have some sort of impact on the numbers, down the line ... at this point, it does not appear to affect equities," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital.

U.S. economic growth had more than halved in the quarter after Hurricane Katrina mauled Louisiana in August 2005.

"The Wall Street population is thinner than usual, and we've had no fresh news of any type, whether it's on the geopolitical front or from the administration, that has materially impacted traders' outlook," said Bakhos.

At 9:41 a.m. ET (1341 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> was up 18.34 points, or 0.08 percent, at 21,832.01, the S&P 500 <.SPX> was up 4.48 points, or 0.18 percent, at 2,447.53.

The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> was up 12.88 points, or 0.21 percent, at 6,278.52.

Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the health index's <.SPXHC> 0.51 percent rise leading the advancers.

Shares of Kite Pharmaceuticals soared 28.94 percent after Gilead Sciences agreed to buy the immunotherapy developer in an all-cash deal valued at $11.9 billion. Shares of Gilead gained 1.65 percent. [nL4N1LE3SZ]

The dollar index <.DXY> fell to as low as 92.372, its weakest since early May 2016, before recovering to trade down 0.34 percent at around 92.42.

The currency has been under pressure since Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen stayed silent on monetary policy in a much-anticipated speech on Friday.

Among stocks, Marathon Oil , Valero Energy were up about 2 percent. Oil majors Exxon inched up 0.13 percent and Chevron rose 0.22 percent.

Aug 28 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set to open slightly higher on Monday, even as investors assessed the impact of Tropical Storm Harvey on the U.S. economy.

Stocks of refiners, pipeline operators, insurers and home improvement retailers will be in focus after Harvey was set to dump more rain on Houston on Monday, worsening flooding that has paralyzed the country's energy hub. [nL2N1LE05R]

Harvey has knocked out a quarter of oil production from the Gulf of Mexico, prompting fears it could overturn years of excess U.S. oil capacity and low prices. [O/R]

U.S. crude futures , which earlier hit two-year highs, dipped more than 1 percent to $47.38 over concerns that refinery shutdowns could reduce demand for American crude.

"The unfortunate event from Hurricane Harvey will have some sort of impact on the numbers, down the line ... at this point, it does not appear to affect equities," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital.

U.S. economic growth had more than halved in the quarter after Hurricane Katrina mauled Louisiana in August 2005.

"The Wall Street population is thinner than usual, and we've had no fresh news of any type, whether it's on the geopolitical front or from the administration, that has materially impacted traders' outlook," said Bakhos.

Dow e-minis <1YMc1> were up 22 points, or 0.1 percent, with 21,013 contracts changing hands at 8:34 a.m. ET (1234 GMT).

S&P 500 e-minis were up 3.75 points, or 0.15 percent, with 128,391 contracts traded.

Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 10.25 points, or 0.18 percent, on volume of 30,705 contracts.

The dollar index <.DXY> fell to as low as 92.372, its weakest since early May 2016, before recovering a little to trade down 0.28 percent at around 92.48.

The currency has been under pressure after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen stayed silent on monetary policy in a much-anticipated speech on Friday.

Among stocks, Marathon Oil , Valero Energy and ConocoPhillips were up about 1.3 percent. Oil majors Exxon inched up 0.1 percent and Chevron rose 0.6 percent.

Home Depot was up 1.55 percent, while Lowe's rose 1.91 percent as the two largest U.S. home improvement chains could be among the biggest beneficiaries of post-Harvey recovery. [nL2N1LD0PU]

Shares of Kite Pharmaceuticals soared 28.89 percent after Gilead Sciences agreed to buy the immunotherapy developer in an all-cash deal valued at $11.9 billion. Shares of Gilead gained 1.3 percent. [nL4N1LE3SZ]

UPDATE 1-Harvey throws a wrench into U.S. energy engine - Reuters News

{{20170828T010015.302+0000}}UPDATE 1-Harvey throws a wrench into U.S. energy engine(Updates to change lead, adds paragraph on SPR)

By Ernest Scheyder and Erwin Seba

HOUSTON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - A hurricane in the heart of the U.S. energy industry is set to curtail near-record U.S. oil production for several weeks, with the impact expected to reverberate throughout the country and across international energy markets.

Harvey hit the Texas shore as a fierce Category 4 hurricane, causing massive flooding that has knocked out 11 percent of U.S. refining capacity, a quarter of oil production from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and closed ports all along the Texas coast.

Gasoline futures jumped as much as 7 percent to their highest level in more than two years in early Monday trading in Asia as traders took stock of the storm's impact.

The outages will limit the availability of U.S. crude, gasoline and other refined products for global consumers and further push up prices, analysts said.

Damage assessments could take days to weeks to complete, and the storm continues to drop unprecedented levels of rain as it lingers west of Houston, home to oil, gas, pipeline and chemical plants. And restarts are dangerous periods, as fires and explosions can occur.

So far, the federal government has not announced if it will release barrels of oil or refined products from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), which holds nearly 680 million barrels of oil.

The SPR was established in the 1970s to prevent supply shocks in the wake of an embargo imposed by several members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

"This is not like anything we have ever seen before," said Bruce Jefferis, chief executive of Aon Energy, a risk consulting practice. It is too soon to gauge the full extent of Harvey's damage to the region's energy infrastructure, he said.

More than 30 inches (76 cm) fell in the Houston area in 48 hours and a lot more rain is forecast, according to the National Weather Service.

The storm was felt from coastal ports to inland oil and gas wells. Oil producers in the Eagle Ford shale region of south Texas have halted some operations.

At least four marine terminals in the Corpus Christi area, an export hub for energy deliveries to Latin America and Asia, remained closed due to the storm. [nL2N1LD06K]

"We just simply don't know yet the damage all this rain will have on Houston's energy infrastructure," said Andrew Lipow, president of energy consultancy Lipow Oil Associates LLC.

Texas refineries could be offline for up to a month if their storm-drainage pumps become submerged, he said.

As the storm churned towards Texas on Friday, U.S. gasoline futures rose to their highest level in three years for this time of year. Those gains came even before several large Houston area refiners, including Exxon Mobil Corp , halted some operations.

Exxon closed the second largest U.S. refinery, its 560,500 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Baytown, Texas, complex because of flooding. Royal Dutch Shell Plc also halted operations at its 325,700-bpd Deer Park, Texas, refinery. The refinery may be shut for the week, it said.

Flooding on highways between Houston and Texas City nearer to the coast led Marathon Petroleum Corp to cut back gasoline production at the company's 459,000-bpd Galveston Bay Refinery in Texas City, said sources familiar with plant operations.

Marathon Petroleum employees were unable to drive to work and conditions at the plant forced the company to reduce gasoline output, said industry sources. Marathon spokesman Jamal Kheiry declined to discuss plant operations. Not every plant in the region was hit. Operations were stable at the largest U.S. crude refinery, Motiva Enterprises' [MOTIV.UL] 603,000-bpd Port Arthur plant, the company said.

Motiva double-staffed the refinery's crew ahead of the storm, as did Total SA at the company's 225,500-bpd Port Arthur refinery, said sources familiar with plant operations.

Coastal refineries in Texas account for one-quarter of the U.S. crude oil refining capacity. All of those refineries have been impacted by Harvey since Thursday when refineries in Corpus Christi, Texas, shut in production ahead of the storm's landfall on Friday.

Colonial Pipeline, the largest mover of gasoline, diesel and other refined products in the United States, said its operations had not been affected by Harvey. Any disruptions to the conduit would send prices across the U.S. Southeast and Northeast soaring. Traders have been keeping a close eye on whether there will be an outage at the pipeline.

Citgo Petroleum Corp [PDVSAC.UL] and Flint Hills Resources [FHR.UL], two of the refiners that closed last week as the storm approached, did not provide updates about the status of their Corpus Christi refineries on Sunday.

HOUSTON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - A hurricane in the heart of the U.S. energy industry is expected to upend years of U.S. excess oil capacity and low prices, with the impact expected to reverberate globally and affect energy markets for weeks.

Harvey hit the Texas shore as a fierce Category 4 hurricane, causing massive flooding that knocked out 11.2 percent of U.S. refining capacity, a quarter of oil production from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and closed ports all along the Texas coast.

Gasoline futures jumped as much as 7 percent to their highest level in more than two years in early Monday trading in Asia as traders took stock of the storm's impact.

The outages will limit the availability of U.S. crude, gasoline and other refined products for global consumers and further push up prices, analysts said.

Damage assessments could take days to weeks to complete, and the storm continues to drop near-biblical amounts of rain as it lingers west of Houston, home to oil, gas, pipeline and chemical plants.

More than 30 inches (76 cm) fell in the Houston area in 48 hours and a lot more rain is forecast, according to the National Weather Service.

About 22 percent of U.S. Gulf oil output offline due to Harvey - Reuters News

{{20170827T181522.493+0000}}About 22 percent of U.S. Gulf oil output offline due to HarveyHOUSTON, Aug 27 (Reuters) - About 22 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil production is offline due to Tropical Storm Harvey, the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) said on Sunday.

Output levels rose slightly from Saturday, when roughly 25 percent of Gulf oil output was offline.[nL2N1LC0CG]

The amount of production offline on Sunday was roughly 378,633 barrels of oil per day out of the roughly 1.75 million bpd pumped from the Gulf.

About 26 percent of Gulf natural gas production is offline, or about 828 million cubic feet (23.4 million cubic meters) per day, BSEE said.

Roughly 105 platforms have been evacuated in the Gulf so far as a result of Harvey, about 14.3 percent of those in the region. Half of the drilling rigs in the Gulf remain evacuated, BSEE said.

BSEE tabulates the data by polling 30 Gulf operators.

UPDATE 1-Statoil, YPF to explore shale oil, gas in Argentina - Reuters News

{{20170825T133100.838+0000}}UPDATE 1-Statoil, YPF to explore shale oil, gas in Argentina(Adds expected investment amount, context from Reuters interview with YPF chairman)

OSLO, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Norway's Statoil has signed a deal with Argentina's leading energy company YPF to jointly explore for onshore shale oil and gas resources in the Vaca Muerta formation, the company said on Friday.

Statoil and YPF will each hold 50 percent in the Bajo del Toro exploration block, it said. Statoil will recognise YPF's past costs in the block and will finance 100 percent of the cost of some activities, it added.

"This is a light oil exploration project in a world-class unconventional resource play, the Vaca Muerta formation," Statoil's exploration chief, Tim Dodson, said.

The companies will invest between $300 million and $500 million, in line with previous partnerships between YPF and foreign oil majors in Vaca Muerta, according to a source familiar with the agreement who asked not to be identified because the deal was preliminary.

One of the world's largest shale gas formations, roughly the size of Belgium, Vaca Muerta has remained mostly undeveloped due to high production costs and lack of labor flexibility.

Argentinian President Mauricio Macri reached a deal this year with unions and oil companies, including Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell to support the development.

The Bajo del Toro exploration permit covers an area of 157 square km in the Neuquen Basin in the west-central part of Argentina.

The agreements with YPF have to be approved by the Neuquen provincial authorities, Statoil said.

Earlier this month, YPF Chairman Miguel Gutierrez told Reuters in an interview that more partnerships with oil majors could be announced. [nL1N1KQ1SF]

By Jim Forsyth

SAN ANTONIO, Aug 24 (Reuters) - A Gulf of Mexico storm rapidly intensified on Thursday spinning into the potentially biggest hurricane to hit the mainland United States in 12 years and taking aim at the heart of nation's oil refining industry.

Hurricane Harvey is forecast to make landfall late Friday or early Saturday, packing winds of up to 125 miles per hour (201 km per hour). The storm could bring a surge in sea levels as high as 12 feet (3.7 meters) and dump up to 35 inches (97 cm) of rain over parts of Texas. Flood warnings are also in effect for northern Mexico and Louisiana.

The threat has triggered evacuations and canceled the first day of school in communities along the south Texas coast, which is home to 5.8 million people from Corpus Christi to Galveston.

Energy companies shut coastal refineries, pulled workers from Gulf of Mexico offshore oil platforms and halted onshore drilling in south Texas on Thursday. Just under 10 percent of offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico crude output capacity and nearly 15 percent of natural gas production was halted by midday, government data showed.

Harvey is forecast to come ashore as a Category 3 hurricane, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said, the third most powerful on the Saffir-Simpson scale, which would make it the first major hurricane to hit the mainland United States since Hurricane Wilma struck Florida in 2005.

Louisiana and Texas issued disaster declarations, authorizing the use of state resources to prepare for the storm. The NHC expects Harvey to move slowly over Texas and linger over the state for days, dumping as much 35 inches (97 cm) of rain on some areas. Louisiana could see 10 to 15 inches of rain.

"With this system's intensity and slow motion, it is the worst of both worlds," said John Tharp, a forecaster with Weather Decision Technologies in Norman, Oklahoma. "There will be major impacts along the coast and inland with periods of prolonged rain."

Harvey will bring rains and a storm surge that will bring "life-threatening and devastating flooding" to parts of the Texas coast, the NHC said in an advisory.

President Donald Trump has been briefed on the storm and stands ready to provide resources if needed, the White House said on Thursday.

Houston, the nation's fourth most populous city, warned residents of flooding from close to 20 inches of rain over several days.

"I hope people will listen to forecasters when they say 'beware of flash floods,'" Corpus Christi Mayor Joe McComb told residents of the Texas city nearest to expected landfall. "Flash floods can come quickly, and they can be deadly."

GASOLINE PRICES SPIKE

The NHC expects the storm to come ashore along the central Texas coast, an area that includes Corpus Christi and Houston, home to some of the biggest refineries in the country.

More than 45 percent of the country's refining capacity is along the U.S. Gulf Coast, and nearly a fifth of the nation's crude oil is produced offshore in the region. Ports from Corpus Christi to Texas City, Texas, were closed to incoming vessels.

Harvey has already disrupted U.S. oil supplies in the region.

Three refineries in Corpus Christi and one farther inland at Three Rivers were shutting down ahead of the storm. Concern that Harvey could cause shortages in fuel supply drove benchmark gasoline prices to a three-week high.

One other refinery reduced output and others were considering shutting. [nL2N1LA147]

Prices for gasoline in spot physical markets on the Gulf Coast rose even more, hitting a one-year high.

Profit margins for refineries producing gasoline rose by over 12 percent, on course for their biggest daily percentage gain in six months, according to Reuters data. [nL2N1LA13D] [nL2N1LA0X8]

The four refineries shutting down have combined capacity to refine more than 840,000 barrels per day of crude.

Energy companies including Royal Dutch Shell Plc , Anadarko Petroleum Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp have evacuated staff from offshore oil and gas platforms in the storm's path. [nL2N1L91XY]

Around 167,000 barrels per day, or 9.6 percent, of crude output capacity in the Gulf was shut, the U.S. government said. Natural gas production of 472 million cubic meters per day, or 14.6 percent of output, also was halted, the U.S. reported.

The storm could also bring flooding to inland shale oil fields in southern Texas that produce more than one million barrels of oil a day.

EOG Resources Inc on Thursday said it has curtailed drilling and shut in some production in the Eagle Ford shale region. Noble Energy Inc and Statoil ASA also said it was evacuating some staff from production facilities in the region.[nL2N1LA190]

CORRECTED-UPDATE 4-Fuel prices rise, refiners shut as U.S. braces for major hurricane - Reuters News

{{20170824T201103.390+0000}}CORRECTED-UPDATE 4-Fuel prices rise, refiners shut as U.S. braces for major hurricane(Corrects spelling of Saffir–Simpson scale in paragraph 3)

* Hurricane Harvey to hit central Texas late Fri-early Sat

* Could be most powerful storm to hit U.S. mainland since 2005

* Two refineries shut in Corpus Christi, others consider closing

* Nearly 10 pct of U.S. Gulf offshore crude output shut

By Jim Forsyth

SAN ANTONIO, Aug 24 (Reuters) - U.S. gasoline prices surged to a three-week high on Thursday as Hurricane Harvey moved across the Gulf of Mexico and threatened to strike the heart of the country's oil refining industry when it comes ashore in Texas this weekend.

Communities in the path of the quickly strengthening storm began evacuating and energy firms shut refineries and offshore oil and gas platforms. Just under 10 percent of offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico crude output capacity was shut down on Thursday, government data showed.

Harvey is forecast to come ashore as a Category 3 hurricane, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said, the third most powerful on the Saffir–Simpson scale, which would make it the strongest to hit the U.S. mainland in 12 years.

Such storms pack winds of up to 129 miles (208 km) per hour and Harvey would be the first Category 3 hurricane to make land in the United States since Hurricane Wilma struck Florida in 2005.

The NHC expects Harvey to move slowly over Texas and linger over the state for days, dumping as much 30 inches (76.2 cm) of rain on some areas.

"With this system's intensity and slow motion, it is the worst of both worlds," said John Tharp, a forecaster with Weather Decision Technologies in Norman, Oklahoma. "There will be major impacts along the coast and inland with periods of prolonged rain."

Harvey will cause a storm surge that will flood parts of the Texas coast as it makes landfall, the NHC said in an advisory.

The mayor of Texas coastal city Corpus Christi warned on Wednesday that flooding was his biggest concern and urged people to evacuate from low-lying areas.

"I hope people will listen to forecasters when they say 'beware of flash floods,'" Mayor Joe McComb said. "Flash floods can come quickly, and they can be deadly."

The city, a major oil refining center, has not issued any evacuation orders, he told reporters at a news conference, but its emergency operations center has been activated.

The NHC expects the storm to come ashore along the central Texas coast, an area that includes Corpus Christi and Houston, home to some of the biggest refineries in the country.

More than 45 percent of the country's refining capacity is along the U.S. Gulf Coast, and nearly a fifth of the nation's crude oil is produced offshore in the region.

Harvey has already disrupted U.S. oil supplies in the region.

Two oil refineries in Corpus Christi were shutting down ahead of the storm, and concern that Harvey could cause shortages in fuel supply drove benchmark gasoline prices to a three-week high.

One other refinery reduced output and other were considering shutting. [nL2N1LA147]

Prices for gasoline in spot physical markets on the Gulf Coast rose even more, hitting a one-year high.

Profit margins for refineries producing gasoline rose by over 12 percent, on course for their biggest daily percentage gain in six months, according to Reuters data. [nL2N1LA13D] [nL2N1LA0X8]

The two refineries that have shut have combined capacity to refine more than 450,000 barrels per day of crude.

Energy companies including Royal Dutch Shell , Anadarko Petroleum and Exxon Mobil have evacuated staff from offshore oil and gas platforms in the storm's path. [nL2N1L91XY]

Around 167,000 barrels per day, or 9.6 percent, of crude output capacity in the Gulf was shut, the U.S. government said.

The storm could also bring flooding to inland shale oil fields in Texas that pump millions of barrels per day of crude.

Norwegian oil firm Statoil ASA said on Thursday it would evacuate staff from the Eagle Ford shale region in South Texas. The firm will close wells if there is a flooding risk, a spokesman said. [nL2N1LA190]

Texas Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of disaster on Wednesday for 30 counties, authorizing the use of state resources to prepare for the storm.

Coastal cities and counties distributed sandbags to residents as some businesses boarded up windows, and residents flocked to grocery stores to stock up on supplies, local media reported.

Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi issued a mandatory evacuation to all students who live on campus and canceled events.

Tropical storm Harvey heads for Texas, may become hurricane - Reuters News

{{20170824T083013.113+0000}}Tropical storm Harvey heads for Texas, may become hurricaneAug 24 (Reuters) - The Texas Gulf Coast was getting ready for the tropical storm Harvey to make landfall by Friday, bringing with it strong winds, heavy flooding and torrential rains.

Hurricane, tropical storm and storm surge watches were in effect for counties on the eastern coast of Texas as the storm moved across the Gulf of Mexico, where it may strengthen into a hurricane.

Winds up to 75 mph (120 km) and 15 inches of rain (40 cm) were forecast, according to the National Weather Service.

"Now is the time to check your emergency plan and take necessary actions to secure your home or business. Deliberate efforts should be underway to protect life and property," the weather service said in an statement early on Thursday.

By early Thursday morning, Harvey was about 410 miles (660 km) southeast of Port Mansfield, Texas, with maximum sustained winds of 45 miles per hour (70 kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.

The storm may strengthen into a hurricane by the time it makes landfall near Corpus Christi on Friday, the National Weather Service said.

Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of disaster on Wednesday for 30 counties, authorizing the use of state resources to prepare for the storm. Harvey "poses a threat of imminent disaster, including severe flooding, storm surge and damaging winds," Abbott's statement said.

Cities and counties along the state's coastal region distributed sandbags to residents as some businesses boarded up windows. Coastal residents flocked to grocery stores to stock up on water and other supplies, local media reported.

Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi issued a mandatory evacuation to all students who live on campus and canceled events.

UPDATE 2-Oil companies evacuate workers as storm takes aim at Texas - Reuters News

{{20170824T032304.106+0000}}UPDATE 2-Oil companies evacuate workers as storm takes aim at Texas(Adds comments from Exxon Mobil in 4th paragraph.)

By Liz Hampton

HOUSTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell , Anadarko Petroleum and Exxon Mobil announced they were curbing some oil and gas output on Wednesday at facilities in the Gulf of Mexico ahead of a storm expected to hit the Texas coast later this week.

The U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued a hurricane watch Wednesday for much of the Texas coast, calling for slow-moving Tropical Depression Harvey to intensify as it nears landfall.

Shell said it was evacuating all personnel from the roughly 100,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Perdido oil and gas production platform as a precaution. Anadarko said it had shut in production and was evacuating workers from its Boomvang, Gunnison, Lucius and Nansen platforms in the Gulf of Mexico.

Exxon was in the process of reducing production at its Hoover facility in the Gulf of Mexico, company spokeswoman Suann Guthrie said.

The company said it was also working on transportation plans for staged evacuation of its personnel from its offshore facilities, expected to be in the path of the storm, to shore.

The U.S. Gulf of Mexico is home to about 17 percent of the nation's crude oil output and 5 percent of dry natural gas output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. More than 45 percent of the nation's oil refining capacity is along the U.S. Gulf Coast.

Harvey, which had top sustained winds of about 35 miles (55 km) per hour as it churned over Mexico's Bay of Campeche late Wednesday, could become a hurricane by Friday, the NHC said in an advisory.

Between 10 inches and 15 inches (25 cm to 38 cm) of rain are expected from the central Texas coast to southwest Louisiana, with some areas receiving up to 20 inches of rain, according to the Miami-based NHC.

"Heavy rainfall is likely to spread across portions of eastern Texas, Louisiana, and the lower Mississippi Valley from Friday through early next week and could cause life-threatening flooding," the NHC said.

Texas Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of disaster for 30 counties ahead of the storm.

In Corpus Christi, city officials warned residents to expect a storm surge of between four feet and six feet (1.83 m) and began distributing sand bags to local residents.

Other Gulf of Mexico oil and gas operators said they were watching developments closely but operations were unaffected.

Chevron on Wednesday afternoon said it had not evacuated any staff and BP Plc said normal operations were still underway. ConocoPhillips said it was making preparations but had not interrupted any operations.

UPDATE 2-Russia's Rosneft allocates four months of Venezuelan oil -traders - 路透新闻

{{20170823T225152.492+0000}}UPDATE 2-Russia's Rosneft allocates four months of Venezuelan oil -traders(Adds no comment from PBF Energy, Phillips 66)

By Marianna Parraga

HOUSTON, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Russian oil firm Rosneft has struck deals with several buyers for almost its entire quota of Venezuelan crude for the remainder of the year, traders told Reuters on Wednesday, the first time it has conducted such a large sale of the OPEC member's oil.

Rosneft, which is taking a growing volume of Venezuelan crude and products while extending credits to President Nicolas Maduro's government, previously had resold the barrels in the United States and Asia through trading firms, according to PDVSA's [PDVSA.UL] internal documents. [nL1N1KW27W]

The new sales mechanism is similar to the one used by Andes Petroleum, a China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and Sinopec joint venture, to sell its quota of Ecuadorian crude by awarding the barrels through annual or biannual tenders, one of the traders said. [nL1N1CY1QS]

It was not immediately clear which refiners agreed to buy the oil or the volume of the tender, but traders said the buyers included U.S. firms. Among the largest buyers of Venezuelan heavy crude in North America are Valero Energy Corp , Citgo Petroleum [PDVSAC.UL], Phillips 66 , Chevron Corp and PBF Energy Inc , according to Thomson Reuters data.

Rosneft, Chevron and Valero did not immediately respond to requests for comment. U.S. refiners Phillips 66 and PBF Energy declined to comment on commercial arrangements.

Some of these refiners recently have struggled to purchase Venezuelan oil directly from PDVSA as banks based in the United States have refused to extend the letters of credit the buyers need to complete imports from Venezuela. [nL2N1L31EK]

Rosneft's deliveries of Venezuelan oil will occur during September through December. The crude grades offered include diluted crude oil (DCO), a blend of extra heavy oil and heavy naphtha, according to the sources.

Russian oil firms Rosneft and Lukoil since May have received some 250,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude and refined products from Venezuela, according to the PDVSA's internal documents.

Venezuela's oil deliveries to the United States have declined in recent years amid falling production, commercial issues, and sanctions on Venezuelan officials. It has relied on deliveries to Russian oil firms to repay loans and swaps.

UPDATE 3-Chevron CEO Watson to step down, Wirth likely successor -source - Reuters News

{{20170822T223435.364+0000}}UPDATE 3-Chevron CEO Watson to step down, Wirth likely successor -source(Adds analyst comment and details on refining business)

By Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp Chief Executive John Watson will step down by the end of next month and likely be replaced by Vice Chairman Mike Wirth, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.

The unexpected shake-up at one of the world's largest oil and natural gas producers comes as pressure grows on the industry to further cut costs and control spending.

In Wirth, Chevron would pivot to a leader with experience in refining, where costs are regularly scrutinized down to the fraction of a penny.

The move would copy rival Exxon Mobil Corp , which earlier this year named refining expert Darren Woods as its own CEO, a step widely seen as prioritizing cash generation to protect payouts to shareholders above pricy exploration projects. [nL1N1E714O]

The CEOs of rivals Total and Royal Dutch Shell also have experience in refining.

Chevron's shares are up about 35 percent since Watson took over as CEO in January 2010, but the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> has more than doubled in that time. The company's shares are trading at the same level they were in early 2011.

Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson declined to comment. Neither Watson nor Wirth responded to requests for comment.

The California-based company is emerging from a global commodity price slump and is beginning to reap the fruits of a multibillion-dollar expansion spree.

The exit is not acrimonious and Watson sees it as an opportunity to hand over the reins of a growing enterprise to Wirth, according to the source.

"He may see it as a good time to step down and allow fresh management to take Chevron further," said Brendan Warn, an equity analyst with BMO Capital Markets, which advises clients to buy Chevron's stock.

The company's growth under Watson has not been painless. Chevron has struggled with cost overruns at two Australian liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, faced major engineering challenges at its U.S. Gulf of Mexico expansions, and is now contending with growing uncertainty about its operations in strife-torn Venezuela, where it is the only remaining major U.S. oil producer. [nL8N1IH3JO][nL2N1L31EK]

One of the Australian LNG projects has now come online, and the other is expected to by next month. Combined, the two are expected to fund half the company's dividend by 2019.

Watson made no major acquisitions during his leadership, ceding growth opportunities to rivals. Former Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson, for example, bought natural gas producer XTO Energy during his tenure and rapidly expanded into Qatar's LNG sector.

Watson, who has five years remaining before he hits Chevron's mandatory retirement age of 65, stuck to projects already in the planning stages when he became CEO in January 2010, rather than coming up with new deal or expansion ideas. Watson's predecessor, David O'Reilly, retired at 62.

The change at the top of the company, first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, did not shake markets. Shares of Chevron rose less than 1 percent to close at $106.36.

WIRTH'S EXPERIENCE

Watson is expected to stay on the company's board of directors for a period of time as Wirth grows into the CEO role, according to the source.

Like many of the company's executives, Watson has worked at Chevron his entire career and is the product of an internal talent development program.

"It would be hard to sit there and say that John Watson did a bad job as CEO," said Oliver Pursche of wealth manager Bruderman Brothers LLC, which holds shares in the company. "When we think about how Chevron has run its different business lines during the oil price slump, they've managed very well."

Wirth, 56, has been vice chairman since February and runs the company's pipeline division. He previously ran Chevron's refining unit, which has grown rapidly in recent years, with the company investing heavily in expansion and renovations. [nL2N1C91Z5]

Chevron last month posted higher-than-expected second-quarter profits on higher production and oil prices and lower spending on large projects.

Under Watson the company has been shifting additional resources to shale oil projects that promise quicker returns, but nearly all of that shale acreage has been in the company's portfolio since the 1930s. [nL1N1KJ0JB] [nL2N1HD00L]

Watson, an economist by training, rose through the company's ranks, served as its chief financial officer, and earlier oversaw the integration of Texaco operations following the 2000 acquisition.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Energy landscape is a battle for next Chevron CEO - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20170822T203303.625+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Energy landscape is a battle for next Chevron CEO(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Lauren Silva Laughlin

DALLAS, Aug 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Chevron is in the midst of changes. Chief Executive John Watson is planning to step down next month, according to Reuters, and he may be replaced by refining expert Michael Wirth. A new perspective may be warranted. Yet Chevron has weathered recent challenges decently. Any new boss, especially if home grown, will struggle with long-term industry headwinds.

If Wirth steps into the role Chevron will join rivals, including Exxon Mobil with its relatively new leader Darren Woods, in replacing old-school oil CEOs with people more familiar with downstream assets. With oil prices under pressure, the profitability of upstream drilling has dropped significantly. Oil chiefs have started to accept the idea that new discoveries and a shift of preferences and economics toward cleaner, more efficient, more climate-friendly sources of energy may prevent much in the way of increases. Last month Royal Dutch Shell boss Ben van Beurden said he wanted to ensure his company could handle "lower forever" oil prices if that's what materializes.

Chevron has felt the pain too. Revenue last year was only half of 2013's figure, and the company posted an annual loss. It has fared better than others, though, over both the long and short term. The company's stock price has increased roughly five percent over the last 10 years while competitors' shares have remained flat or fallen. Last quarter, Chevron's head start investing in the Permian shale in the United States started to pay off as it swung to profit and increased production.

Even so, earnings from downstream business were 40 percent bigger than those from upstream units last quarter. That poses longer term, structural problems. More than 80 percent of Chevron's assets are in upstream areas. The midstream business also depends on pulling hydrocarbons out of the ground. Whatever the focus on refining and the like, these other businesses still loom large.

The larger task for Chevron and rival oil majors is to rethink what being an energy company means. In one example, last week asset-management behemoth Vanguard, in a call with Reuters, said it would join other asset managers in asking companies to disclose more about the risks climate change poses, citing economics rather than ideology. It might take more than a different kind of oil-industry expertise to meet that kind of challenge.

GRAPHIC-Total overtakes Shell in North Sea where appetite for assets remains high - Reuters News

{{20170822T130744.769+0000}}GRAPHIC-Total overtakes Shell in North Sea where appetite for assets remains high* Majors still control three quarter of output

* After $10 bln of deals, private equity still plays modest role

* North Sea still generates good price due low political risks

By Dmitry Zhdannikov

LONDON, Aug 22 (Reuters) - French oil major Total has overtaken rival Royal Dutch Shell to become the second-largest producer in the North Sea with its acquisition of Maersk's Norwegian and UK producing assets.

The $7.45 billion deal by Total was welcomed by the market, with analysts saying it helped the French company rebalance its portfolio by adding assets in developed countries after going for projects in riskier places such as Iran and Russia. [nL8N1L70XF]

The deal boosts the share of eight global oil majors in the North Sea - Statoil, Total, Shell, Exxon Mobil , Conoco , ENI and Chevron - to back above three quarters of total output.

Several oil majors have been actively looking to divest fields in the North Sea - one of the most mature global oil provinces where future developments will be complicated by high decommissioning costs of old infrastructure.

Some assets have been bought by private equity firms which have expanded significantly in the region, with companies such as Chrysaor and Siccar acquiring fields from Shell, Austria's OMV and France's Engie. [nL8N1ID244] [nL5N1FL1B4] [nL8N1D976X]

But despite around $10 billion worth of deals in the North Sea over the past two years, private equity firms remain fairly small players with their total share still below 10 percent.

On Tuesday, UBS analysts upgraded Total to "Buy" from "Neutral" after the Maersk deal, saying Total bought the assets at an average price of $7.3 per barrel of oil resources, implying a long-term Brent price of $62 per barrel.

"In the context of a global asset market dominated by U.S. unconventional and Canadian oil sands transactions this year, a conventional offshore deal stands out as an anomaly," UBS said.

It said that opportunities for inorganic growth in the North Sea were beginning to diminish because EU utilities have fully divested of the upstream sector while oil majors have also largely sold out their non-core portfolios.

"The sale of another North Sea focused portfolio that was on the market, combined with Total's clear commitment to the basin, emphasises that competition for assets could remain high in spite of depressed oil prices," UBS said.

GLOBAL LNG-Prices rise slightly in quiet trading week - 路透新闻

{{20170818T180418.137+0000}}GLOBAL LNG-Prices rise slightly in quiet trading weekBy Oleg Vukmanovic and Mark Tay

LONDON/SINGAPORE, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Asian spot LNG prices largely levelled off this week following a strong run of gains over the past month as buyers took a break from replenishing stocks for winter.

Spot prices for October delivery rose 5 cents to $6.30 per million British thermal units (mmBtu).

In earlier weeks, a key source of demand related to some participants buying cargoes to meet obligations to consumers, but that type of activity also slowed.

Supply was offered from Malaysia and Indonesia, where the Donggi-Senoro plant made available a single cargo, while Angola LNG put two cargoes up for sale loading in late August, traders said.

China's Guanghui Energy has awarded part or all of its tender for 18 cargoes for delivery from September 2017 to December 2018, traders said.

Trading house Glencore will supply some of Guanghui's volumes, along with two other trading houses whose identities could not be immediately confirmed.

UPDATE 1-Australia puts multinationals on notice after Chevron drops tax appeal - Reuters News

{{20170818T062251.276+0000}}UPDATE 1-Australia puts multinationals on notice after Chevron drops tax appeal(Adds Chevron, tax office, government comments)

By Sonali Paul

MELBOURNE, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp has withdrawn an appeal to Australia's High Court over a disputed A$340 million ($268 million) tax bill, leaving in place a landmark court ruling on related-party loans that could affect other multinational companies.

"Chevron Australia has reached agreement with the Australian Taxation Office on the loan transfer pricing dispute and have withdrawn our appeal to the High Court," the company said in an emailed statement.

"Chevron believes the agreed terms are a reasonable resolution of the matter and are not expected to have a material impact on the year to date results of the company."

The oil and gas giant and the tax office declined to comment on the size of the settlement.

With the appeal withdrawn, a Federal Court ruling remains in place, which found Chevron had underpaid taxes by setting up a A$2.5 billion intercompany credit facility offshore with an abnormally high interest rate, effectively lowering its taxable income within Australia.

The tax office estimates the court's decision will result in more than A$10 billion in additional revenue being brought in over the next 10 years related to multinationals' transfer pricing of related-party financing alone, the government said.

"Not only does this result put more revenue back to the Australian people, it also strengthens the ATO's position in pursuing other arrangements where multinationals seek to dodge Australia's transfer pricing rules," Revenue and Financial Services minister Kelly O'Dwyer said in a statement.

Chevron did not say why it decided to drop its appeal to the nation's highest court. It lost an earlier appeal in Australia's Federal Court in April. The case covered the tax years from 2004 through 2008. [nL3N1HT1F9]

"The judgement in Chevron is one of the most important decisions in corporate tax in Australia," an Australian Taxation Office spokesman said in an emailed statement.

The closely watched case is a first test of how Australia's transfer pricing rules apply to interest paid on a cross-border related-party loan.

"We have been very clear that this case would have direct implications for a number of cases the ATO is currently pursuing in relation to related party loans, as well as indirect implications for other transfer pricing cases," the ATO spokesman said.

The tax office declined to name which companies it may pursue.

MEXICO CITY, Aug 17 (Reuters) - U.S. energy company Chevron Corp and trading firm Glencore on Thursday announced separate plans to enter Mexico's fuel market, as the long-hidebound sector begins to attract major foreign players.

Glencore expects to start importing fuel for Mexico's domestic market in February 2018 through its own terminal in the southern state of Tabasco, according to Alex Beard, the head of the firm's oil division.

"As soon as we have an opportunity to import through our own infrastructure in Tabasco, we will," Beard said at the inauguration of the first gas station branded under the franchise G500, created from a distribution partnership by Glencore and Corporacion G500, signed in May.

Chevron said in a statement it will import, distribute and sell refined products in partnership with a local gas station network it did not name. The company will shortly open its first gas station in Hermosillo, in northwest Mexico. [nE1N1KF025]

In subsequent weeks, Chevron expects to launch outlets in the states of Sonora, Sinaloa, Baja California and Baja California Sur, all of which are in the northwest of the country.

The liberalization of retail prices in Mexico has spurred business opportunities for large refining and trading companies who want to distribute and sell imported fuels.

The entry of big players is a boost for the government as its broad energy sector opening, which carved up state monopolies in oil, gas and electricity, begins to gain momentum.

Still, Mexico's fuel sector is not without its challenges, including widespread theft by violent gangs, often working in collusion with the employees of state-oil company Pemex.

PARTNERSHIP

Glencore said its fuel will ultimately be sold through a large network of 1,400 gas stations operated by Corporacion G500, formed in 2014 by independent station owners in response to Mexico's energy industry reform.

G500 sells around 160,000 barrels per day (bpd) of gasoline and diesel in several states of central Mexico through existing Pemex branded gas stations, representing around 12 percent of the country's service stations.

U.S. refiners, including Valero Energy Corp and Andeavor , formerly known as Tesoro Corp, have also announced plans to participate in Mexico's fuel market. Local mining and infrastructure company Grupo Mexico is building new terminals to discharge independent fuel imports and later distribute it by rail.

Pemex remains the largest importer, distributor and seller of fuels in Mexico.

UPDATE 1-Oil producers signal offshore return in latest Gulf of Mexico auction - Reuters News

{{20170816T181130.027+0000}}UPDATE 1-Oil producers signal offshore return in latest Gulf of Mexico auction(Adds statement from Wood Mackenzie analyst)

By Liz Hampton

HOUSTON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Major oil producers pushed up high bids at a Gulf of Mexico offshore auction to $121 million on Wednesday, a nearly seven-fold increase from a year ago, as their return to deep water exploration gained momentum.

This compared with $18 million in high bids at the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's (BOEM) Outer Continental Shelf auction last summer.

Winners will be announced after a 90-day review.

Some producers have signaled that they expect Gulf of Mexico projects to become more profitable now that they have trimmed operations to adapt to low oil prices. Offshore drilling typically requires higher prices for producers to break even.

Royal Dutch Shell claimed the largest number of blocks, with 19 high bids valued at a combined $25.1 million. Chevron Corp followed with 15 high bids totaling $27.9 million. Anadarko Petroleum Corp won 10 blocks for $10.6 million. Exxon Mobil Corp took seven blocks of land for $20.4 million.

Most of the bids were for deep water blocks, at depths of more than 1,600 meters. The auction drew interest from 27 oil companies, with 99 bids on 90 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico, according to the BOEM.

"The deepwater industry is emphasizing short-cycle, low-risk prospects above high-impact, wildcat drilling," said William Turner, a senior analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

Some bids by Chevron, Shell and Total were "a vote of confidence in higher-risk, standalone, developments with potential for higher rewards," he added.

The auction offered 14,177 blocks totaling 75.9 million acres, but only 508,000 received bids, according to the BOEM. This year's auction covered Western, Central and Eastern areas of the gulf. The year-earlier auction was only for the Western region.

The sale offered nearly 76 million acres of land off the shores of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida.

A sale of offshore blocks in March attracted $275 million in winning bids, a similar surge from a year ago.

Wednesday's sale was the first of 10 planned as part of the new Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program for 2017 to 2022.

U.S. benchmark oil prices have held stubbornly below $50 a barrel for much of this year, despite efforts by global producers to curb production and boost prices.

Many parts of the Gulf of Mexico need oil above $50 a barrel for producers to cover costs, with the deepest parts of the Gulf requiring around $65 a barrel to break-even, according to Wood Mackenize.

Venezuela ships more oil to U.S. in July vs June, but less than yr ago - Reuters News

{{20170814T204550.677+0000}}Venezuela ships more oil to U.S. in July vs June, but less than yr agoBy Marianna Parraga

Aug 14 (Reuters) - Venezuela's PDVSA and its joint ventures last month shipped 638,325 barrels per day (bpd) of crude to the United States, a 30 percent increase over June due to larger sales of upgraded oil, according to Thomson Reuters trade flows data.

Venezuelan crude output has declined this year to its lowest point in 27 years due to a lack of investment and payment delays to oil service firms, affecting exports to customers in key markets including the United States.

Even though the volume of crude sent to the United States in July was larger than the previous month, it was 22 percent below the same month in 2016.

The main U.S. receiver of Venezuelan crude last month was refiner Valero Energy , followed by PDVSA's refining unit in the United States, Citgo Petroleum [PDVSAC.UL].

PDVSA earlier this year signed a refinancing agreement with Russian energy giant Rosneft that has diverted more oil to that firm, and fewer volumes to Citgo. [nL1N1KM1Z8]

But Citgo has requested more upgraded crude from joint ventures between PDVSA and its foreign partners in the Orinoco Belt, which has partially compensated for lower supplies from its parent company. Upgraded oils are those that have been treated at special facilities built to process extra heavy crude from Venzeuela's largest oil-producing region.

Another prominent buyer of Venezuelan crude in the United States, refining firm Phillips 66 , did not receive crude supplies from PDVSA last month, according to the data.

U.S.-based PBF Energy , Marathon Petroleum , Valero and Phillips 66 have reduced their purchases of heavy oil in recent weeks due to less barrels available from Venezuela and other OPEC producers, which is narrowing spreads between heavy Latin American crudes and lighter grades.

LONDON/SINGAPORE, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Asian spot LNG prices gained ground this week with traders and portfolio players engaged in short-covering as sputtering output and stockpiling ahead of winter added to bullish sentiment.

Spot prices for September delivery rose to $6.20 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), 30 cents above last week. LNG for October traded at a five cent premium.

The week's big tender award came from Russia's Sakhalin II plant, providing a shipment to Shell, Gazprom and Mitsui at some $6.30 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). [nL5N1KX4C3]

Relatively high bid levels for the Sakhalin II cargoes - all loading in October - reflect efforts by suppliers to cover short positions, some traders said.

Shell in particular has been stung by export disruptions from Peru and an unplanned outage hitting its Queensland Curtis plant in Australia, which now appears to be back in operation. The resulting supply shortfall forced it into spot markets.

An unexpected pick-up in autumn demand across Asia, fuelled by hot weather and stockpiling ahead of the winter by some buyers, also helped to lift spot prices.

Two more upcoming maintenance outages at Australian projects - Chevron's Gorgon and Woodside Petroleum's North West Shelf (NWS) - where Shell is an off-taker of LNG, might extend its reliance on spot markets, some traders said.

The NWS outage in September could not be confirmed, however.

South Korea's LNG imports rose to seasonal highs between May and July as the country took advantage of depressed off-peak prices to stockpile the supercooled fuel, a move that may dent its upcoming winter demand. [nL4N1KX1VV]

"Korea's June LNG imports were higher than usual because it bought a lot of LNG strategically to take advantage of lower prices ... Korean LNG buyers made purchases in advance to store it up ahead of peak demand season," said an official at the energy ministry who declined to be named because he is not authorised to speak to the media.

Trafigura purchased an Angolan cargo that loaded on Aug. 7-9, traders said. [nL5N1KX1VE]

Trinidad's Atlantic LNG facility expects to soon resume production from the plant's third production line that was shut last week after a gas leak. [nL5N1KV49H]

Meanwhile, Argentina launched two tenders seeking up to 32 shipments for delivery over the next year under terms allowing it to cancel most deliveries if spot prices at the time prove more favourable. [nL5N1KT4HY]

One trading source said the unusual terms curbed interest from suppliers unwilling to hand Enarsa a free option to cancel cargoes. Another said the cancellation risk would be baked into higher offers submitted by suppliers.

Nigeria offered new supply and the latest production line at Cheniere Energy's Sabine Pass facility, known as Train 4, was due to export its first commissioning cargo this week.

SPECIAL REPORT-Vladimir's Venezuela: Leveraging loans to Caracas, Moscow snaps up oil assets - 路透新闻

By Marianna Parraga and Alexandra Ulmer

Caracas/Houston, Aug 11 (Reuters) - Venezuela's unraveling socialist government is increasingly turning to ally Russia for the cash and credit it needs to survive – and offering prized state-owned oil assets in return, sources familiar with the negotiations told Reuters.

As Caracas struggles to contain an economic meltdown and violent street protests, Moscow is using its position as Venezuela's lender of last resort to gain more control over the OPEC nation's crude reserves, the largest in the world.

Venezuela's state-owned oil firm, Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), has been secretly negotiating since at least early this year with Russia's biggest state-owned oil company, Rosneft - offering ownership interests in up to nine of Venezuela's most productive petroleum projects, according to a top Venezuelan government official and two industry sources familiar with the talks. [nL2N1GT1M4]

Moscow has substantial leverage in the negotiations: Cash from Russia and Rosneft has been crucial in helping the financially strapped government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro avoid a sovereign debt default or a political coup.

Rosneft delivered Venezuela's state-owned firm more than $1 billion in April alone in exchange for a promise of oil shipments later. On at least two occasions, the Venezuelan government has used Russian cash to avoid imminent defaults on payments to bondholders, a high-level PDVSA official told Reuters.

Rosneft has also positioned itself as a middleman in sales of Venezuelan oil to customers worldwide. Much of it ends up at refineries in the United States – despite U.S. sanctions against Russia – because it is sold through intermediaries such as oil trading firms, according to internal PDVSA trade reports seen by Reuters and a source at the firm.

PDVSA and the government of Venezuela did not respond to requests for comment.

The Russian government declined to comment and referred questions to the foreign ministry and the ministries of finance and defense, which did not respond to questions from Reuters. Rosneft declined to comment.

Russia's growing control over Venezuelan crude gives it a stronger foothold in energy markets across the Americas. Rosneft now resells about 225,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuelan oil - about 13 percent of the nation's total exports, according to the PDVSA trade reports. That's about enough to satisfy the daily demand of a country the size of Peru.

Venezuela gives Rosneft most of that oil as payment for billions of dollars in cash loans that Maduro's government has already spent. His administration needs Russia's money to finance everything from bond payments to imports of food and medicine amid severe national shortages.

Venezuela's opposition lawmakers say Russia is behaving more like a predator than an ally.

"Rosneft is definitely taking advantage of the situation," said Elias Matta, vice president of the energy commission at Venezuela's elected National Assembly. "They know this is a weak government; that it's desperate for cash - and they're sharks."

Matta echoed many others in the opposition-majority congress who have blasted corporate deals they say are underpinning Maduro's efforts to establish a dictatorship.

The Venezuelan government has said previously that Russia's investment in its oil industry shows confidence in PDVSA's financial stability and the nation's business opportunities.

Maduro's administration has grown increasingly dependent on Moscow in the past two years as China has curtailed credit to Venezuela because of payment delays and the corruption and crime faced by Chinese firms operating there, according to Venezuelan debt analysts and two oil industry sources.

Many multinational firms worldwide, meanwhile, have all but written off their Venezuelan operations amid the nation's tanking economy and chronic shortages of raw materials.

Rosneft is making the opposite play - using Venezuela's hard times as a buying opportunity for oil assets with potentially high long-term value.

"The Russians are catching Venezuela at rock bottom," said one Western diplomat who has worked on issues involving Venezuela's oil industry in recent years.

As other companies shutter operations here, Rosneft has expanded to an additional floor of its office tower and added staff. The Russian firm has poached PDVSA professionals and brought in more Russian executives, two sources close to Rosneft told Reuters.

The corporate expansion provides a striking contrast to the scene on the streets below these days, in the once-thriving business district of Caracas.

As Rosneft staffers work in swanky offices alongside posters of Russian President Vladimir Putin and a bust of Hugo Chavez - the late Venezuelan leader and socialist icon - crowds of young men outside often throw rocks and Molotov cocktails in escalating protests of Chavez' successor.

Rosneft currently owns substantial portions of five major Venezuelan oil projects. The additional projects PDVSA is now offering the Russian firm include five in the Orinoco - Venezuela's largest oil producing region – along with three in Maracaibo Lake, its second-largest and oldest producing area, and a shallow-water oil project in the Paria Gulf, the two industry sources told Reuters.

In a separate proposal first reported by Reuters last month, Rosneft would swap its collateral on 49.9 percent of Citgo [PDVSAC.UL] – the Venezuelan owned, U.S.-based refiner – for stakes in three additional PDVSA oil fields, two natural gas fields and a lucrative fuel supply contract, according to two sources with knowledge of the negotiations.

Under the proposal, Rosneft would also take increased management control over all the joint oil projects between the two firms. [nL1N1KB28X]

Rosneft secured the collateral late last year on a loan of $1.5 billion to PDVSA.

The negotiations over a collateral swap are driven in part by a recent threat from U.S. President Donald Trump to sanction Venezuela's oil sector as punishment for Maduro's efforts to undermine the nation's elected congress.

Rosneft has already been sanctioned by the United States over Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Such actions require U.S. firms to end business relations with sanctioned entities.

RUSSIAN OIL DEALS UNDERMINE DEMOCRACY

Maduro's need for Russian cash played a key role in a move by his political allies earlier this year that destabilized Venezuela's already teetering democracy, the top Venezuelan government official told Reuters.

In March, the nation's Supreme Court - whose members are loyal to Maduro - took over the powers of the opposition-controlled National Assembly. A majority of elected Assembly members opposed any new oil deals with Russia and insisted on retaining power to veto them.

Days later - after fierce national protests against the action - the court returned most powers to the national legislature at Maduro's public urging. But the court allowed the president to keep the legal authority to cut fresh oil deals with Russia without legislative approval. [nL2N1HA018]

The episode was pivotal in escalating daily street protests and clashes with authorities that have since caused more than 120 deaths.

Maduro needed sole authority to cut new oil deals to clear the way for Rosneft's expansion, the top Venezuelan government official told Reuters.

"Pressure from Russia has played an important role in Nicolas Maduro's decisions," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to make public comments.

Rosneft said this month that it has lent a total of $6 billion to PDVSA. In total, Russia and Rosneft have delivered Venezuela at least $17 billion in loans and credit lines since 2006, according to Reuters calculations based on loans and credit lines announced by the government.

Venezuela does not publish the full details of the debts it owes Russia.

Maduro has sought to limit the power of congress since the opposition won a majority in 2015.

In late July, he created a legislative superbody called the Constituent Assembly in an election that was widely criticized as a sham. Allies of the Socialist Party won all 545 seats in the new assembly, which has the power to rewrite the nation's constitution, dissolve state institutions - such as the opposition-run Congress - and fire dissident state officials.

SPIRAL OF DEBT, DEPENDENCE

Venezuela's oil-based economy has collapsed since international prices crashed to a low of $24 per barrel in early 2016 from more than $100 in 2014. Prices now hover at about $50, which hasn't proven high enough to pull Venezuela out of its tailspin.

Nearly all of the nation's export revenue comes from oil, so income has fallen sharply and a shortage of petrodollars has left Maduro's government unable to finance the generous subsidies of food, medicines, fuels, power and other public services instituted by his predecessor, Chavez.

The erosion of subsidies has contributed to rapid inflation, which is forecasted to top 700 percent this year by the International Monetary Fund. Venezuela's currency, the bolivar, has become nearly worthless.

Government spending cuts have also slashed budgets for maintaining the nation's oilfields, refineries, ports and tankers, causing Venezuela's oil output in the first half of 2017 to fall to nearly its lowest level in 27 years.

PDVSA is repaying a growing portion of its mounting debts to Russia with oil, according to internal PDVSA trade data reviewed by Reuters. The oil payments are choking off the cash flow from its petroleum business - thereby creating the need for more loans.

CIRCLING OIL ASSETS

The nation's downward spiral has put Rosneft in a position to acquire Venezuelan oil assets on the cheap.

Of the package of stakes PDVSA has offered to Rosneft, the most valuable is a 10 percent stake in Petropiar, a multi-billion dollar project to produce and upgrade extra heavy crude in the Orinoco Belt.

The value of the stake is likely between $600 million and $800 million, based on the valuations of similar deals.

The rising volumes of Venezuelan crude that Rosneft receives have made the Russian firm a middleman in sales to refiners that once bought directly from PDVSA. The oil payments have also helped Rosneft grow a major oil trading business to complement its massive production apparatus.

In the process, the Russian firm has appropriated some of PDVSA's hard-won international supply deals and valuable trading relationships with refiners as far afield as China, the PDVSA documents show.

At today's prices, the Venezuelan oil exports that flow to Rosneft would be worth about $3.6 billion annually. And the flow of PDVSA crude to Rosneft is expected to keep increasing, according to the internal PDVSA documents.

Most of it is sold into the United States, according to the documents.

Rosneft also will soon start selling Venezuelan crude to India's refiner Essar, taking PDVSA's second largest customer in the Asian country. [nL2N1GL06O]

"Russia is taking everything they have," said an oil trader who regularly deals with PDVSA.

A DICEY INVESTMENT

The Russian strategy has its risks. Many of the world's top energy firms took a hit when Chavez nationalized their assets, and an opposition-led government could later reverse or revise any deals Maduro cuts without their blessing.

Venezuela's bond yields are among the highest in the world because of the nation's high default risk. The bonds pay nearly 30 percentage points more than benchmark U.S. treasuries.

PDVSA's many connections to the United States oil industry also raise the specter that the deals now under negotiation could run afoul of U.S. economic sanctions already in place against Russia and threatened against Venezuela.

The Petropiar project, for instance, is 30 percent owned by U.S. oil major Chevron Corp .

Should Rosneft take a stake in the project, it could be complicated for Chevron to ensure it is not violating U.S. sanctions. In the meantime, Chevron has sent guidelines to executives to ensure they comply with sanctions, an employee at Chevron told Reuters.

The guidelines advise staff, for instance, to avoid one-on-one meetings with sanctioned entities or officials, the employee said. In a statement, Chevron said it abides by "a stringent code of business ethics" and complies with applicable laws.

For now, Russia's status as chief lender to PDVSA has put Rosneft in a position to supercharge its holdings and profits in the region.

If Venezuela's government defaults on its debt payments - an increasingly likely scenario - Rosneft likely will be one of the entities at the front of the queue as a creditor because of its large collateral stake in U.S.-based Citgo, according to a confidential independent analysis of its debt commissioned by an investment fund and seen by Reuters.

Representatives of Citgo, PDVSA'S largest foreign asset, did not respond to requests for comment.

GUNS FOR OIL

Rosneft's involvement in Venezuela can be traced back to a $4 billion arms-for-oil deal in 2006 that cemented the bond between the governments of Chavez and Putin. Chavez, a former military officer, signed the deal himself in Moscow.

Shunned by the United States - which since 2006 has refused to supply spare parts for Venezuela's fleet of U.S.-built F-16 fighter jets - Chavez bought Russian Sukhoi fighter jets, helicopters, tanks and guns from Putin.

Top executives from Rosneft and PDVSA were later involved in negotiations related to the military purchases because Rosneft was the Russian entity receiving the Venezuelan oil cargoes used to pay for a portion of the weapons, the top Venezuelan government official told Reuters.

They included Rosneft President Igor Sechin, a powerful long-time advisor and deputy to Putin. Sechin is a trained linguist who began his career as a military interpreter and has a passion for the history of Latin America's revolutionaries, according to two people who worked with him.

He had a direct line into Chavez until the former president's death in 2013, the Venezuelan official told Reuters. Sechin has maintained close ties with Maduro and the two meet regularly, the official said.

Speaking to reporters in at a hydroelectric plant in Russia last week, Sechin called Rosneft's growing investments in Venezuela an obvious and essential play.

"This is a country with the world's hydrocarbon reserves," he said, referring to a central component of oil and natural gas. "Any energy company should aim to work in this country ... No one could force us from there."

Russia was swift to defend Maduro's government from international criticism after the Supreme Court moved to nullify congress, with Moscow issuing a statement saying foreign governments should not meddle in Venezuelan domestic politics.

Sechin was Maduro's guest of honor at a ceremony last October to unveil a Russian-made granite statue of Chavez erected in the late president's hometown of Sabaneta.

In the sweltering heat, a Russian choir dressed in black sang the Venezuelan anthem in heavily accented Spanish before Sechin addressed the crowds of mostly red-shirted Socialist Party supporters.

"Thank you for trusting us," Sechin told the crowd in Spanish during the speech, broadcast on Venezuelan state television. "Russia and Venezuela, together forever!"

He had a direct line into Chavez until the former president's death in 2013, the Venezuelan official told Reuters. Sechin has maintained close ties with Maduro and the two meet regularly, the official said.

Speaking to reporters in at a hydroelectric plant in Russia last week, Sechin called Rosneft's growing investments in Venezuela an obvious and essential play.

"This is a country with the world's hydrocarbon reserves," he said, referring to a central component of oil and natural gas. "Any energy company should aim to work in this country ... No one could force us from there."

Russia was swift to defend Maduro's government from international criticism after the Supreme Court moved to nullify congress, with Moscow issuing a statement saying foreign governments should not meddle in Venezuelan domestic politics.

Sechin was Maduro's guest of honor at a ceremony last October to unveil a Russian-made granite statue of Chavez erected in the late president's hometown of Sabaneta.

In the sweltering heat, a Russian choir dressed in black sang the Venezuelan anthem in heavily accented Spanish before Sechin addressed the crowds of mostly red-shirted Socialist Party supporters.

"Thank you for trusting us," Sechin told the crowd in Spanish during the speech, broadcast on Venezuelan state television. "Russia and Venezuela, together forever!"

UPDATE 1-S.Korea's GS Caltex shuts heavy oil upgrading unit after fire - Reuters News

{{20170810T052846.552+0000}}UPDATE 1-S.Korea's GS Caltex shuts heavy oil upgrading unit after fire(Adds details of the unit's capacity and background)

SEOUL, Aug 10 (Reuters) - GS Caltex, South Korea's second-largest oil refinery, said it has shut a heavy oil upgrading unit after a fire mishap on Thursday.

The blaze, which is now under control, broke out in the heavy oil upgrading unit or Vacuum Residue Hydrocracker (VRHCR), at GS Caltex's Yeosu refinery, located in southwest of Seoul.

GS Caltex has a combined 274,000 barrels-per-day of heavy oil upgrading capacity to convert fuel oil into more expensive and cleaner fuel such as gasoline and diesel.

The fire hit the refiner's 66,000-bpd hydrocracker, the spokesman said.

No casualties have been reported, the spokesman said, adding that the cause and damage to the unit were still being assessed.

He said it was too early to tell if there would be any impact on the refinery's operations.

A week ago, GS Caltex shut its No.2 Aromatics plant after a fire occurred at an electrical substation in the refinery. [nL4N1KO2PC]

After a few disappointments, Statoil to drill biggest Arctic hope - Reuters News

{{20170807T150013.979+0000}}After a few disappointments, Statoil to drill biggest Arctic hopeOSLO, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Norway's Statoil will soon start drilling this season's most promising Arctic prospect, Korpfjell, after several disappointing wells in the Barents Sea, the company said on Monday.

The majority state-owned company has stepped up drilling in the Barents Sea this year as the government seeks to attract more explorers to its Arctic waters to make up for declining North Sea output. [nO9N1HC00G]

The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate said on Monday Statoil's latest well in the Barents Sea, Gemini North, had found only minor volumes of gas and oil. [nEON161UH4]

"The well was drilled with the ambition of proving up additional oil resources in the vicinity of the Wisting discovery, but like the previous Blaamann well, we discovered gas," said Jez Averty, senior vice president for exploration in Norway and the UK.

The Kayak well drilled in June proved to have between 25 and 50 million barrels of oil, too small for a stand-alone development. [nO9N1CA03I]

Statoil said on Monday it would next drill the Korpfjell prospect near the Russian border, more than 400 kilometres away from the mainland.

"(Statoil's) drilling campaign wasn't a huge success so far, but Korpfjell is the most important well out of the five planned this year in the Barents Sea," Teodor Sveen-Nilsen, an analyst at Sparebank1 Markets, said.

Statoil described Korpfjell as a high-impact well, meaning it could provide a total of more than 250 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) or 100 million boe net for Statoil.

Sweden's Lundin Petroleum , Statoil's partner in the license, estimates Korpfjell could hold more than 1 billion boe, based on seismic surveys.

Other partners in the license are Chevron , ConocoPhillips and Norway's Petoro.

UPDATE 1-Nigeria's state oil company signs deals with Chevron, Shell - Reuters News

{{20170803T140432.461+0000}}UPDATE 1-Nigeria's state oil company signs deals with Chevron, Shell(Adds details, background)

LAGOS, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Nigeria's state oil company said on Thursday it had signed financing agreements with Chevron and Shell worth at least $780 million to boost crude production and reserves.

The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) said a joint venture agreement with Chevron Nigeria Limited would see the development of proven and probable reserves of 211 million barrels at the joint Sonam project.

"The project is expected to begin to bear fruits in (the) next three and six months," NNPC said in a statement, adding it was targeting production of 39,000 barrels per day of liquids and 283 million standard cubic feet of gas per day.

It also said a joint venture with Shell Petroleum Development Company would lead to the development of a project comprising of 156 development activities across 12 oil mining licences in the Niger Delta oil hub.

NNPC said the deal with Chevron would provide the $780 million needed to complete the Sonam project on which the U.S. company has already spent $1.5 billion.

NNPC said the project with Shell, called Santolina, required third-party funding of $1 billion, without saying whether this was covered by the deal.

The OPEC producer has struggled to fund its part of joint ventures with foreign partners through so called cash-calls which often got delayed in parliament.

Nigeria has been since last year holding talks with oil majors over new finance agreements for joint ventures.

European oil majors seek to harness U.S. offshore wind - Reuters News

{{20170801T095756.002+0000}}European oil majors seek to harness U.S. offshore wind* Statoil, Shell, DONG Energy turn to U.S. offshore wind

* Oil firms bring big budgets, offshore tech and risk experience

* Projects will need major investment, supply chains

By Karolin Schaps and Susanna Twidale

LONDON, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Some European oil majors have made inroads into the emerging U.S. offshore wind energy market, aiming to leverage their experience of deepwater development and the crowded offshore wind arena at home.

Late entrants to the offshore wind game in Europe, which began with a project off Denmark 25 years ago and is now approaching maturity, they are looking across the Atlantic at what they view as a huge and potentially lucrative new market.

Norway's Statoil has won a licence to develop a wind farm of the New York coast, is marketing its new floating turbine to California and Hawaii and is retraining some oil and gas staff to work in its wind division.

Royal Dutch Shell bid for a lease offshore North Carolina earlier this year while Denmark's DONG Energy, a wind energy pioneer which agreed to sell its oil and gas business in May, is in a Massachusetts-based offshore wind consortium, holds a lease off the New Jersey coast and has opened an office in Boston.

Offshore wind generation began in the United States late last year, ironically after the election of President Donald Trump. He is sceptical about climate change, complains about subsidies for renewable energy and battled against an offshore wind farm near his Scottish golf resort.

However, a string of federal seabed leases were awarded before Trump took office and more are planned. [L5N1KM40R] The investment needed to get projects going is one of the biggest obstacles.

"Undeniably, offshore wind is a big boys' game because it requires large amounts of capital because scale is such an important cost driver," said Samuel Leupold chief executive of DONG Energy's offshore wind business.

While DONG has shifted decisively towards renewables, Statoil and Shell are still firmly rooted in fossil fuels and other major European oil companies, in common with their U.S. counterparts, have so far steered clear of U.S. offshore wind.

Washington estimates its potential at 2,000 gigawatts (GW), many times anticipated capacity in Europe of 25 GW by 2020, but U.S. federal subsidies expire at the end of 2019 and while they may be renewed by Congress, that is no means certain.

Costs in Europe have fallen to a level that enabled DONG to place a zero subsidy bid earlier this year, but offshore wind farms are still multi-billion dollar projects. A push into deeper U.S. waters and the bigger turbines needed to compete without subsidies will keep price tags high.[nL8N1JJ2OL]

EARLY DAYS

Trump signed an executive order in March expected to roll back his predecessor Barack Obama's plan requiring states to slash carbon emissions from power plants. There is also no carbon price mechanism across the United States like those in Europe and elsewhere, although there are two regional ones.

U.S. oil companies have some investments in solar and onshore wind, but when it comes to offshore wind, many say they are waiting for a time when government support is not needed.

"Chevron supports renewables that are scalable and can compete without subsidies," said Morgan Krinklaw, a spokesman for Chevron, which owns an onshore wind farm.

A report from analysts at Lazard in December pegged the cost of U.S. offshore wind at $118 MWh, around twice as much as onshore wind or combined-cycle gas turbines.

Asked to comment on that figure, Statoil, which is building its first floating wind turbine park off the Scottish coast, said costs were coming down and it was working to drive them down further, partly by redeploying existing staff.

The company has about 1,000 employees in the U.S. oil industry, said Stephen Bull, senior vice president of the company's wind business. "There's scope for us to plug into our existing oil and gas supply chain," he added, referring to existing contracts with equipment and service suppliers.

Statoil spokeswoman Elin Isaksen said she did not expect any of its offshore wind projects in the U.S. to have begun construction by 2019 and that it was too early to quote numbers for the New York project, while acknowledging there was, as yet, no supply chain.

"We expect to see – and will help - the supply chain evolve rapidly in step with the broader industry as offshore wind takes hold in the U.S. in the coming years," she said.

In Virginia, where Spanish utility Iberdrola's Avangrid has secured an offshore wind licence, a rich marine engineering heritage is expected to help local companies gain work. Smaller European oil and gas firms are also gaining work.

JDR Cable Systems, a British company that has traditionally supplied subsea power lines to oil and gas platforms, earlier this year won a $275 million contract to provide electric cables for the largest U.S. offshore wind farm off the Maryland coast.

"We are well placed to develop business in the U.S. because of the existing relationships we have in Europe," said John Price, global sales director for renewables at JDR.

State level decision-making on electricity procurement, the next stage of getting offshore wind off the ground, is helping.

Massachusetts, where DONG has secured a seabed license, last year issued a law requiring its utilities to buy up to 1.6 GW of offshore wind power by June 2027, with a tender to be held later this year.

DONG's North America wind power president Thomas Bostrom said it would bid in the Massachusetts power purchase tender in December and would not comment on costs ahead of that. He too, emphasised his company was playing the long game.

"As excited as we are for offshore wind in the U.S., we are still in the early days of the industry," Bostrom said.

BREAKINGVIEWS-U.S. sanctions on Venezuela a double-edged sword  - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20170731T161855.505+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-U.S. sanctions on Venezuela a double-edged sword (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Anastasia Chacon Gonzalez

WASHINGTON, July 31 (Reuters Breakingviews) - President Nicolas Maduro said Sunday's vote for a new Constituent Assembly would bring peace to the country, but the immediate impact is likely to be expanded U.S. sanctions. Fresh trade measures by Washington may embolden opposition to Maduro, including from the military. That offers hope for Venezuelans, but American companies like Phillips 66 and Chevron would share the costs.

Members of the new legislative super-body elected on Sunday will have the authority to rewrite the constitution and to override the opposition-controlled National Assembly, strengthening the Socialist president's grip on power. The administration of President Donald Trump, which last week imposed sanctions on 13 of Maduro's closest allies, has threatened to respond by targeting the South American country's oil sector with new restrictions.

Oil generates 95 percent of Venezuela's export income and the United States is the largest cash-generating market for state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL]. A cut in oil revenue would further tighten the government's budget for basic necessities and increase the risk of Venezuela defaulting on its foreign debt this year. Both dynamics would exacerbate social instability and could prompt the military – reluctant to use excessive violence against civilians, and keen to maintain its own dollar inflows – to reconsider its loyalty to Maduro and force him to negotiate a transfer of power.

Venezuela is the third-largest supplier of crude oil to the United States, providing an average of 741,000 barrels a day last year, according to the Energy Information Administration. U.S. companies such as Phillips 66 and Chevron, which respectively took 18.5 percent and 13.1 percent of Venezuelan crude exports in 2016, will feel the impact if Washington interrupts that trade.

Even if new sanctions prohibit only exports to Venezuela, U.S. oil companies would have a lot to lose. Venezuela bought 75,000 barrels a day of light crude from the United States in 2016, or nearly 15 percent of American exports. PDVSA mixes that with its heavy crude to make it commercially viable. American refineries that sell to Venezuela would have to find alternative customers.

The U.S. oil industry is already facing the costs of government sanctions against Russia and Iran. Economic measures against Venezuela might bring diplomatic success, but it would surely come at an additional price.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Venezuelans on July 30 elected members of a new Constituent Assembly backed by President Nicolas Maduro's ruling Socialist Party that will have authority to rewrite the constitution and override the opposition-led National Assembly. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley called the vote a "sham election" that marked "another step toward dictatorship."

- President Donald Trump previously threatened "strong and swift economic actions" against Maduro if he followed through with the election. His administration has not ruled out any options, including a ban on trade or banking activity between Venezuelan and American companies.

- On July 28, the United States imposed sanctions on 13 of Maduro's closest associates, including members of the government, the military and PDVSA, the state oil company. The measure froze the officials' assets in the United States.

- The two countries' oil sectors are closely linked. The United States is PDVSA's largest cash-generating export market, and the South American country is the third-largest U.S. crude oil supplier.
