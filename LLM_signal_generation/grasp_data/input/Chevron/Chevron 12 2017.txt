Colonial Pipeline defends fees to U.S. watchdog after shippers complain - 路透新闻

{{20171222T233151.827+0000}}Colonial Pipeline defends fees to U.S. watchdog after shippers complainNEW YORK, Dec 22 (Reuters)

By Devika Krishna Kumar

NEW YORK, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Colonial Pipeline Co, the largest U.S. fuel network, defended the fees it charges to ship gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, saying on Friday a formal complaint by some of its biggest customers was based on "purposefully manipulated" financial data.

In a November complaint filed with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), affiliates of Chevron, Valero and Delta Air Lines said Colonial's rates were excessive and unreasonable, and accused it of effectively monopolizing the New York market.[nL1N1O81I4]

The complaint alleged that Colonial's opaque fee structure pushed its 2016 interstate revenue to exceed its costs by $339.3 million, earning it about a 29 percent realized return on equity, an increase of about 44 percent from 1991.

In a filing to FERC, Colonial said that figure is inaccurate, and there is only a difference of 2.5 percent between Colonial's costs and revenues, a figure well below the level U.S. regulators have found to warrant further investigation.

It said contrary to FERC regulations, Chevron, Valero and Delta's trading arms excluded non-recurring costs in their calculations, such as those incurred after outages due to a leak and an explosion in 2016.

Without such adjustments, the rate of return on equity fell by 18 percent, Colonial said, rather than rising 44 percent.

In their complaint, the three companies argue that Colonial overcharged them by more than $60 million combined and is potentially monopolizing fuel delivery into the New York region, the largest demand hub in the United States.

If FERC holds a hearing and rates are ultimately lowered, it could be the most significant change to Colonial's rate structure in nearly 20 years.

The pipeline hauls more than 3 million barrels of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from the refinery hub in the Gulf Coast to centers in the northeast every day. Even with the current fees, it remains the cheapest and most efficient way to haul fuel across the country to those markets.

Colonial was allowed to charge market-based rates in 2001 to deliver fuel into the New York area, on the understanding that it did not posses monopoly power over those markets.

The complaint alleges Colonial's rates have not been reviewed in recent years and warrant investigation in part due to the changes in market conditions.

Colonial said on Friday that a 2015 FERC audit, which covered a period from 2011 to 2014, showed no findings related to its grandfathered rates, indexed rates or market-based rates.

Colonial currently charges about $2.20 a barrel to ship fuel from Houston, Texas to the New York area.

"The complainants knowingly and purposefully manipulated and cherry-picked data from various different public filings over a course of several years to mix and match numbers to make their case," Colonial said in a statement. "That's not how this process works."

U.S. refiner Phillips 66 , another shipper on Colonial Pipeline, filed a request to intervene in the proceeding last week. Others including Flint Hills Resources LP, Castleton Commodities, TransMontaigne Partners LP, Marathon Petroleum and World Fuel Services filed motions to intervene this week.

"At this time, we are not taking a position and we do not plan on submitting comments unless specific questions arise concerning our interests that warrant a response," Flint Hills spokesman Jake Reint said in an emailed statement.

It was not immediately clear whether the other companies would be for or against Colonial Pipeline.

BUZZ- Oil Services ETF tries to cap off the year looking well - 路透新闻

{{20171221T191931.557+0000}}BUZZ- Oil Services ETF tries to cap off the year looking well** It's been a rough year for oil services stocks. Indeed, into mid-Dec, VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF was on track for its worst pct loss in its 7-year history

** However, its near 6 pct WTD rally enough to avert that distinction, potentially set OIH up for further gains

** Even with this week's rally, OIH still down 22.6 pct YTD. This with NYMEX Crude futures up 8.3 YTD, while NYMEX Nat Gas has lost 30 pct

** OIH underperforming other energy related ETFs in 2017: VanEck Vectors Unconventional Oil & Gas ETF down 16 pct, while Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund off 4.5 pct

** Refining stocks have been winners; VanEck Vectors Oil Refiners ETF up 45.4 pct, even beating out tech in 2017 (Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund up 33.9 pct) [nL1N1OL0Q1] [nL1N1OJ0P2]

** Meanwhile, U.S. refiners and pipeline cos likely to embark on capital spending spree in next year, fueled by recently-passed U.S. tax bill [nL1N1OK19H] [nL4N1OL4PK] [nL4N1OF49J]

** OIH momentum improving; weekly MACD rising, approaching zero-line. Chart: http://reut.rs/2Bi8xWq

** Weekly close above descending 40-WMA (now $25.56) would be first since early Apr

** In that event, OIH can look to challenge resistance line from summer 2014 (now ~$27.25), with potential then for a breakout next year toward $31.00 area

** Thus, despite its poor 2017 return, OIH could be one to watch into 2018 [nL1N1O00R0]

** Breaking Oct low ($22.99), however, can signal bear trend resuming [nL1N1OI0OA] [nL1N1O71S6]

** Top OIH holdings by pct weight end-Nov include: Schlumberger , Halliburton and Helmerich and Payne

UPDATE 1-Iraq oil ministry starts taking over Majnoon oilfield operations - 路透新闻

{{20171221T100550.324+0000}}UPDATE 1-Iraq oil ministry starts taking over Majnoon oilfield operationsBAGHDAD, Dec 21 (Reuters)

(Adds quote, details, background)

By Ahmed Rasheed

BAGHDAD, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Iraq's oil ministry said on Thursday it had started to take over operations of Majnoon oilfield from Royal Dutch Shell and planned to lift output in future.

The ministry said it had formed a management team to handle production after Shell exits the field by the end of June.

"The priority of the new management team is to cut the cost of producing a barrel (of crude) from Majnoon by 30 percent," Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said in a statement.

Iraq plans to increase output from Majnoon to 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the "coming years", the ministry said, without giving a precise timeline.

Production is now about 235,000 bpd, oil officials say.

A letter signed by the minister, dated Aug. 23 and seen by Reuters, gave approval for the Anglo-Dutch firm to quit Majnoon, a major oilfield near Basra which started production in 2014. [nL5N1LT67P]

Shell said it would focus its efforts on developing and expanding Basra Gas Company in Iraq after handing over operations of Majnoon to the Iraqi government.

Basra Gas Company is a joint venture between Shell, South Gas Company and Mitsubishi and the Petrochemical Project NEBRAS.

Chevron , Total and PetroChina <601857.SS> may form a consortium to develop Iraq's Majnoon oilfield, the minister said in Vienna in November. [nL8N1O03DO]

By Chen Aizhu

BEIJING, Dec 18 (Reuters) - PetroChina's <0857.HK> oil and gas trading arm aims to buy petrol stations and fuel storage facilities, setting up business in West Africa, Brazil and Pakistan in a major global expansion aimed at taking on international rivals, according to three senior oil industry executives briefed on the plans.

The ambitious drive at one of the world's top oil merchants is taking shape eight months after Tian Jinghui, a vice president at PetroChina, took over the reins at Chinaoil, PetroChina's trading vehicle. Tian is a veteran of fuel marketing at PetroChina, a listed unit of state giant CNPC and Asia's largest oil and gas producer. [nL3N1HR3PC]

Tian's plan would mark a step on from the legacy of former chairwoman Wang Lihua - 'Madame Wang' to staff and peers - who led a previous round of expansion characterised by asset-heavy investments that included nearly $4 billion worth of stakes in four refineries stretching from Scotland to Japan.

"The pace of execution is accelerating after Tian took over and the strategy fits his expertise," said one Beijing-based executive with direct knowledge of the matter. He and two other executives briefed on the plans declined to be named because they were not authorised to speak to the press.

The new investments are expected to start as soon as next year, and mimic the moves the world's top oil merchants Vitol and Trafigura have made recently - spending billions to buy up thousands of petrol stations in Pakistan, Turkey and Africa. [nL5N1GN28P]

They said the aim is to have a foothold in emerging markets and grow market share locally, with fuel supplies from refineries PetroChina operates globally as well as barrels exported from China where demand is slowing in a moderating economy. They didn't disclose how much PetroChina might invest in the new drive.

The expansion also aimed at tapping the transportation fuel market in those regions, where demand is growing faster than the global average, the executives said. In West Africa, it has its sights on Nigeria and Angola, they said.

"Supplies to these markets have over the past been done through random tenders or ad-hoc business trips, that do not guarantee the company winning the deals," said the executive.

A spokesman for PetroChina didn't respond to requests for comment.

ENGLISH CLASSES

With the sharp drop in global oil prices, major integrated oil companies have been shedding assets, including marginally profitable retail outlets, to cut costs.

Chevron is in the process of selling its refinery in Cape Town and more than 1,000 petrol stations in South Africa and Botswana, in a deal that has attracted China's Sinopec and commodities and miner Glencore competing for the assets. [nL8N1MH20U]

Young staff from PetroChina's massive domestic marketing team were sent on a three-month English course earlier this year as candidates for potential new overseas postings, said two of the three people with knowledge of the plans.

These will be new additions to the 300-strong trading and marketing team PetroChina now has mainly in global trading hubs Singapore, London and Houston, they said.

Chinaoil currently procures and trades nearly 7 million barrels of oil a day (bpd), including 4.8 million bpd of crude oil and 2.2 million bpd of oil products. That exceeds Vitol's 6 million bpd as Chinaoil markets global production from PetroChina.

"Tian wants to apply his domestic marketing expertise globally...to upgrade PetroChina's global fuel marketing from being just a wholesaler sitting at trading hubs to a retailer in consuming regions," said one of the senior industry executives.

Buying storage tanks or petrol stations will be less costly than investing in refineries, but will still be a challenge for a team with mostly domestic experience.

"It will be hugely challenging for the new people Tian sends in these new posts, to be familiar with local legal framework and learn to handle public relations," said a third senior source.

Activist investor files Chevron proxy resolution on Myanmar rights concerns - 路透新闻

{{20171218T231258.866+0000}}Activist investor files Chevron proxy resolution on Myanmar rights concernsHOUSTON, Dec 18 (Reuters)

By Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, Dec 18 (Reuters) - An activist investor in Chevron Corp said on Monday it filed a shareholder resolution that would require the oil producer to report on the feasibility of ending operations in Myanmar, where a crackdown on minority Rohingya Muslims has been decried by the United States as "ethnic cleansing."

The resolution, filed last week by Islamic finance firm Azzad Asset Management, pushes Chevron's board of directors to consider how it could avoid risks "posed by doing business with governments complicit in genocide or crimes against humanity."

Azzad filed a similar resolution at the last Chevron shareholder meeting, garnering support from 6 percent of votes cast.

More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to southern Bangladesh since the end of August following a campaign by Myanmar security forces in response to attacks by militants in Rakhine State. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and United Nations officials have decried the crackdown as a form of genocide. [nL8N1O528F]

Myanmar denies committing atrocities against the Rohingya.

Chevron, the second-largest U.S.-based oil producer, does business in Myanmar through a subsidiary, Unocal Myanmar Offshore Co Ltd. It has projects that include a minority interest in natural gas production and a pipeline, according to the company's website.

In a statement to Reuters on Monday, Chevron spokeswoman Melissa Ritchie said the company "values the ongoing dialogue with the stockholders on this critical issue of violence in Rakhine State, Myanmar.

"We will continue to work with other U.S. companies and the government to promote the value of U.S. investment in Myanmar and the need to foster a business environment that respects human rights."

Chevron has the option of accepting the proposal or asking the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to allow it to block it. If Chevron moves to block, Azzad would have the chance to appeal to the SEC. Chevron's annual meeting is slated for next spring.

The filing comes as two Reuters journalists were arrested by Myanmar officials last week. Government officials accuse the pair of violating the country's colonial-era Officials Secrets Act. The arrests have been criticized by several governments as well as journalists' and human rights groups. [nL4N1OI3G6]

Chevron declined to directly comment on the arrests.

* 300,000 bbl Cold Lake crude to arrive in 2nd half of Feb

* GS Caltex trying out heavy crude from Canada -source

(Adds comment, shipment details)

By Jane Chung and Florence Tan

SEOUL/SINGAPORE, Dec 18 (Reuters) - South Korean refiner GS Caltex Corp has bought a rare cargo of Cold Lake crude, the company's first purchase in more than two decades of this Canadian oil grade, a company spokesman said on Monday.

The second-largest refiner in South Korea bought 300,000 barrels of the heavy sour crude for delivery in the second half of February, he said.

The refiner is trying out a small volume of the oil, which has a quality similar to that of Iraq's Basra Heavy crude, a person familiar with the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorised speak to media.

About 300,000 barrels of Cold Lake were loaded onto Panamax Selecao on Dec. 13 at Vancouver for delivery to an unspecified destination, trade flows data on Thomson Reuters Eikon showed.

One trading source said the arbitrage window might have briefly opened when the discount between U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude and Brent futures stretched as wide as $7 a barrel last week on a disruption in Forties crude supply. [nL3N1OB15B]

Heavy crude produced in Canada is trading close to its deepest discount in four years as pipeline constraints pushed western Canadian crude inventories to record highs. [nL1N1OF019]

GS Caltex operates a 790,000 barrels per day refinery in Yeosu. The refiner is equally owned by GS Energy Corp, a unit of GS Holdings <078930.KS>, and U.S. oil major Chevron Corp .

Another South Korean refiner Hyundai Oilbank Corp has also expressed interest in purchasing Canadian crude. [nL4N1M82EW]

RPT-INSIGHT-Paralysis at PDVSA: Venezuela's oil purge cripples company - 路透新闻

{{20171215T120000.000+0000}}RPT-INSIGHT-Paralysis at PDVSA: Venezuela's oil purge cripples companyCARACAS/HOUSTON, Dec 15 (Reuters)

(Repeats with no changes to text)

By Alexandra Ulmer and Marianna Parraga

CARACAS/HOUSTON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Decisions at some joint ventures with foreign firms are delayed. A growing number of oil tankers sit idle because no one authorizes payments. Employees struggle to get approval for routine expenses, from taxis to training.

An alleged crackdown on graft in Venezuela, seen by critics as an effort by President Nicolas Maduro to consolidate power, has sown panic across the country's energy industry and all but paralyzed state-run Petroleos de Venezuela SA, or PDVSA, according to people at the company and across the sector.

The ongoing purge, in which prosecutors have arrested at least 67 executives including two recently ousted oil ministers, now threatens to further harm operations for the OPEC country, which is already producing at near 30-year-lows and struggling to run PDVSA units including Citgo Petroleum, its U.S. refiner.

Further trouble for the all-important industry could cause yet more economic chaos in the once-prosperous Andean country, which is currently grappling with a profound recession, soaring crime and violence, crippled public services and the world's steepest inflation rate.

Many of those detained have not yet been replaced, as the once world-leading company, already struggling with a brain drain, wants for qualified personnel. Executives that remain, meanwhile, are so rattled by the arrests that they are loathe to act, scared they will later be accused of wrongdoing.

"In PDVSA, nobody dares sign anything now, not even a Christmas card," said one executive at a joint venture between PDVSA and a foreign firm in the Orinoco oil belt, asking to remain anonymous.

Interviews with around 20 current and former PDVSA employees, executives at foreign firms, traders and PDVSA clients say fear is compounding problems including the loss of talent, mounting debts, equipment shortages, rampant theft and chronic underinvestment.

Venezuela's Oil Ministry and PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] did not respond to a request for comment.

"WITCH HUNT"

Oil accounts for over 90 percent of Venezuela's export revenue and provides the hard currency for Maduro's socialist government. Yet the country, which sits on the world's largest crude reserves, is now producing under 2 million barrels per day (bpd). [nL1N1NJ0OV]

A political tool even before Maduro mentor Hugo Chavez became president in 1999, PDVSA has increasingly become an extension of Venezuela's beleaguered government, critics say, with lackeys and soldiers now filling posts, including the top job, that once required industry expertise.

In what some executives call a "witch hunt," some mid-level managers are now using the purge as an excuse to fire anti-government employees or even disliked colleagues. [nL1N1KT1ER]

"You say anything against anyone right now, and they believe you," said one PDVSA employee, calling from a relative's phone to avoid potential eavesdropping.

The purge comes years after industry analysts and opposition politicians began criticizing PDVSA management for widespread graft. A report by the opposition-led Congress last year said at least $11 billion went "missing" at PDVSA between 2004 and 2014.

For years, the government decried such accusations as "smear campaigns" against socialism and in favor of a U.S.-backed coup.

But Maduro, expected to run for reelection next year, recently changed tone. He now blames "thieves" and "traitors" for an economic crisis so severe that disease and malnutrition are spreading unchecked by a broken public health system.

Arrests, including that of former oil ministers and PDVSA bosses Eulogio Del Pino and Nelson Martinez last month, have targeted officials once thought untouchable. Attorneys and opposition figures criticize prosecutors for providing little evidence of crimes.

Maduro last month appointed a general to take the reins of PDVSA and the oil ministry. [nL1N1NX01M] The new oil czar, former housing minister Major General Manuel Quevedo, has no experience in the energy sector.

Quevedo has yet to produce a detailed business plan, but has vowed to boost production by 1 million bpd - roughly the volume lost in the last four years.

"If we can build almost 2 million homes, we can recover production!" he said in a recent speech to employees, urging them to name and shame "squalid" pro-opposition colleagues.

Critics within the sector say Quevedo's words betray ignorance of what it would take to revive the foundering industry. They say there is no proof that the general even oversaw construction of that many houses.

Already, Quevedo decreed that all contracts with PDVSA be reviewed in a "clean up." While it is unclear what the review will entail, it has already spooked clients and partners who fear for the integrity of existing contracts. [nL1N1O30LE]

DELAYS AND CONFUSION

There is also growing concern about PDVSA's dwindling ability to finance payments and operations, especially with inexperienced executives now at the helm.

Some PDVSA employees say boat shortages are so acute in western Lake Maracaibo that workers often cannot get to platforms. Late payments have led tanker operators to halt around 18 vessels needed to carry oil and refined products, two sources said.

PDVSA's crown jewel, Texas-based Citgo, has not been spared.

Most of its board was arrested in Caracas last month, and Asdrubal Chavez, a cousin of the late president, was appointed to replace his jailed predecessor. So far, Chavez is managing Citgo from Caracas, two sources said, causing delays and confusion.

Citgo did not respond to a request for comment.

Even much of the day-to-day office work at PDVSA has ground to a halt. One PDVSA worker said simple expenses like taxis are now off the table.

"They've suspended training courses," said another employee.

Combined, the woes are prompting analysts to question just how low Venezuela's oil production will fall.

The International Energy Agency predicts output will fall at least 500,000 bpd to 1.5 million bpd in 2018. Analysis firm Medley Global Advisors forecasts a decline of as much as 550,000 bpd, citing risks including "PDVSA's militarization and purge of what remains of its technical capacity."

A steep drop would heighten chances that cash-strapped Venezuela defaults on some $60 billion in foreign debt. Maduro's government has sought to restructure the debt, but has continued to make payments, albeit with delays.

Even if production rebounded, PDVSA does not stand to reap a windfall. A growing portion of exports are being used to repay loans from allies, like China and Russia, who have thrown vital lifelines to Maduro's government. [nL1N1KW27W]

Meanwhile, foreign companies in Venezuela, including U.S. oil major Chevron Corp. and Russian energy giant Rosneft , are frustrated. They see little progress on longstanding demands, from more operational control at joint ventures with PDVSA to better security at isolated oil fields, according to people close to the firms.

"We've lost hope of resolving our problems," said one executive. "We're on hold."

INSIGHT-Paralysis at PDVSA: Venezuela's oil purge cripples company - 路透新闻

{{20171215T060001.000+0000}}INSIGHT-Paralysis at PDVSA: Venezuela's oil purge cripples companyCARACAS/HOUSTON, Dec 15 (Reuters)

By Alexandra Ulmer and Marianna Parraga

CARACAS/HOUSTON, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Decisions at some joint ventures with foreign firms are delayed. A growing number of oil tankers sit idle because no one authorizes payments. Employees struggle to get approval for routine expenses, from taxis to training.

An alleged crackdown on graft in Venezuela, seen by critics as an effort by President Nicolas Maduro to consolidate power, has sown panic across the country's energy industry and all but paralyzed state-run Petroleos de Venezuela SA, or PDVSA, according to people at the company and across the sector.

The ongoing purge, in which prosecutors have arrested at least 67 executives including two recently ousted oil ministers, now threatens to further harm operations for the OPEC country, which is already producing at near 30-year-lows and struggling to run PDVSA units including Citgo Petroleum, its U.S. refiner.

Further trouble for the all-important industry could cause yet more economic chaos in the once-prosperous Andean country, which is currently grappling with a profound recession, soaring crime and violence, crippled public services and the world's steepest inflation rate.

Many of those detained have not yet been replaced, as the once world-leading company, already struggling with a brain drain, wants for qualified personnel. Executives that remain, meanwhile, are so rattled by the arrests that they are loathe to act, scared they will later be accused of wrongdoing.

"In PDVSA, nobody dares sign anything now, not even a Christmas card," said one executive at a joint venture between PDVSA and a foreign firm in the Orinoco oil belt, asking to remain anonymous.

Interviews with around 20 current and former PDVSA employees, executives at foreign firms, traders and PDVSA clients say fear is compounding problems including the loss of talent, mounting debts, equipment shortages, rampant theft and chronic underinvestment.

Venezuela's Oil Ministry and PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] did not respond to a request for comment.

"WITCH HUNT"

Oil accounts for over 90 percent of Venezuela's export revenue and provides the hard currency for Maduro's socialist government. Yet the country, which sits on the world's largest crude reserves, is now producing under 2 million barrels per day (bpd). [nL1N1NJ0OV]

A political tool even before Maduro mentor Hugo Chavez became president in 1999, PDVSA has increasingly become an extension of Venezuela's beleaguered government, critics say, with lackeys and soldiers now filling posts, including the top job, that once required industry expertise.

In what some executives call a "witch hunt," some mid-level managers are now using the purge as an excuse to fire anti-government employees or even disliked colleagues. [nL1N1KT1ER]

"You say anything against anyone right now, and they believe you," said one PDVSA employee, calling from a relative's phone to avoid potential eavesdropping.

The purge comes years after industry analysts and opposition politicians began criticizing PDVSA management for widespread graft. A report by the opposition-led Congress last year said at least $11 billion went "missing" at PDVSA between 2004 and 2014.

For years, the government decried such accusations as "smear campaigns" against socialism and in favor of a U.S.-backed coup.

But Maduro, expected to run for reelection next year, recently changed tone. He now blames "thieves" and "traitors" for an economic crisis so severe that disease and malnutrition are spreading unchecked by a broken public health system.

EXCLUSIVE-Chevron nears Schlumberger deal to drill wells in Brazil -sources - 路透新闻

{{20171214T205728.000+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Chevron nears Schlumberger deal to drill wells in Brazil -sourcesRIO DE JANEIRO, Dec 14 (Reuters)

By Alexandra Alper

RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec 14 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp has reached preliminary agreement with oil services firm Schlumberger NV to drill six wells in a Brazilian offshore field, two sources said this week, in a bid to lift its output in the South American country after a 2011 oil spill there cut production.

Six wells would be drilled in the Frade field in Brazil's offshore Campos basin, and work should begin in early 2019, the sources said. Drilling for the contract, worth about $20 million would be spread over 18 to 24 months, one of the people familiar with the matter said.

One of the sources spoke on Thursday and the other on Wednesday. Both declined to be named since the agreement was not public or final.

The proposed price tag does not include well completion or drilling fluids needed for the project, the sources said. The agreement, which awaits approval by Chevron's board, covers drilling, drill bits, cementing and well data collection, they said.

Chevron spokeswoman Isabel Ordonez declined to comment. Schlumberger spokesman Joao Felix also declined to comment.

If approved, the project would mark a much-anticipated expansion of exploration for Chevron in Latin America's top oil producing nation, where its output has slumped to 12,500 barrels per day (bpd) from 36,400 bpd before the 2011 accident.

The spill, which released 2,400 barrels into the ocean some 107 kilometers (73 miles) off the coast of Rio de Janeiro state, did not reach the shore and was smaller than several previous spills in Brazil by state-controlled oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA .

But coming on the heels of BP Plc's 4.9 million-barrel U.S. Gulf of Mexico spill, the accident drew widespread attention and led prosecutors to bring criminal charges against the company and 11 employees, as well as to seek $10.7 billion in damages through a civil lawsuit.

According to a 2013 filing, Chevron settled the civil charges by promising to spend $43 million on social and environmental programs. The criminal charges were dismissed in 2015, but prosecutors have sought to reinstate the case by appealing the decision, Chevron has said.

Chevron did not take part in October auctions of blocks in Brazil's choice offshore pre-salt layer, even as rivals Royal Dutch Shell , BP and Exxon Mobil Corp bet big.

Petrobras owns 30 percent of Frade. Chevron owns 52 percent and is responsible for field management. The rest is owned by Frade Japao, a unit of Japan's Inpex.

UPDATE 4-Broken pipeline cuts British supply during peak energy demand - 路透新闻

{{20171212T202402.949+0000}}UPDATE 4-Broken pipeline cuts British supply during peak energy demand* Oil and gas supplies disrupted during UK cold snap

* Forties is key oil flow for benchmark Brent prices

* Brent jumps above $65 for first time since mid-2015

(Updates with INEOS saying outage could last up to 4 weeks)

By Ron Bousso, Amanda Cooper and Alex Lawler

LONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Britain's biggest pipeline from its North Sea oil and gas fields is likely to be shut for several weeks for repairs, its operator said on Tuesday, disrupting gas flows and sending international crude prices to their highest since mid-2015.

The closure has struck during a winter freeze in Britain, where snow and ice have driven up demand for heating fuel just as gas flows through the network, which carries a third of Britain's gas produced offshore, were disrupted.

"We are working to get the pipeline restored to full operation as quickly as we can safely do so... We have previously indicated a time frame of three to four weeks and we believe it is no less than two," operator INEOS said in a email to customers seen by Reuters.

The pipeline, which carries about 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Forties crude, was shut after cracks were found.

It has particular significance to global markets because Forties is the largest out of the five crude oil streams that underpin the dated Brent benchmark, against which other crude prices are broadly based. Benchmark Brent crude prices rose above $65 per barrel for the first time since the middle of 2015 following the closure on Monday. [O/R]

INEOS only completed the purchase of the Forties pipeline system from oil major BP in October. A minor leak had caused a partial shutdown on Dec. 7 and a full shutdown on Monday. INEOS said the small crack has not increased over the past 24 hours.

Paul Wheelhouse, the Scottish energy minister, said there were no plans to shut the 200,000 bpd Grangemouth refinery, which uses Forties crude. [nL9N1NR00L]

"If it's a lengthy outage, then a recovery period for the fields will be long as well," the trading source said.

FIELDS CLOSING

A number of producers including BP , Shell and Chrysaor, said they had closed down oil fields in response.

The largest contributor to the Forties stream, the 180,000-bpd Buzzard oil field run by Nexen Petroleum UK Ltd, a subsidiary of China's CNOOC <0883.HK>, had also closed, two trading sources said. [CRU/OUT]

Monthly loading programmes show the supply of Forties is expected to reach 21 cargoes of 600,000 barrels each this month, equal to a daily supply rate of 406,000 bpd. [nL9N1AF03S]

The closure has created havoc with loading schedules in the North Sea, with one trading source saying cargo owners had been offered options to drop cargoes from the loading programme.

"At this point we would expect a large deferral list for the Forties loading programme to spill over into January," analysts from JBC Energy said in a note.

"The timing of the outage could not be much worse as winter weather is just materialising," Jefferies bank analysts wrote.

Jefferies estimated the closure resulted in production loss for BP of 105,000 bpd, for Total of 55,000 bpd, for Chevron of 45,000 bpd, for Exxon Mobil of 40,000, for Eni of 25,000 bpd, for Shell of 25,000 bpd, for ConocoPhillips of 15,000 bpd.

The Paris-based International Energy Agency, which advises Western governments and coordinates the release of oil from strategic stocks in the case of supply disruptions, said it stood ready to take action but it did not believe this was necessary for the time being.

"The market is amply supplied from other sources and stocks are well above the five-year average," the IEA said. [nL8N1OC4HN]

Dec 12 (Reuters) - The Dow Jones Industrial Average was set to open higher on Tuesday on gains from oil-related stocks and Boeing, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq futures pointed to a flat opening ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy meeting.

The benchmark Brent crude , gained more than 1.65 percent to rise above $65 a barrel for the first time since mid-2015 after an unplanned shutdown of the UK's biggest North Sea oil pipeline.[O/R]

Shares of oil majors Exxon , Chevron and Schlumberger rose by between 0.14 percent and 0.68 percent in premarket trading.

Boeing shares were set to open at a record high after the company said it would raise its quarterly dividend by 20 percent and replace its existing share buyback program with a new $18 billion authorization. [nL3N1OB531]

At 8:31 a.m. ET (1331 GMT), Dow e-minis <1YMc1> were up 52 points, or 0.21 percent, with 11,295 contracts changing hands.

S&P 500 e-minis were up 1.75 points, or 0.07 percent, with 194,263 contracts traded.

Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 2.5 points, or 0.04 percent, on volume of 16,031 contracts.

The Fed is widely expected to raise its benchmark interest rate for third time this year at the end of the meeting on Wednesday. Traders see an 87.6 percent chance of a 25 basis point rate hike, according to CME Group's Fedwatch tool.

Investors will watch for the central bank's forecast on future rate hikes and the view on the health of the economy.

In Sept, the central bank forecast three rate hikes in 2018, but a sluggish wage growth and inflation that has run below the its forecast has raised doubts about the pace of future rate hikes.

A fairly upbeat November U.S. payrolls report showed strength in job growth, but average hourly earnings rose less-than-expected. [nLNS8NED2N]

"Investors are presented with an interesting economic outlook. They are looking at a positive set of economic data in an improving economy, with some hesitation with regards to Federal Reserve, given the change in leadership," said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey. Though the current Fed Chair, Janet Yellen, will continue until February, her final press conference on Wednesday afternoon will set the policy backdrop incoming Chair, Jerome Powell, inherits.

A Labor Department report showed U.S. producer prices rose in November as gasoline prices surged and the cost of other goods increased.

Producer price index for final demand increased 0.4 percent last month, while economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index rising 0.3 percent. [nLNSCNED2U]

Comcast shares rose about 1.74 percent after the company abandoned its bid for most of the assets of Twenty-First Century Fox , leaving Walt Disney as the sole suitor of the $40 billion-plus deal. [nL1N1OB1XQ]

Disney shares rose 0.47 percent.

* BHP hires Barclays, Citi, BAML and GS

By Clara Denina and David French

LONDON/NEW YORK, Dec 12 (Reuters) - BHP , the world's largest miner, has asked four investment banks to help it prepare for either a sale or spin-off of its underperforming U.S. shale oil and gas unit, with a view to taking a decision in early 2018, sources said.

BHP said in August it aimed to sell its unconventional onshore shale assets in the Eagle Ford, Permian, Haynesville and Fayetteville basins, which it acquired at the height of the oil boom and could be valued at more than $10 billion.

It has hired Barclays and Bank of America-Merrill Lynch to assess options for the sale of assets, including whether they would be sold together or separately, as they may appeal to different potential buyers, the sources said.

It has also asked Citi and Goldman Sachs to research the potential spin-off of the unit into a new company, the sources added.

BHP, Citi, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch declined to comment. Barclays and Goldman Sachs did not reply to a request for comment.

Although global oil prices have steadied after sinking to multi-year lows of $27 a barrel in 2016, they remain some 40 percent lower than the $112 highs hit in 2014.

The company is now pursuing two potential exits: a sale of the assets or separation into a standalone company, which is usually a tax-free solution for the parent company.

BHP will keep its conventional assets in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, Australia and Trinidad and Tobago. [nL4N1L75D4]

BAD BETS

The miner's entire petroleum division, valued at more than $20 billion, was its second-biggest earner behind iron ore until 2014.[nL4N1II022]

But bad bets on U.S. shale and collapsing oil and gas prices turned it into a big drag from 2015. As a result, U.S. activist investor Elliott Advisors, which has built up a 5 percent stake in BHP's London-listed arm, urged the sale of the whole U.S. petroleum business to help boost shareholder value. [nL4N1L75D4]

Hurt by the oil pain plus the woes from a dam disaster in Brazil in late 2015 at a mine it half owns, the miner's share performance this year so far was the weakest compared to major peers Rio Tinto , Glencore and Anglo American . BHP is the biggest by market capitalization of them all.

"Splitting the business into a standalone company would give shares back to shareholders," one of the sources said.

However, they all pointed out that this could be a problem because BHP's shareholders are mostly mining investors who wouldn't want to be holding oil shares.

The company could consider selling some or all of the shares of the newly formed company to the market via a public listing, with the proceeds of such an offering going to BHP shareholders.

This would be the second demerger in three years for the company, which spun off its aluminum, manganese, nickel, silver and coal assets into South32 in 2015.

The mining company will run the sale of its gas-rich Fayetteville field in Arkansas, for which it hired Barclays back in May, separately, one of the sources said.[nL4N1HY1CF][nL8N1IO305]

Bankers expect companies like Chevron , Occidental Petroleum , Statoil and Exxon Mobil to be interested in the Permian assets, viewed as the highest quality, while Eagle Ford may be less attractive as a single asset and may need to be sold in parts.

Its Hayensville assets will likely attract interest from private equity buyers, sources added.

Norway parties inclined to back fund's plan to slash oil exposure -report - 路透新闻

{{20171212T084218.566+0000}}Norway parties inclined to back fund's plan to slash oil exposure -reportOSLO, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, will probably win backing from parliament for its proposal to cut most oil and gas stocks from its portfolio, business daily Dagens Naeringsliv reported on Tuesday.

If adopted by parliament, the fund would over time divest billions of dollars from oil and gas stocks, which now represent 6 percent - or around $37 billion - of its benchmark equity index.

The fund last month suggested it should cut oil and gas companies from its benchmark index to make the Norwegian government's wealth less vulnerable to low crude prices. [nL8N1NM4UW]

A majority of parties in Norway's parliament, including the top opposition Labour Party and the smaller Centre Party, the Socialist Left and the Christian Democrats, told Dagens Naeringsliv they were inclined to back the proposal.

The Conservative-led minority government has said it will study the suggestion and give its opinion in the autumn of 2018, ahead of a potential decision by parliament in 2019.

While most of the opposition parties said they will take the government's view into account before making a final decision, they have the power to decide the outcome among themselves.

The fund is among the top investors in a wide range of oil companies. At the end of 2016 it held 2.3 percent of Royal Dutch Shell , 1.7 percent of BP , 0.9 percent of Chevron and 0.8 percent of Exxon Mobil .

It also held 1.7 percent of Italy's Eni , 1.6 percent of France's Total and 0.9 percent of Sweden's Lundin Petroleum , among others.

UPDATE 4-Broken pipeline cuts British supply during peak energy demand - 路透新闻

{{20171212T001401.000+0000}}UPDATE 4-Broken pipeline cuts British supply during peak energy demandLONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters)

* Oil and gas supplies disrupted during UK cold snap

* Forties is key oil flow for benchmark Brent prices

* Brent jumps above $65 for first time since mid-2015

(Updates with INEOS saying outage could last up to 4 weeks)

By Ron Bousso, Amanda Cooper and Alex Lawler

LONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Britain's biggest pipeline from its North Sea oil and gas fields is likely to be shut for several weeks for repairs, its operator said on Tuesday, disrupting gas flows and sending international crude prices to their highest since mid-2015.

The closure has struck during a winter freeze in Britain, where snow and ice have driven up demand for heating fuel just as gas flows through the network, which carries a third of Britain's gas produced offshore, were disrupted.

"We are working to get the pipeline restored to full operation as quickly as we can safely do so... We have previously indicated a time frame of three to four weeks and we believe it is no less than two," operator INEOS said in a email to customers seen by Reuters.

The pipeline, which carries about 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Forties crude, was shut after cracks were found.

It has particular significance to global markets because Forties is the largest out of the five crude oil streams that underpin the dated Brent benchmark, against which other crude prices are broadly based. Benchmark Brent crude prices rose above $65 per barrel for the first time since the middle of 2015 following the closure on Monday. [O/R]

INEOS only completed the purchase of the Forties pipeline system from oil major BP in October. A minor leak had caused a partial shutdown on Dec. 7 and a full shutdown on Monday. INEOS said the small crack has not increased over the past 24 hours.

Paul Wheelhouse, the Scottish energy minister, said there were no plans to shut the 200,000 bpd Grangemouth refinery, which uses Forties crude. [nL9N1NR00L]

"If it's a lengthy outage, then a recovery period for the fields will be long as well," the trading source said.

FIELDS CLOSING

A number of producers including BP , Shell and Chrysaor, said they had closed down oil fields in response.

The largest contributor to the Forties stream, the 180,000-bpd Buzzard oil field run by Nexen Petroleum UK Ltd, a subsidiary of China's CNOOC <0883.HK>, had also closed, two trading sources said. [CRU/OUT]

Monthly loading programmes show the supply of Forties is expected to reach 21 cargoes of 600,000 barrels each this month, equal to a daily supply rate of 406,000 bpd. [nL9N1AF03S]

The closure has created havoc with loading schedules in the North Sea, with one trading source saying cargo owners had been offered options to drop cargoes from the loading programme.

"At this point we would expect a large deferral list for the Forties loading programme to spill over into January," analysts from JBC Energy said in a note.

"The timing of the outage could not be much worse as winter weather is just materialising," Jefferies bank analysts wrote.

Jefferies estimated the closure resulted in production loss for BP of 105,000 bpd, for Total of 55,000 bpd, for Chevron of 45,000 bpd, for Exxon Mobil of 40,000, for Eni of 25,000 bpd, for Shell of 25,000 bpd, for ConocoPhillips of 15,000 bpd.

The Paris-based International Energy Agency, which advises Western governments and coordinates the release of oil from strategic stocks in the case of supply disruptions, said it stood ready to take action but it did not believe this was necessary for the time being.

"The market is amply supplied from other sources and stocks are well above the five-year average," the IEA said. [nL8N1OC4HN]

RPT-Fuel shippers seek U.S. review of 'excessive' Colonial Pipeline rates - 路透新闻

{{20171208T192018.409+0000}}RPT-Fuel shippers seek U.S. review of 'excessive' Colonial Pipeline rates(Repeats to put pictures in media slug line, no change to text)

By Devika Krishna Kumar and Jarrett Renshaw

NEW YORK, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Oil major Chevron, leading refiner Valero and Delta Air Lines have complained to the U.S. energy watchdog about fees Colonial Pipeline charges to ship gasoline, diesel and jet fuel over its fuel network, the country's largest.

The 917-page complaint, filed last month with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), says Colonial's fees "greatly exceed just and reasonable levels". It alleges Colonial overcharged the companies by more than $60 million combined, and is potentially monopolizing fuel delivery into the New York region.

The complaint could lead to the first regulatory reexamination of Colonial Pipeline's rates in nearly 20 years, at a time when the line's importance for delivering refined products to the Northeast and Southeast United States has come into sharp focus. Colonial says the complaint has no merit, and a legal expert said it may be hard for the shippers to prove their case.

Even with the current fees, the 3 million-barrel-per-day Colonial system is the cheapest and most efficient way to move barrels from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast. Over the past two years, a series of outages, including shutdown of parts of the line in wake of Hurricane Harvey, drove up pump prices and created fears of gasoline shortages across numerous states.

Spokeswoman Malesia Dunn said Colonial Pipeline believes the shippers manipulated data "and made improper and highly unrealistic assumptions in an effort to strengthen their arguments."

The complaint was filed on Nov. 22 by Chevron Products Co, Valero Marketing & Supply Co and Epsilon Trading LLC, the trading arm of Delta. The companies did not elaborate on the dispute to Reuters.

Colonial shippers have often complained that the company has tried to squeeze access and limit competition for space on its congested line. One shipper sued Colonial this year in federal court in New Jersey, alleging it is blending gasoline from its customers without authorization, and profiting from that. The company has answered the complaint, denying the charges.

"We have a diverse shipper base, with nearly 300 shippers," said Dunn. "We aim to provide value and the best offerings for a majority of shippers. We can't customize for every shipper."

Other companies, such as Murphy Oil, Vitol and Flint Resources LP have lodged complaints with FERC against Colonial in the past two years, but the latest action represents the largest threat to the operator's current rate structure.

"I expect given the importance of the line, the resources of the parties bringing the complaint and the number of shippers that use the line, this case will be heavily litigated and is very serious," said Tony Clark, a senior advisor at Wilkinson, Barker Knauer LLP and a FERC Commissioner from 2012 until 2016.

NEW YORK MONOPOLY

The companies say in the complaint that they were collectively overcharged by about $64.1 million between Oct. 1, 2015 and Sept. 30, 2017. They say Colonial's exorbitant and opaque fee structure pushed its 2016 interstate revenue to exceed its costs by $339.3 million, earning it about a 29 percent realized return on equity.

The companies said they used adjustments that accounted for, among other things, the cost of two pipeline outages in 2016 to arrive at that figure.

"The Commission has previously held that an apparent over-recovery of this magnitude...is more than sufficient to warrant setting for hearing a complaint against the pipeline rates," the complaint says.

Interstate pipelines are allowed to recover operating costs by charging shippers to use the line, but are prohibited from "over-recovery."

The U.S. Congress set Colonial's rates in 1990s-era legislation. In 2001, FERC allowed Colonial to charge market-based rates from the Gulf Coast to the Philadelphia and New York areas, on the understanding that Colonial lacked monopoly power over those markets. For other delivery points, such as Alabama and Georgia, Colonial rates are not market-based.

Colonial's market power raises serious concerns over whether its rates remain "just and reasonable," the complaint says. It says the market-based rate structure has not undergone scrutiny for years, while economic conditions have changed enough to warrant a review.

It may be hard for shippers to convince FERC that market-based rates are excessive, said FERC litigation partner Joseph Fagan, at Day Pitney LLP.

"Simply saying that they are charging rates that are very high and therefore they must have market power, that doesn't get you there ... Frustration does not a valid complaint make," he said.

Fuel shippers seek U.S. review of 'excessive' Colonial Pipeline rates - 路透新闻

{{20171208T184727.788+0000}}Fuel shippers seek U.S. review of 'excessive' Colonial Pipeline ratesBy Devika Krishna Kumar and Jarrett Renshaw

NEW YORK, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Oil major Chevron, leading refiner Valero and Delta Air Lines have complained to the U.S. energy watchdog about fees Colonial Pipeline charges to ship gasoline, diesel and jet fuel over its fuel network, the country's largest.

The 917-page complaint, filed last month with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), says Colonial's fees "greatly exceed just and reasonable levels". It alleges Colonial overcharged the companies by more than $60 million combined, and is potentially monopolizing fuel delivery into the New York region.

The complaint could lead to the first regulatory reexamination of Colonial Pipeline's rates in nearly 20 years, at a time when the line's importance for delivering refined products to the Northeast and Southeast United States has come into sharp focus. Colonial says the complaint has no merit, and a legal expert said it may be hard for the shippers to prove their case.

Even with the current fees, the 3 million-barrel-per-day Colonial system is the cheapest and most efficient way to move barrels from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast. Over the past two years, a series of outages, including shutdown of parts of the line in wake of Hurricane Harvey, drove up pump prices and created fears of gasoline shortages across numerous states.

Spokeswoman Malesia Dunn said Colonial Pipeline believes the shippers manipulated data "and made improper and highly unrealistic assumptions in an effort to strengthen their arguments."

The complaint was filed on Nov. 22 by Chevron Products Co, Valero Marketing & Supply Co and Epsilon Trading LLC, the trading arm of Delta. The companies did not elaborate on the dispute to Reuters.

Colonial shippers have often complained that the company has tried to squeeze access and limit competition for space on its congested line. One shipper sued Colonial this year in federal court in New Jersey, alleging it is blending gasoline from its customers without authorization, and profiting from that. The company has answered the complaint, denying the charges.

"We have a diverse shipper base, with nearly 300 shippers," said Dunn. "We aim to provide value and the best offerings for a majority of shippers. We can't customize for every shipper."

Other companies, such as Murphy Oil, Vitol and Flint Resources LP have lodged complaints with FERC against Colonial in the past two years, but the latest action represents the largest threat to the operator's current rate structure.

"I expect given the importance of the line, the resources of the parties bringing the complaint and the number of shippers that use the line, this case will be heavily litigated and is very serious," said Tony Clark, a senior advisor at Wilkinson, Barker Knauer LLP and a FERC Commissioner from 2012 until 2016.

NEW YORK MONOPOLY

The companies say in the complaint that they were collectively overcharged by about $64.1 million between Oct. 1, 2015 and Sept. 30, 2017. They say Colonial's exorbitant and opaque fee structure pushed its 2016 interstate revenue to exceed its costs by $339.3 million, earning it about a 29 percent realized return on equity.

The companies said they used adjustments that accounted for, among other things, the cost of two pipeline outages in 2016 to arrive at that figure.

"The Commission has previously held that an apparent over-recovery of this magnitude...is more than sufficient to warrant setting for hearing a complaint against the pipeline rates," the complaint says.

Interstate pipelines are allowed to recover operating costs by charging shippers to use the line, but are prohibited from "over-recovery."

The U.S. Congress set Colonial's rates in 1990s-era legislation. In 2001, FERC allowed Colonial to charge market-based rates from the Gulf Coast to the Philadelphia and New York areas, on the understanding that Colonial lacked monopoly power over those markets. For other delivery points, such as Alabama and Georgia, Colonial rates are not market-based.

Colonial's market power raises serious concerns over whether its rates remain "just and reasonable," the complaint says. It says the market-based rate structure has not undergone scrutiny for years, while economic conditions have changed enough to warrant a review.

It may be hard for shippers to convince FERC that market-based rates are excessive, said FERC litigation partner Joseph Fagan, at Day Pitney LLP.

"Simply saying that they are charging rates that are very high and therefore they must have market power, that doesn't get you there ... Frustration does not a valid complaint make," he said.

Venezuela's oil sales to U.S. fell in Nov to lowest level since 2003 - 路透新闻

{{20171208T182425.064+0000}}Venezuela's oil sales to U.S. fell in Nov to lowest level since 2003HOUSTON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Venezuela's crude oil exports to the United States fell in November to their lowest level since January 2003, when a strike knocked down the country's output, due to sanctions and a steep production decline, according to Reuters data.

State-run oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] and its joint ventures sent 475,165 barrels per day to its customers in the United States last month, down 36 percent from a year earlier and 12 percent from October.

The South American country has lost 1 million bpd of production in the last four years and pumped less than 2 million bpd in October, according to official numbers reported to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.

The fast output decline has led PDVSA to request more crude from its Orinoco Belt joint ventures for its domestic refineries, affecting the volume available for exports and also hitting PDVSA's cash flow in foreign currency.

PDVSA is taking growing volumes of the valuable Hamaca crude from its Petropiar joint venture with U.S. oil company Chevron Corp and using it for domestic refining. [nL1N1NK1ZX]

As a result, the volume of Hamaca crude exported to the United States fell to less than 33,000 bpd in November from an average of 106,000 bpd last year, according to Reuters trade flows data.

PDVSA's refining unit in the United States, Citgo Petroleum, received 65,000 bpd of Venezuelan crude last month versus supply contracts that allow up to 220,000 bpd. But U.S.-based Valero Energy Corp's imports of Venezuelan crude rose to 194,000 bpd in November.

Sanctions imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration on Venezuela, including PDVSA's debt, have affected the ability of the company's customers to get letters of credit needed to complete some imports as banks avoid getting involved in transactions with the country. [nL2N1L31EK] [nL2N1LV2CE]

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said last month that the nation of 30 million people would try to restructure its burgeoning foreign debt. In the following weeks, a "selective default" has been declared by credit agencies as the country and PDVSA have not paid some of its debt service on time. [nL2N1N905O] [nL1N1NK0JC] [nL1N1NM2FY]

By Sonali Paul

MELBOURNE, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp paid no tax in Australia in the 2016 financial year, the third year in a row, despite reporting billions of dollars in income from operations in the country, a report from the tax office showed on Thursday.

Exxon Mobil, which has oil and gas production in the Bass Strait and a stake in the giant Gorgon LNG project among other assets in Australia, reported A$6.7 billion ($5.0 billion) in income, but it reported a loss for taxable income and paid no tax, similar to the previous two years.

Exxon said it had no taxable income as it has invested nearly A$18 billion over the past few years on major projects including Gorgon and the Kipper Tuna Turrum field.

"As these multi-billion investments were completed in 2017 and have started production, the amount of tax paid by ExxonMobil Australia is anticipated to increase significantly," said Travis Parnaby, a spokesman for the oil major.

Chevron reported A$2.1 billion in income for 2016 and paid no tax, while Shell Energy Holdings Australia - a unit of Royal Dutch Shell - reported A$4.2 billion in income and A$97 million in taxable income, but paid no tax.

Chevron, operator of the Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG projects, said it expects to pay significant taxes once those projects are running at full tilt. Shell is also a partner in Gorgon LNG.

The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) started requiring big companies to disclose their tax payments two years ago in a push to curb alleged tax avoidance.

Top global miners BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto and the oil and gas giants have all been accused of shifting income to countries like the Netherlands and Singapore where tax rates are lower.

A probe by the Australian Senate into corporate tax avoidance that began in 2014 was extended this week, and is now due to issue a final report by the end of May 2018.

In New Zealand, the new Labour government on Thursday proposed legislation to prevent multinationals from shifting profits out of the country. Its tax office estimated the measures could raise about NZ$200 million ($137 million) a year.

"Multinational companies are a welcome part of our economy but they must abide by the rules. They must pay their fair share of tax," New Zealand Revenue Minister Stuart Nash said in a statement.

Australia's and New Zealand's company tax rates are 30 percent and 28 percent respectively. The Netherlands has a 25 percent rate.

BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie defended the company's tax payments this week, after Australian Tax Commissioner Chris Jordan was quoted in The Australian newspaper saying the ATO might take BHP and Rio Tinto to court to resolve questions about marketing hubs in Singapore, where the miners pay minimal tax.

Mackenzie said the fight with the tax office related to about 1 or 2 percent of BHP's total tax payable in Australia.

"We pay our fair share," Mackenzie told the Melbourne Mining Club on Tuesday.

The tax office won a landmark case against Chevron earlier this year over a disputed A$340 million tax bill stemming from an intercompany loan with an exorbitantly high interest rate. [nL4N1L427Q]

"On the back of solid growth in company profits and higher commodity prices, we are seeing a strong increase in company tax collections in 2016-17 which will be reflected in the data next year," Australia's Deputy Tax Commissioner Jeremy Hirschhorn said in a statement released with the tax data.

UPDATE 1-Chevron projects $18.3 bln spending budget, down 4 pct  - 路透新闻

{{20171207T021810.776+0000}}UPDATE 1-Chevron projects $18.3 bln spending budget, down 4 pct (Adds detail on capital expenditures and past cuts)

By Gary McWilliams

HOUSTON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp , the second largest U.S.-based oil producer, is budgeting $18.3 billion for capital projects next year, the company said on Wednesday, about 4 percent less than this year and lower for a fourth year in a row.

International energy company capital budgets, closely watched for indications of future oil and gas production, broadly have been shrinking after 2014's oil-price collapse slashed earnings and left many with high debt loads.

In Chevron's case, the sharp declines coincide with its spending winding down on several long-term and costly projects in Australia and elsewhere. Capital and exploratory spending in the first nine months of this year was about half that of three years ago, a company spokeswoman said.

The 2018 budget reflects "project completions, improved efficiencies and investment high-grading," said Chief Executive John Watson in a statement. Spending on shale will rise to $4.3 billion overall this year, said Watson, who will retire early next year. [nBw7L0v7Ha]

The San Ramon, California-based company expects expenditures this year to be less than $19 billion, down from the $19.8 billion it estimated a year ago. It has told investors that capital spending between 2018 and 2020 would range from $17 billion to $22 billion a year.

Next year, Chevron expects to spend $15.8 billion on oil and gas exploration, $2.2 billion on refining, marketing and petrochemicals, and about $300 million for its share of affiliated company spending.

Most oil producers have yet to disclose their 2018 budgets, which generally are released in December and January. Analysts expect companies to pledge to keep 2018 spending in check and focus on reducing debt and boosting cash flow.

Chevron shares were off 78 cents at $119.61 in trading on Wednesday and are up less than 2 percent this year.

Kazakh leader tells cabinet: Make state firms move cash home or you're fired - 路透新闻

{{20171206T180050.038+0000}}Kazakh leader tells cabinet: Make state firms move cash home or you're firedASTANA, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev threatened on Wednesday to sack his cabinet if they failed to make large state companies bring back cash held abroad.

Nazarbayev, who wields sweeping powers in the oil-rich nation, also poured scorn on executives in private sector companies who, he suggested, were enjoying lavish lifestyles while keeping funds in foreign accounts.

"Enough of toying around, look at them, carried away with their games, keeping their money abroad, buying yachts and mansions in multiple countries," he said at a meeting with central government and regional officials.

"It is safer to keep money here, at home, we will ensure it is safe."

Nazarbayev ordered Prime Minister Bakytzhan Sagintayev to investigate why state-controlled companies had tripled their foreign cash holdings to $6 billion in the first half of 2017. He did not cite a source for that figure.

"If you fail to do this, I warn you in front of the whole Kazakhstan, I will use other ways to return that money to Kazakhstan, but you will not be here any more," he told his cabinet.

Nazarbayev said he also expected private sector companies to move cash back, citing Tengizchevroil, a joint venture led by Chevron , and state firm KazMunayGaz , as examples of groups keeping funds in foreign accounts.

"Tengizchevroil $4.5 billion, National Company KazMunayGaz - $3 billion, KazMunaiGas Exploration and Production - $2 billion." Again, he did not give a source for those figures.

Tengizchevroil said it would comment later this week and KazMunayGaz could not immediately be reached for comment.

"Why are you doing this? You keep your money there while profiting from Kazakhstan's resources. Why is this money not being put to work in Kazakhstan?" Nazarbayev said.

Citing central bank data, he said some companies had also abused liberal foreign exchange regulations to delay the transfer to Kazakhstan of $7.7 billion in export revenue.

UPDATE 2-Lacklustre drilling campaign cuts interest in Norwegian oil licensing round - 路透新闻

{{20171205T134250.081+0000}}UPDATE 2-Lacklustre drilling campaign cuts interest in Norwegian oil licensing round* 11 firms apply vs 26 firms in previous round

* Statoil, Lundin Petroleum, Aker BP among applicants

* Firms not applying: Chevron, Conoco, Lukoil, Tullow

(Recasts, adds quotes, Castberg field development)

OSLO, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Norway's attractiveness as an oil region took a hit on Tuesday when energy authorities said 11 oil firms applied for stakes in exploration blocks off Norway in its latest oil licensing round, less than half the number that applied in the previous round.

A disappointing drilling campaign this year in the Arctic Barents Sea - where oil companies did not make a single significant discovery - was the main factor discouraging oil companies from taking part in the 24th licencing round, industry experts said. [nL8N1MK1HD]

"Clearly the results of the exploration campaign in the Barents Sea this year have impacted the number of companies applying," said Helge Andre Martinsen, an analyst at DNB Markets.

"Overall exploration results this year have been extremely disappointing: dry wells and less volumes than expected," he added, citing in particular Statoil's Korpfjell prospect, for which expectations were high. [nL8N1LF1D4]

"The only thing that can turn this around is the upcoming Barents Sea campaign in 2018," he said.

Oil and gas are the Nordic country's largest industry, accounting for 12 percent of GDP. To replace existing output, new discoveries must be made and authorities expect them to be in the Barents Sea. After 2022, Norway has no major oil projects in the pipeline.

The number of firms applying for licences this year compares with 26 companies seeking drilling permits in the previous round in 2015. If all 11 applicants are awarded acreage, the 24th round would still be at a 15-year low in terms of participants. [nL8N1MK1HD]

Statoil, the largest explorer and producer off Norway, plans to drill five or six wells in the Barents Sea next year [nL8N1NY1MG]. Earlier on Tuesday it announced a $6 billion development plan for the Johan Castberg field in the Arctic. [nL8N1O50OW]

The oil and energy ministry said the latest licensing round is mainly about getting exploration going in key areas in Norway's least explored areas. Awards will be made in June 2018, it said in a statement.

In this licensing round, which focused on the Barents Sea, applicants included Statoil , Aker BP , Lundin Petroleum , Shell , OMV , Centrica , DEA and Wintershall .

Idemitsu <5019.T>, KUFPEC and RN Nordic Oil, a subsidiary of Rosneft , were also on the list of applicants.

Those that did not apply but applied in previous years included Chevron , ConocoPhillips , Lukoil , Tullow Oil and PGNiG .

The limited interest in the round does have a positive side for some of the firms taking part. "For Statoil, Aker BP and Lundin Petroleum, it is less competition," said Martinsen.

The government offered a total of 102 exploration blocks, consisting of 93 blocks in the Barents Sea and nine in the Norwegian Sea, although it is expected to narrow this down based on the interest expressed by oil firms.

By Ron Bousso and Ernest Scheyder

LONDON/VIENNA, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil is considering a foray into Egypt offshore oil and gas, seeking to replicate rivals' success in the country and boost its reserves, officials and industry sources said.

Officials from the world's largest listed oil producer recently held talks with Egypt's petroleum ministry to discuss investments in oil and gas production, known as upstream operations, Petroleum Minister Tarek El Molla told Reuters.

"We have been discussing with them, visiting them. They've visited us... We are exploring all opportunities for having more and further upstreamers in Egypt," Molla said on the sidelines of an OPEC meeting in Vienna.

"I would be happy to have them with us," he said, adding that no decision has been made yet.

Exxon declined to comment. The Irving, Texas-based company currently has no upstream operations in Egypt, according to its website.

The company is looking at exploring the eastern Mediterranean offshore basin, according to industry sources.

Italy's Eni this month is set to begin producing gas from the Zohr field in the Mediterranean, among the biggest discoveries of the past decade.

"After Zohr there was a reassessment of the portfolio profitability in Egypt" by Exxon, one source said, adding that Exxon was looking for "tier one assets" with significant potential.

Exxon is also considering opportunities in the Red Sea, where Cairo is preparing to tender exploration blocks, industry sources briefed on the matter told Reuters.

Egypt in 2016 had reserves of 3.5 billion barrels of oil and 1.8 trillion cubic metres of gas, according to BP's Statistical Review of World Energy.

RESERVES

Egypt has recently ramped up efforts to attract foreign investment in its oil sector to boost its struggling economy.

Along with Eni, BP and Royal Dutch Shell also have significant operations in Egypt in offshore gas production, which is consumed domestically although Cairo aims to become a gas exporter.

Exxon like many rivals has curbed spending to ride out a sharp fall in oil prices in mid-2014.

With its reserves slipping, Exxon CEO Darren Woods, who took over at the beginning of the year, has gone shopping.

Woods has spent or authorised more than $10 billion in investment in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield, and in offshore Guyana. [nL4N1F74E1][nL3N1JD3UC]

In November, Exxon and Japan's Inpex Corp <1605.T> signed an agreement with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) to boost the capacity of the Upper Zakum offshore oilfield, the world's fourth largest.

Exxon is also close to signing a deal to explore for oil and gas off Mauritania, its oil, energy and mines director said on Wednesday. [nL1N1NZ11N]

In 2016, Exxon's stockpile of total proved oil reserves fell 4 percent to 7.75 billion barrels. [nL5N1HB4U4]

In addition, the oil in its portfolio is in hard-to-reach or expensive places, including Russia and Canada.

By comparison, rival Chevron Corp has been able to boost its proved oil reserves by about 1 percent since 2014 by expanding in the Permian Basin and Kazakhstan.

Exxon's oil production up to the end of the third quarter stood at 3.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, down about 6 percent from the end of 2016.

{{20171201T001752.895+0000}}UPDATE 1-Chevron to study Mexican oil block, no drilling seen in first 4 years(Adds investment details)

By David Alire Garcia

MEXICO CITY, Nov 30 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron Corp will focus on studying the geology of its block in Mexico's deepwater Gulf during the first four-year phase of its contract, rather than drilling new wells, a senior executive said on Thursday.

The company, which leads a consortium that includes Mexican state oil firm Pemex [PEMX.UL] and Japan's Inpex <1605.T>, won the rights to deepwater Block 3 at auction late last year.

The exploration plan calls for the consortium to invest $37 million over four years, according to the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH), which expects to approve the plan in January.

The auction for rights was part of a sweeping 2013-14 energy reform that ended Pemex's decades-long monopoly, as the government sought to reverse a decade of declining oil and gas production.

"Block 3 is very complicated and we want to use these first few years to better understand the geology," said Evelyn Vilchez, Chevron's top executive for exploration and production projects in Mexico, at a briefing with reporters in Mexico City.

The block is located in the productive Perdido Fold Belt which straddles the U.S.-Mexico maritime border.

Commercial production will likely take between 10 to 16 years to begin, with the time frame depending on successful exploration efforts plus other factors, she added.

Chevron has previously said it is also entering into Mexico's newly opened retail fuel market, with plans to open 350 gas stations over the next three years.

The firm currently has six gas stations in three northwestern Mexican states with plans to open more shortly, said Jose Parra, Chevron's downstream executive for Mexico.

It will initially supply them with Pemex gasoline, until other transportation and storage infrastructure projects can be brought online in the next few years, Parra said.

Earlier this week, Mexico's finance ministry moved ahead by one month a long-awaited liberalization of fuel prices, previously scheduled for Dec. 30.

The government also published a tax and subsidy scheme designed to allow it to reduce the impact of abrupt price variations, seen by analysts as a way for it to avoid price spikes ahead of elections next year.

For many years prior to the passage of the energy reform, fuel and electricity prices were set by the government.

UPDATE 2-Chevron, Total, PetroChina may develop Iraq's Majnoon oilfield - Reuters Gulf Financial News

(Adds refineries' rehabilitation)

By Ahmad Ghaddar

VIENNA, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Chevron, Total and PetroChina may form a consortium to develop Iraq's Majnoon oilfield which Royal Dutch Shell wants to exit, Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said in Vienna on Thursday.

Shell plans to exit Majnoon and hand over its operation to state-run Basra Oil Co. by the end of June 2018.

Iraq is developing the Majnoon field, which currently produces around 235,000 barrels of oil per day, by itself until it can find a foreign partner.

Luaibi said in October that Iraq might offer Chevron and Total terms to develop the Majnoon oilfield that were different to those given to Shell, which has said it wants to leave because of unfavourable changes to fiscal terms.

Iraq expects its refining capacity to increase by 100,000 barrels per day by mid-2018 with the rehabilitation of two refineries retaken from the Islamic State.

The rehabilitation of Kisik refinery, near Mosul, should add 30,000 bpd in processing capacity before the end of the year, and Salahuddin 70,000 bpd within six months, he said.
