UPDATE 1-Venezuela court move may facilitate Russian investment, spook other oil majors - 路透新闻

{{20170331T173319.303+0000}}UPDATE 1-Venezuela court move may facilitate Russian investment, spook other oil majors(Recasts headline, adds context, link)

By Alexandra Ulmer

March 31 (Reuters) - The sight of Venezuela's National Assembly president tearing up a Supreme Court ruling and warning foreign firms against making deals with the leftist government will no doubt resonate in international boardrooms.

The ruling ripped up by Congress head Julio Borges on Thursday was designed to allow President Nicolas Maduro to create oil ventures without congressional approval, easing investment in the cash-strapped country's floundering oil industry.

And it may well facilitate deals with companies including Russia oil major Rosneft , which Reuters reported earlier this month had been offered a stake in an oil joint venture with Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] as part of a broader deal with Caracas' key ally. [nL2N1GT1M4]

But the ensuing muddy legal framework and international outcry is likely to further raise anxiety levels at foreign oil companies already nervous about buying oil field stakes in Venezuela because of the country's shaky finances, as well as stricter regulatory scrutiny at home, according to oil executives, lawyers, and other industry sources.

Under the Venezuelan constitution, Congress must approve contracts of "national public interest" with foreign companies. But the Supreme Court just ruled Congress does not have a say over joint ventures anymore, while lawmakers retort the top court is illegitimate, creating a legal maze.

That bodes poorly for Venezuela's ravaged economy, which depends on oil shipments for over 90 percent of its export revenue as millions skip meals due to food shortages and roaring inflation. [nL2N1GR0O1] [nL2N1GZ2BS]

"This complicates any investment decision," said a Caracas-based source at a foreign oil company that partners with PDVSA, asking to remain anonymous because the person was not allowed to speak to media.

Still, Russia is becoming an increasingly crucial financier for isolated Maduro at a time when many other foreign companies were already reluctant to pour money into Venezuela given the poor business climate and debts.

And should Venezuela manage to pull off further sales or loans with Rosneft, that could help Venezuela make some $2.5 billion in bond payments due in April and shoulder other operational costs.

But while Venezuela may receive a short term boost from the decision, in the long-term foreign oil companies will likely be stymied from potential further investments in the country with the world's biggest crude reserves.

PDVSA and the oil ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Rosneft declined to comment, as did U.S. major Chevron Corp , which has four joint venture operations with PDVSA.

Spain's Repsol, which last year extended a $1.2 billion credit line to bolster a joint venture it has with PDVSA, also declined to comment. [nL2N1CD1CC]

Other foreign oil companies operating in Venezuela, including state-run China National Petroleum Corp <601857.SS>, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

SPOOKED INVESTORS

But for the low-profile foreign oil companies which remain in Venezuela despite a wave of nationalizations and company exits, the Supreme Court ruling is another worry amid complex currency controls, a brain drain, and out-of-control crime.

Many companies were already concerned about Venezuela's legal framework after the opposition took control of the National Assembly in January 2016 and warned oil majors that investment deals affecting national interest required their approval.

When Rosneft bought a stake in the Petromonagas joint venture early last year, the National Assembly slammed the purchase as "illegal" because it bypassed the legislature. Rosneft responded that the deal was legal.

And, bucking international condemnation of what Maduro opponents have called a slide into dictatorship, Moscow on Friday urged the world to leave Venezuela alone.

"External forces should not add fuel to the fire to the conflict inside Venezuela," the Russian government said.

Some companies may also be betting that they would have enough muscle to negotiate with a hypothetical opposition-led government in the future to "legalize" any purchases made without the congressional green light, sources say.

But the recent Supreme Court move is unlikely to assuage the fears of foreign partners who have strict internal compliance and legal guidelines, especially as protests and international condemnation grow. [nL2N1H80DA]

"This doesn't solve the problem," said Francisco Monaldi, fellow in Latin American energy policy at the Baker Institute in Houston.

"It might for the Russians, but I doubt an international company would dare do anything here. This can definitely put a brake on the creation of new joint ventures."

UPDATE 1-Petrobras eyes five major assets in new divestment program - 路透新闻

{{20170331T134422.983+0000}}UPDATE 1-Petrobras eyes five major assets in new divestment program(Adds details on assets, context)

By Bruno Federowski

SAO PAULO, March 31 (Reuters) - Brazil's state-run oil company Petróleo Brasileiro SA is eyeing five major assets for a renewed divestment program to be formalized in the next two weeks, after a court forced it to restart most of its $21 billion asset sale program from scratch.

In a securities filing on Friday, Petrobras, as the firm is known, said new divestments may include fuel distribution unit BR Distribuidora, shallow offshore fields in the states of Sergipe and Ceará, the Baúna and Tartaruga Verde oil fields in the Santos and Campos Basins, onshore fields in the state of Sergipe, and deepwater rights in the Gulf of Mexico.

The ruling by Brazil's federal audit court earlier this month allowed Petrobras to proceed with the sale of liquefied gas unit Liquigas, gas pipeline unit NTS and petrochemical companies Suape and Citepe, which already had firm buyers. [nL2N1GS243]

The sale of a stake in the Saint Malo field in the Gulf of Mexico was also exempted from the court ruling, but Petrobras said it would be called off because it "did not achieve the expected results," without elaborating.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that Petrobras scrapped the sale of the Baúna and Tartaruga Verde fields because the deal fell through after the Australian buyer's partner backed out amid protracted legal challenges in Brazil. [nE6N1FG01G]

Since Chief Executive Pedro Parente took charge in May 2016, Petrobras has pursued aggressive asset sales as it sought to cut the largest debt burden among global oil firms.

The Brazilian firm is particularly keen on restarting the sale process of BR Distribuidora, the country's largest fuel distributor and retailer, with 7,500 gas stations nationwide.

UPDATE 1-Chevron starts production at Gorgon Train Three LNG project - 路透新闻

{{20170328T042530.298+0000}}UPDATE 1-Chevron starts production at Gorgon Train Three LNG project* Third and final production train at Gorgon plant starts up

* Production at Gorgon Train Two suspended on March 27

* Reliability of Train Three in question -traders

* Spot LNG supplies could rise on Train Three startup -traders

(Adds details on Train 2 outage, trader comments)

By Mark Tay

SINGAPORE, March 28 (Reuters) - Chevron has started production of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the third of three production units at the Gorgon LNG project located off Western Australia, the company said on Tuesday.

Chevron is the operator of the $54 billion project that has a total of three production trains with a combined production capacity of 15.6 million tonnes per year.

First production of the supercooled fuel from Gorgon began in March last year, but the plant has been plagued by numerous unplanned outages since then.

Chevron most recently suspended production at its Gorgon Train Two production line on March 27. [nL3N1H43V8]

"We just need to see how reliable that is," a Singapore-based LNG trader said, referring to the plant's troubled production history. "People learnt from previous Gorgon and Angola trains that we need to see how stable their production is."

The Train Three startup could add to the existing supply glut in the Asian LNG spot market because some of the production volumes from the new production line are not committed to buyers, a second trading source said.

"They might do more of the prompt tenders," the source added.

Asian spot LNG prices have fallen by 45 percent since early January to $5.40 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) amid new production coming on stream in Australia and the United States.

Chevron holds a controlling stake of 47.3 percent in the project, while ExxonMobil and Shell each have a 25 percent stake. The remaining stakes are held by Osaka Gas, Tokyo Gas and JERA.

were now set at 1.61 million barrels per day (bpd) from 52
cargoes, down from 1.67 million bpd from 54 cargoes initially.

The source said the two cargo loadings removed and pushed
into June were an end-month Dalia that was with Sonangol and a
Cabinda that was set to load with ENI.

Under the deal with the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other nations, Angola agreed to
cut 78,000 bpd from a reference production level of 1.751
million bpd.

So far this year, Angola's production and exports have been
well below the target but several fields are coming into
production or ramping up, including Chevron's  Mafumeira
Sul and Eni's  West Hub and East Hub projects.

UPDATE 1-Chevron suspends production at Gorgon Train Two LNG project - 路透新闻

{{20170327T114537.712+0000}}UPDATE 1-Chevron suspends production at Gorgon Train Two LNG project(Adds details of Gorgon sell tender)

By Mark Tay

SINGAPORE, March 27 (Reuters) - Chevron has temporarily suspended production of liquefied natural gas (LNG) at its Gorgon Train Two production line in Australia, the company said on Monday.

The Chevron-operated Gorgon LNG plant has suffered several shutdowns since it first began producing gas in October.

Chevron, which holds a controlling 47.3 percent stake in the Gorgon project located off Western Australia, suspended production at the Train Two facility at the end of February but resumed production days later. [nL4N1G92TN][nL5N1GC1ZU]

"Production at Gorgon Train Two is being temporarily suspended for a planned turnaround to enhance the train's reliability in alignment with previously arranged strategies," a Chevron spokesman said in an email statement, without saying when Chevron planned to restart the production line.

"The remainder of the plant production continues to be steady," the spokesman said, adding that the turnaround would allow for modification works to improve the capacity and reliability of a key flow measuring device on the train.

ExxonMobil, which has a 25 percent stake in the $54 billion Gorgon project, had previously issued a spot tender to sell a cargo of the supercooled fuel for loading over March 25-26, two traders with knowledge of the tender said.

The tender, which was due to close on Monday, has since been cancelled. It is unclear if the cargo was eventually loaded, the traders added.

Gorgon LNG most recently loaded a cargo of LNG on to the Chevron-owned tanker Asia Endeavour on March 24 for delivery to North Asia, Thomson Reuters Eikon trade flows data shows.

UPDATE 3-World's top LNG buyers form alliance to push for flexible contracts - 路透新闻

{{20170323T155538.045+0000}}UPDATE 3-World's top LNG buyers form alliance to push for flexible contracts* S.Korea's KOGAS, Japan's JERA, China's CNOOC sign MOU

* Top LNG buyers to work together to get flexible LNG contracts

* Glut means producers are under pressure to grant concessions

(Recasts, adds background on buyers' clubs, producer comments, Qatar official, detail on WTO and market impact)

By Jane Chung, Yuka Obayashi and Oleg Vukmanovic

SEOUL/TOKYO/MILAN, March 23 (Reuters) - The world's biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) buyers, all in Asia, are clubbing together to secure more flexible supply contracts in a move which shifts power to importers from producers as oversupply grows.

Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) said on Thursday it had signed a memorandum of understanding in mid-March with Japan's JERA and China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) to exchange information and "cooperate in the joint procurement of LNG."

Together, the three companies purchase a third of global LNG production, giving them a strong hand to challenge restrictive contract terms that have squeezed buyers' finances.

Influential buyers' clubs are largely unheard of in commodity markets where it is the producers, such as the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), who wield power, enforcing production quotas to manage prices.

A painful period of high LNG prices before 2014 left Asian importers scrambling to contain losses and led to the first talks between India, Japan, South Korea, China and Taiwan about joint purchases.

Several joint LNG-buying deals have been set up since then but none approach the scale of the latest agreement, which is the first involving the game's biggest players.

Under Thursday's agreement, the buyers aim to extract concessions from producers that would give them supply flexibility, such as having the right to re-sell imports to third parties, something they are not allowed to do currently under so-called destination restrictions.

"We have created a platform to share, discuss and solve our common issues such as traditional LNG business practices, including destination restrictions," said JERA spokesman Atsuo Sawaki.

The alliance of three big buyers across three countries will put pressure on exporters such as Qatar, Australia and Malaysia. They prefer to have clients locked into fixed supply contracts which run for decades and make buyers take fixed amounts of monthly volumes irrespective of demand, with no right to re-sell surplus supplies to other end-users.

'MARKET CRUNCH'

The agreement has been helped by the fact the power wielded by OPEC is unparalleled in the commodities world. Attempts to create an OPEC-style body through the Gas Exporting Countries Forum has failed to gain traction because gas and LNG markets are more fragmented than oil, while similar moves in coffee, railroads, rubber and tin have all collapsed over the decades.

The LNG market is undergoing huge changes as the biggest ever flood of new supply is hitting the market, with volumes coming mainly from Australia and the United States.

JERA, KOGAS and CNOOC will all struggle with having excess supplies in the next few years, sources at three major LNG producers told Reuters, curbing the consortium's ability to strike any new deals this decade.

Reworking existing deals, however, is feasible and may hit the world's biggest producer Qatar the hardest as many of its mid-term supply deals with Japan start to expire from around 2023, industry sources said.

A senior Qatar Petroleum official hinted that buyers - emboldened by temporarily oversupplied markets to demand better terms - may come to regret their actions when the cycle turns.

"Right now the market is over-supplied but if we went into a period of a tighter market, how would these buyers organisations hold up? That is an important question," the official said.

"If there is a market crunch and gas tightens it could recreate incentives for buyers to lock in long-term contracts."

More practically, the deal complements the buying habits of each company - KOGAS largely buys for winter, CNOOC for summer and JERA across both seasons - offering opportunities for swapping cargoes, industry sources said.

"Flexibility is becoming critical for LNG buyers ... as the rise of solar capacity is going to make consumption of LNG more seasonal," said Kerry Anne Shanks, head of LNG research for Asia/Pacific at Wood Mackenzie.

PRESSURE ON PRODUCERS

New production has resulted in global installed LNG capacity of over 300 million tonnes a year, while only around 268 million tonnes of LNG were traded in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data.

That has helped pull down Asian spot LNG prices by more than 70 percent from their 2014 peaks to $5.65 per million British thermal units (mmBtu).

It has also given importers more suppliers to choose from, putting pressure on major producers like Royal Dutch Shell , Chevron , ExxonMobil and Woodside Petroleum to grant more flexible contract terms.

Companies forming cartels are difficult to challenge at the World Trade Organization, which does not have rules about anti-competitive behaviour and only governs trade relations between member countries. But WTO rules do oblige state-run firms to trade on commercial and non-discriminatory terms.

Thomas Cottier, a law professor and senior research fellow at the World Trade Institute at the University of Bern, said the LNG alliance may or may not comply with the WTO rules.

"To the extent that governments are directly or indirectly involved, it may violate rules on state trading or the prohibition to encourage voluntary export restraints. However, conduct of private companies is subject to domestic anti-trust law and is not part of WTO law," he told Reuters by email.

Even if an LNG supplier such as Qatar, Russia or Australia launched a dispute at the WTO, several other major gas producers such as Iran and Turkmenistan are not members of the WTO and therefore have no right to have their complaints heard there.

UPDATE 1-Statoil wins licences off UK, "resets" exploration off U.S. - 路透新闻

{{20170323T142536.308+0000}}UPDATE 1-Statoil wins licences off UK, "resets" exploration off U.S.* Bids $44.5 mln for 13 licences in U.S. Gulf of Mexico

* Says "resets" exploration campaign offshore U.S.

* Wins six licences, including five operated, in UK

(Combines British, U.S. strands)

OSLO, March 23 (Reuters) - Norway's Statoil was the second top bidder for 13 oil exploration leases in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and won six licences offshore Britain, it said on Thursday, in a sign it may be looking to boost reserves after slashing costs.

"The importance of oil companies' ability to replenish reserves after several years of spending cuts is increasing as oil prices stabilize, brokerage RBC Capital Markets said in a note on Thursday."

Statoil bid a total of $44.5 million for 13 licences in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, coming second only to Shell and ahead of Hess Corp , Chevron and Exxon , the latest auction results showed. [nL2N1GZ29E]

The company said in a separate statement it had won five new operated licences in the northern North Sea and one in the frontier area west of Scotland, committing to drill at least three wells.

Statoil said its bids for licences in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico meant that the company was "resetting" its exploration campaign there, two months after saying it was considering whether to end it due to poor results. [nL5N1EW13J]

"We continue to believe in the potential of the Gulf of Mexico," Statoil's Tore Loeseth, head of exploration in the U.S. and Mexico, said in a statement.

Statoil's spokesman said the company believed it could be more successful based on the analysis of the seismic data and the lessons from the previous drilling.

The U.S. auctions results are subject to a 90-days formal review and final approval, with no commitment to drill.

Statoil, however, would have to hand back its licences if it fails to spud wells in 5-10 years, depending on water depths.

The company expected its offshore U.S. production to nearly double by 2020 from about 60,000 barrels per day in 2016.

The tender in Britain, which received bids last year, attracted the lowest interest in 14 years, reflecting the drop in appetite for finding new oil in the North Sea due to high costs and weak oil prices. [nL8N1D12MZ]

Brent crude price were trading at over $50 a barrel most of the time in 2017, up from over $40 a barrel in 2016.

INSIGHT-As Trump targets energy rules, oil companies downplay their impact - 路透新闻

{{20170323T110002.463+0000}}INSIGHT-As Trump targets energy rules, oil companies downplay their impactBy Richard Valdmanis

BOSTON, March 23 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's White House has said his plans to slash environmental regulations will trigger a new energy boom and help the United States drill its way to independence from foreign oil.

But the top U.S. oil and gas companies have been telling their shareholders that regulations have little impact on their business, according to a Reuters review of U.S. securities filings from the top producers.

In annual reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 13 of the 15 biggest U.S. oil and gas producers said that compliance with current regulations is not impacting their operations or their financial condition.

The other two made no comment about whether their businesses were materially affected by regulation, but reported spending on compliance with environmental regulations at less than 3 percent of revenue.

The dissonance raises questions about whether Trump's war on regulation can increase domestic oil and gas output, as he has promised, or boost profits and share prices of oil and gas companies, as some investors have hoped.

According to the SEC, a publicly traded company must deem a matter "material" and report it to the agency if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important.

"Materiality is a fairly low bar," said Cary Coglianese, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who runs the university's research program on regulation. "Despite exaggerated claims, regulatory costs are usually a very small portion of many companies' cost of doing business."

The oil majors' annual filings come after the industry and its political allies have spent years criticizing the Obama administration for policies aimed at reducing fossil-fuel consumption, curtailing drilling on federal lands and subsidizing renewable energy.

Trump promised during the campaign that a rollback of the Democratic administration's policies would help free the nation from reliance on imported oil.

"Under my presidency, we will accomplish complete American energy independence," said Trump, describing regulation as a "self-inflicted wound."

The Trump administration is now preparing an executive order - dubbed the "Energy Independence" executive order - to roll back Obama-era regulations, which could be signed as early as this month, according to administration officials.

U.S. presidents have aimed to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, which triggered soaring prices. But the United States still imports about 7.9 million barrels of crude oil a day - almost enough meet total oil demand in Japan and India combined.

"ENERGY RENASSAINCE"

The Trump administration's attacks on regulation have been applauded by the oil industry.

"We haven't seen 3 percent growth in the economy for eight years, and I think part of the reason is that we've had a heavy dose of regulation," Chevron Corp. CEO John Watson said at CERAWeek, a global energy conference in Houston this month.

Continental Resources CEO, Harold Hamm, who advised Trump on energy issues during his campaign for the White House, told the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July that stripping regulation could allow the country to double its production of oil and gas, triggering a new "American energy renaissance."

Yet Continental's annual report, filed last month with the SEC, says environmental regulation - after eight years under the Obama administration - does not have a "material adverse effect on our operations to any greater degree than other similarly situated competitors."

Continental's competitors who reported actual spending on environmental compliance told investors that such expenses amount to a small percentage of operating revenues.

Fourteen of the 15 companies whose filings were reviewed by Reuters declined to comment on their statements to investors or the impact of regulation on their profits.

A spokesman for ConocoPhillips acknowledged that regulatory compliance has not had a material adverse impact on the company's liquidity or financial position. But red tape can be an unwelcome burden nonetheless.

"Changing, excessive, overlapping, duplicative and potentially conflicting regulations increase costs, cause potential delays and negatively impact investment decisions, with great cost to consumers of energy," the spokesman, Daren Beaudo, said in a written statement.

The American Petroleum Institute - which represents the U.S. oil and gas industry - also declined to comment.

Last month, before the U.S. Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, API President Jack Gerard said that the oil and gas industry has surged forward despite onerous regulations under the Obama administration.

"Technological innovations and industry leadership have propelled the oil and gas industry forward despite the unprecedented onslaught of 145 new and pending federal regulatory actions targeting our industry."

Though the industry saw a staunch opponent in Obama, oil and gas production soared more than 50 percent during his presidency. That was mainly because of high oil prices and improved hydraulic fracturing, a drilling technology that has allowed producers to access new reserves in previously tough-to -reach shale formations.

The rush of production ultimately contributed to a global glut that dropped crude oil prices from a high of over $100 a barrel in early 2014 to a low of nearly $25 by 2016. Current prices hover near $50 a barrel.

NO "MATERIAL" IMPACT

Four of the 15 companies reviewed by Reuters reported that spending on environmental matters - including new equipment or facilities, as well as fines and compliance staffing - amounted to a small fraction of revenues.

Exxon Mobil reported spending $4.9 billion worldwide in 2016, or about 2.24 percent of gross revenue. Occidental Petroleum , a much smaller company, reported spending $285 million, or about 2.82 percent of revenue. Neither addressed whether the spending was "material" in their filings.

Two other companies, ConocoPhillips and Chevron, also broke out their environmental spending while reporting that regulation had no material impact on their business. Conoco spent $627 million in 2016, or about 2.57 percent of gross revenue, while Chevron spent $2.1 billion, or 1.91 percent of gross revenue.

The other 11 companies did not break out spending, but all of them told the SEC that environmental regulation did not have a material impact on their business.

In one typical statement, EOG Resources , one of the biggest U.S. producers, told investors in a report filed last month: "Compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases EOG's overall cost of business, but has not had, to date, a material adverse effect on EOG's operations, financial condition or results of operations."

Devon Energy Corp , Anadarko Petroleum Corp , Pioneer Natural Resources Co , Apache Corp , and other large U.S.-focused oil and gas drillers used similar wording.

"ABSENCE OF A NEGATIVE"

Still, Obama's exit - and Trump's win over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in November - has been enough to brighten the outlook of some big investors.

"I believe the absence of a negative is a positive," John Dowd, who manages several energy funds at Fidelity Investments, wrote in his 2017 energy outlook. "The market has been concerned with the sustainability of fracking, and particularly to what extent it might have been regulated into obscurity by a different election outcome."

Clinton had said during her campaign that she planned to increase regulation on fracking.

Other segments of the energy industry, such as coal mining and oil refining, were harder hit by environmental protection measures during Obama's presidency. Several coal companies went bankrupt in recent years and blamed Obama's climate change initiatives for raising costs and hurting demand.

Refiners have also long complained that environmental regulations have stymied attempts to build new refineries and that they have borne the brunt of costly rules requiring them to blend biofuels into their gasoline.

Still, some energy analysts and regulation experts point out that the biggest drivers for these industries, too, tend to be supply and demand – not regulation.

The abundance of cheap natural gas is seen as the biggest obstacle to reviving coal country, since both fuels compete for space in the furnaces of U.S. power plants. For refiners, the key driver for profitability is the differential between the price of their raw material, crude oil, and the fuels they make with it.

"Supply and demand are the fundamental forces driving markets," said Coglianese, the University of Pennsylvania law professor. "Regulation is relatively trivial."

Statoil "resets" exploration in U.S. Gulf of Mexico - 路透新闻

{{20170323T070811.946+0000}}Statoil "resets" exploration in U.S. Gulf of MexicoOSLO, March 23 (Reuters) - Norway's Statoil has "reset" its exploration campaign in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico by placing top bids for 13 offshore deepwater oil and gas leases there in the latest auction, the company said Thursday.

The majority state-owned company said in January it was considering whether to end its costly search for oil and gas in the region following a series of exploration failures. [nL5N1EW13J]

Statoil made total bids of $44.5 million in the auction, second only to Shell and ahead of Hess Corp , Chevron and Exxon .

The outcome will now be subject to a 90-days formal review and final approval. [nL2N1GZ29E]

"We continue to believe in the potential of the Gulf of Mexico," Statoil's Tore Loeseth, head of exploration in the U.S. and Mexico, said in a statement.

Statoil said it expected its offshore U.S. production to nearly double by 2020 from about 60,000 barrels per day in 2016.

Major oil companies open their wallets in Gulf of Mexico bidding - 路透新闻

{{20170323T012920.550+0000}}Major oil companies open their wallets in Gulf of Mexico biddingBy Ruthy Munoz

HOUSTON, March 22 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell plc, Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp signaled the oil industry's return to the Gulf of Mexico's deep waters with high bids in a government auction up 76 percent over a year ago.

The auction of offshore oil and gas parcels received nearly $275 million in high bids, compared with $156.4 million a year ago. The year-ago auction drew the fourth lowest total bids for leases in the central Gulf.

The oil industry had moved away from deep water projects as oil prices fell and regulatory scrutiny increased following the Deepwater Horizon disaster in April 2010, the largest accidental marine oil spill. The five-month-long spill, which spewed some 210 million U.S. gallons (780,000 m3) into the Gulf, caused extensive damage to marine and wildlife habitats, as well as to the area's fishing and tourism industries, forcing BP to sell assets worth of billions of dollars.

Wednesday's auction was the first under President Donald Trump, who has promised to cut permitting and regulatory hurdles in support of energy exploration.

Shell and Chevron each had 20 high bids, and Shell's $55.8 million total was the largest among the 26 companies submitting offers. Norway's Statoil ASA was the second-largest total bidder with $44.5 million, followed by Hess Corp , Chevron and Exxon.

"Today's strong sale reflects continued industry optimism and interest in the Gulf's Outer Continental Shelf, Department of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said in a statement.

The highest bid on a single block this year, from Shell, was for $24 million, almost twice last year's $13.6 million top offer. Among other top bidders, Exxon submitted 19 high bids totaling nearly $22 million, and Anadarko Petroleum had 16 high bids totaling nearly $19 million.

The bids will be evaluated for the next 90 days by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and winners disclosed following the review.

Interest in new deep-water projects is heating up with more favorable costs for drilling rigs, services and production equipment. Shell has cut its well costs by at least 50 percent and reduced logistics costs by three quarters, helping make deep-water projects affordable at crude prices under $50 a barrel.

Last month, the Anglo-Dutch oil giant gave final approval to go ahead with its Kaikias deep-water project in the Gulf. In December, BP said it planned to move ahead with a previously delayed expansion project known as Mad Dog Phase 2, the first new platform sanctioned for the Gulf in a year and a half.

UPDATE 1-Maersk reaches key North Sea tax deal with Denmark - 路透新闻

{{20170322T191126.521+0000}}UPDATE 1-Maersk reaches key North Sea tax deal with Denmark(Adds deal, details)

By Teis Jensen

COPENHAGEN, March 22 (Reuters) - Shipping and oil company A. P. Moller-Maersk on Wednesday reached an agreement with the Danish state that means it will pay less tax on its North Sea oil and gas activities through 2025.

The deal, which has been under negotiation for months, makes it viable to redevelop the Tyra field through which 90 percent of Denmark's gas production is processed, and it is seen as crucial for the Danish company that is seeking to spin off its energy assets via a listing or merger. [nL8N1BY11U]

Maersk and its partners in the Danish Underground Consortium (DUC) -- Shell , Chevron and state-owned Nordsofonden -- with whom it owns Tyra, will decide on the redevelopment of the field by the end of the year, Maersk said.

"We will now issue tenders and progress engineering work towards detailed plans in preparation of a final investment decision by end 2017," Maersk Oil's Chief Operating Officer, Martin Rune Pedersen said in a statement.

"Pending a final investment decision, production from Tyra is now expected to shut in December 2019 and restart in March 2022," Maersk Oil said.

The deal means the tax allowance on oil and gas production will be increased gradually over the next six years to 6.5 percent from 5 percent now, the finance ministry said.

The tax allowance will be withdrawn if the oil price rises to above $75 per barrel, the ministry said.

Tyra's platforms have sunk 5 metres since production began 30 years ago but Maersk has earlier said it would not be viable to redevelop it given the conditions offered by Denmark.

The deal will support investments of more than 10 billion Danish crowns ($1.5 billion) in oil and gas production in the North Sea, and could increase tax revenues by 26 billion crowns through 2042, the finance ministry said. ($1 = 6.8880 Danish crowns)

UPDATE 2-China's Sinopec buys first major refinery in Africa from Chevron - Reuters News

{{20170322T130910.658+0000}}UPDATE 2-China's Sinopec buys first major refinery in Africa from Chevron(Adds Chevron comments, details)

BEIJING, March 22 (Reuters) - China's Sinopec <600028.SS> <0386.HK> will pay almost $1 billion for a 75 percent stake in Chevron Corp's South African assets and its subsidiary in Botswana to secure its first major refinery in Africa, the companies announced on Wednesday.

China Petroleum and Chemical Corp, or Sinopec, Asia's largest oil refiner, said the assets include a 100,000 barrel-per-day oil refinery in Cape Town, a lubricants plant in Durban as well as 820 petrol stations and other oil storage facilities.

Chevron Global Energy Inc said in a statement that Sinopec's bid was selected in part because of the better terms and conditions it offered, including a commitment to operate the businesses as going concerns and the opportunity to reap strategic value for its longer-term strategy in Africa.

The deal, which includes 220 convenience stores across South Africa and Botswana, is subject to regulatory approval.

With a growing middle class, demand in South Africa for refined petroleum has increased by nearly 5 percent annually over the past five years, to a current total of about 27 million tonnes, Sinopec said.

Sinopec in 2012 partnered South Africa's national oil company PetroSA to help develop a new greenfields refinery that has subsequently been shelved due to high costs. It said it would retain the whole workforce as well as the existing Caltex brand for the retail fuel stations for up to six years before launching a rebranding strategy.

The remaining 25 percent of the South African assets will continue to be held by a group of local shareholders, in accordance with South African regulations.

Reuters reported on Friday that Sinopec was the last remaining bidder in the auction which lasted more than a year and drew interest from French oil firm Total and commodity traders Glencore and Gunvor. [nL3N1GU2HA]

* Assets estimated to be worth $1 billion -sources

* Chevron S. African assets include Cape Town refinery

* Deal would give Sinopec first refinery in Africa

(Adds details, background)

By Jessica Resnick-Ault and Florence Tan

NEW YORK/SINGAPORE, March 17 (Reuters) - China's Sinopec <600028.SS> is nearing a deal to buy Chevron's South African oil assets for up to $1 billion to secure its first major refinery on the continent, several people familiar with the matter said.

China Petroleum and Chemical Corp, or Sinopec, Asia's largest oil refiner, was the last bidder remaining, and close to a deal with Chevron after an auction that spanned more than a year for its refinery, retails business and storage terminals.

French oil firm Total and commodity traders Glencore and Gunvor looked at the assets, Reuters reported last year.

The South Africa government's desire to keep the refinery operating has nevertheless proven to be a major stumbling point for buyers who would prefer to convert the site into a more profitable storage terminal, sources said.

Sinopec is in discussions with the government on ways to keep the 110,000 barrels per day refinery in Cape Town running, but talks could still fail, sources said.

The sources declined to be identified because they were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly.

Sinopec declined to comment.

Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall said "the process of soliciting expressions of interest in the 75 percent shareholding is ongoing". Plans to sell the stake in the South African business, including the Cape Town refinery, were first announced in January 2016.

Besides the refinery, Chevron has interests in a lubricants plant in Durban on the east coast, storage tanks and a network of Caltex service stations, making it one of South Africa's top five petroleum brands.

Financial advisor Rothschild & Co is helping Chevron on the sale of the assets.

The remaining 25 percent interest is held by a consortium of Black Economic Empowerment shareholders and an employee trust.

EXCLUSIVE-Venezuela's cash-strapped PDVSA offers Rosneft oil stake -sources - Reuters News

{{20170316T200515.459+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Venezuela's cash-strapped PDVSA offers Rosneft oil stake -sources(Adds analyst estimate Petropiar value)

By Alexandra Ulmer and Marianna Parraga

CARACAS/HOUSTON, March 16 (Reuters) - Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA has offered Russian counterpart Rosneft a stake in a joint venture in the country's Orinoco Belt extra-heavy crude area, five industry sources said, in a sign of the Latin American nation's dire economic situation and Moscow's growing muscle there.

Rosneft , Russia's top oil producer, has been offered a 10 percent stake in the Petropiar joint venture.

PDVSA [PDVSA.UL], as Petróleos de Venezuela SA is known, has a 70 percent share, and U.S. oil company Chevron Corp holds 30 percent of the venture, which includes an oil field and a 210,000 barrel-per-day oil upgrader.

Two sources said the offer was part of a larger package offered to Rosneft as PDVSA seeks to raise money to pay suppliers and bond holders.

It is unclear if Rosneft will accept the offer. Financial details of the potential transaction were not immediately available.

PDVSA and Venezuela's Oil Ministry did not respond to requests for comments. Chevron and Rosneft declined to comment.

A deal would see California-based Chevron working alongside state-owned Rosneft, which has been affected by U.S. sanctions against Russia.

But Chevron's main concern is that accounting and transparency laws are less strict in Russia than in the United States, a source close to the matter said.

The proposal highlights Venezuela's need for cash after the nation's oil output fell about 10 percent last year, according to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. This has worsened a recession that has millions of Venezuelans skipping meals amid food shortages and spiraling inflation.

The opposition-controlled National Assembly says President Nicolas Maduro's unpopular government is resorting to surreptitiously selling strategic assets to weather the unprecedented crisis.

"Any deal of national interest must be approved by the National Assembly," tweeted lawmaker Jose Guerra, head of congress' finance commission, in reaction to Reuters' article. "If PDVSA sells 10 (percent) of Petropiar to Rosneft, that sale is null and void."

MOSCOW'S MUSCLE

Rosneft has already been gaining ground in Venezuela, an OPEC member.

Last year, the company paid $500 million to increase its stake in the Petromonagas joint venture from 16.7 percent to 40 percent, the maximum foreign partners are allowed to have under oil sector regulations created under late leader Hugo Chavez.

"The ballpark value of the two projects (Petromonagas and Petropiar) probably isn't that different," said Francisco Monaldi, fellow in Latin American energy policy at the Baker Institute in Houston.

The Petromonagas sale also raised the ire of the National Assembly, which said the purchase was illegal because Congress did not approve it. Critics have also said the stake was sold too cheaply.

In another controversial move, PDVSA last year used 49.9 percent of its shares in coveted U.S. subsidiary Citgo as collateral for loan financing from Rosneft.

PDVSA said this month it had received $1.985 billion from an unnamed client in return for future oil shipments, with Citgo shares used as a guarantee.

In total, Rosneft has lent PDVSA between $4 billion and $5 billion, but the details of those deals have not been disclosed.

"We must thank life that Russia and the world have a Vladimir Putin," Maduro said at a deal-signing event with Rosneft head Igor Sechin last year.

"I wanted to be here at this event because of how important relations with the new Russia are."

UPDATE 1-Unpaid wages, sackings stir new tension in Nigeria's oil hub - 路透新闻

{{20170316T175519.853+0000}}UPDATE 1-Unpaid wages, sackings stir new tension in Nigeria's oil hub* Niger Delta region mired in poverty, conflict

* Government is trying to broker a peace deal with militants

* Sackings of oil workers, delayed wages threaten stability

* Oil majors blame late payments from state

(Adds Eni comments)

By Tife Owolabi and Libby George

PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria/LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - The moment a group of Nigerian contractors met executives from Italian oil major Eni to discuss unpaid wages they started shouting, calling them fraudsters and liars until a police commander restored calm.

Wenenda Mpi, local manager of Eni unit Agip, blamed the payment delays on debts owed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), a view shared by an Eni spokesman in Rome, and said the government had promised to sort the problem out.

The heated meeting, called after hundreds of Eni contractors threatened a protest that police feared could turn violent, highlights the challenge of stabilising the Niger Delta oil region, even though attacks on oil facilities have halted.

Militants were persuaded to stop the attacks by promises of more investment and jobs from visiting officials including Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, a technocrat who stood in for President Muhammadu Buhari this year while he had seven weeks of medical treatment in London.

That has helped restore output to close to its former level 2.2 million barrels a day (bpd) from the 1.15 million bpd it hit last year. But it is unclear how long the calm will last.

Protests like that against Eni in the region's biggest city Port Harcourt are common, partly because low global oil prices mean oil firms are firing hundreds of workers and cutting back on contractors such as welders, security guards and cooks.

The Eni contractors showed up on time at the city's police headquarters for the meeting brokered by a local police commander, and tempers were high by the time three Agip managers and the police boss arrived more than an hour later.

"We are giving Agip a two week ultimatum to pay all outstanding debt," said Clement Adaminegbe, head of contractors at Agip, threatening unspecified further action. "In case of failure we will take a clear stand."

Mpi promised to look into the grievances but was shouted down by the workers until the Commissioner of Police Zaki Ahmed stepped in - persuading them to meet again next week in the presence of an Italian manager.

"I want both parties to resolve the issue amicably," he said, addressing the stone-faced protesters at the meeting attended by a Reuters reporter.

EXPECTATIONS

Since the start of the year, Vice President Osinbajo has been going back and forth to the swamp lands, promising to drag the region's population out of poverty with a bigger share of Nigeria's huge oil wealth.

Residents say Osinbajo, a Christian like most in the southern region, has connected much better with them than Buhari, a Muslim from the north, who last year sent the army to hunt down militants and has only visited the region once.

Osinbajo has proposed legalising illegal oil refineries to ensure employment for angry youths who often join militants, although a military campaign to hunt them down has continued.

The future of the fragile peace will depend on whether the government follows up on such proposals at a time when Africa's biggest economy is hit by its first recession in 25 years.

State oil firm NNPC has been planning for two years to pay back funds owed to oil majors for joint oil operations. The government said in December a remaining $5.1 billion would be paid back in five years, a time scale which means tensions over payments on the ground will likely continue.

An Eni spokesman said payment delays from NNPC had been accumulating for 15 years, but they expected repayments to resume this year.

Locals are demanding that oil majors relocate their headquarters to the region – a move that most are loath to make due to security concerns.

A spokesman for Eni said 90 percent of its Nigerian subsidiary's workforce were already based in the Delta. A spokesperson for Shell's Nigeria unit said they had no such plans, Chevron and Exxon declined to comment on any relocation.

CASH

The oil swamps are home to 40 ethnic groups competing for a share of oil money, a major obstacle to reaching an agreement that would put a permanent end to attacks on oil facilities.

"There's a kind of cycle of violence in the Delta," said Anthony Goldman of Nigeria-focused Promedia Consulting. "It's not just about paying people off. This money is there – it's in the budget. It's really about what the situation is on the ground."

Villages fight for contracts, forcing oil firms to recruit only their youth as guards or risk pipelines being blown up by rejected hires. Or they demand firms to buy food or cement from them and block passage of vehicles if they bring in supplies from other villages, oil workers say.

"The issue of surveillance contracts is not working well, we will revisit it," the Agip manager said at the meeting, referring to security contracts with host communities.

The protesters handed the Agip delegation a list of 16 demands including a cash payment of 10 million naira ($32,000) to "demobilise" the planned protest. They also want to get 60 percent of future work tendered by Agip. Eni said its contracts were awarded on a competitive basis.

Officials have repeatedly visited the biggest Delta group of Ijaw from which the Niger Delta Avengers, the biggest militant group, recruits. That has not gone down well with other groups.

"If the people of the upland part of the region are not treated with same level of respect as those in the creeks, there will never be security for the oil assets you so much cherish," the militant group Niger Delta Greenland Justice Mandate said in a statement last week.

Locals hope Buhari will allow Osinbajo to continue his peace efforts in the Niger Delta after he resumed work on Monday following his medical leave.

"Osinbajo ... was working hard to return peace," said Austin Ozobo, a Delta activist. "Our fear is that things may get worse with the return of President Buhari, certain steps or modalities taken by the (former) acting President Osinbajo to restore peace in the region may be abandoned."

EXCLUSIVE-Venezuela's cash-strapped PDVSA offers Rosneft oil stake -sources - Reuters News

{{20170316T163517.978+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Venezuela's cash-strapped PDVSA offers Rosneft oil stake -sourcesBy Alexandra Ulmer and Marianna Parraga

CARACAS/HOUSTON, March 16 (Reuters) - Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA has offered Russian counterpart Rosneft a stake in a joint venture in the country's Orinoco Belt extra-heavy crude area, five industry sources said, in a sign of the Latin American nation's dire economic situation and Moscow's growing muscle there.

Rosneft , Russia's top oil producer, has been offered a 10 percent stake in the Petropiar joint venture. PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] has a 70 percent share, and U.S. oil company Chevron Corp holds 30 percent of the venture, which includes an oil field and a 210,000 barrel-per-day oil upgrader.

Two sources said the offer was part of a larger package put to Rosneft as PDVSA seeks to raise money for major debts with providers and bond payments.

It is unclear if Rosneft will accept the offer. Financial details of the potential transaction were not immediately available.

PDVSA and Venezuela's Oil Ministry did not respond to requests for comments. Chevron and Rosneft declined to comment.

A deal would have California-based Chevron working alongside state-owned Rosneft, which has been affected by U.S. sanctions against Russia. But Chevron's main concern is that accounting and transparency laws are less strict in Russia than in the United States, a source close to the matter said.

The proposal highlights Venezuela's need for cash after the nation's oil output fell about 10 percent last year, according to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. This has worsened a recession that has millions of Venezuelans skipping meals.

MOSCOW'S MUSCLE

Rosneft has already been gaining ground in Venezuela, an OPEC member.

Last year, the company paid $500 million to increase its stake in the Petromonagas joint venture from 16.7 percent to 40 percent, the maximum foreign partners are allowed to have under oil sector regulations created under late leader Hugo Chavez.

That raised the ire of the opposition-led National Assembly, which said the purchase was illegal because Congress did not approve it. Critics have also said the stake was sold too cheaply.

In another controversial move, PDVSA last year used 49.9 percent of its shares in coveted U.S. subsidiary Citgo as collateral for loan financing from Rosneft. PDVSA said this month it had received $1.985 billion from an unnamed client in return for future oil shipments, with Citgo shares used as a guarantee.

In total, Rosneft has lent PDVSA between $4 billion and $5 billion, but the details of those deals have not been disclosed.

"We must thank life that Russia and the world have a Vladimir Putin," Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said at a deal-signing event with Rosneft head Igor Sechin last year.

"I wanted to be here at this event because of how important relations with the new Russia are."

Unpaid wages, sackings stir new tension in Nigeria's oil hub - 路透新闻

* Government is trying to broker a peace deal with militants

* Sackings of oil workers, delayed wages threaten stability

* Oil majors blame late payments from state

By Tife Owolabi and Libby George

PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria/LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - The moment a group of Nigerian contractors met executives from Italian oil major ENI to discuss unpaid wages they started shouting, calling them fraudsters and liars until a police commander restored calm.

Wenenda Mpi, local manager of ENI unit Agip, blamed the payment delays on debts owed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and said the government had promised to sort the problem out.

The heated meeting, called after hundreds of ENI contractors threatened a protest that police feared could turn violent, highlights the challenge of stabilising the Niger Delta oil region, even though attacks on oil facilities have halted.

Militants were persuaded to stop the attacks by promises of more investment and jobs from visiting officials including Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, a technocrat who stood in for President Muhammadu Buhari this year while he had seven weeks of medical treatment in London.

That has helped restore output to close to its former level 2.2 million barrels a day (bpd) from the 1.15 million bpd it hit last year. But it is unclear how long the calm will last.

Protests like that against ENI in the region's biggest city Port Harcourt are common, partly because low global oil prices mean oil firms are firing hundreds of workers and cutting back on contractors such as welders, security guards and cooks.

The ENI contractors showed up on time at the city's police headquarters for the meeting brokered by a local police commander, and tempers were high by the time three AGIP managers and the police boss arrived more than an hour later.

"We are giving Agip a two week ultimatum to pay all outstanding debt," said Clement Adaminegbe, head of contractors at Agip, threatening unspecified further action. "In case of failure we will take a clear stand."

Mpi promised to look into the grievances but was shouted down by the workers until the Commissioner of Police Zaki Ahmed stepped in -- persuading them to meet again next week in the presence of an Italian manager.

"I want both parties to resolve the issue amicably," he said, addressing the stone-faced protesters at the meeting attended by a Reuters reporter.

EXPECTATIONS

Since the start of the year, vice president Osinbajo has been going back and forth to the swamps land, promising to drag the region's population out of poverty with a bigger share of Nigeria's huge oil wealth.

Residents say Osinbajo, a Christian like most in the southern region, has connected much better with them than Buhari, a Muslim from the north, who last year sent the army to hunt down militants and has only visited the region once.

Osinbajo has proposed legalising illegal oil refineries to ensure employment for angry youths who often join militants, although a military campaign to hunt them down has continued.

The future of the fragile peace will depend on whether the government follows up on such proposals at a time when Africa's biggest economy is hit by its first recession in 25 years.

State oil firm NNPC has been planning for two years to pay back funds owed to oil majors for joint oil operations. The government said in December a remaining $5.1 billion would be paid back in five years, a time scale which means tensions over payments on the ground will likely continue.

Locals are demanding that oil majors relocate their headquarters to the region – a move that most are loath to make due to security concerns.

A spokesperson for Shell's Nigeria unit said they had no such plans, Chevron and Exxon declined to comment on any relocation and a spokesperson for ENI did not respond immediately to a request to comment.

CASH

The oil swamps are home to 40 ethnic groups competing for a share of oil money, a major obstacle to reaching an agreement that would put a permanent end to attacks on oil facilities.

"There's a kind of cycle of violence in the Delta," said Anthony Goldman of Nigeria-focused Promedia Consulting. "It's not just about paying people off. This money is there – it's in the budget. It's really about what the situation is on the ground."

Villages fight for contracts, forcing oil firms to recruit only their youth as guards or risk pipelines being blown up by rejected hires. Or they demand firms to buy food or cement from them and block passage of vehicles if they bring in supplies from other villages, oil workers say.

"The issue of surveillance contracts is not working well, we will revisit it," the Agip manager said at the meeting, referring to security contracts with host communities.

The protesters handed the Agip delegation a list of 16 demands including a cash payment of 10 million naira ($32,000) to "demobilize" the planned protest. They also want to get 60 percent of future work tendered by Agip.

Officials have repeatedly visited the biggest Delta group of Ijaw from which the Niger Delta Avengers, the biggest militant group, recruits. That has not gone down well with other groups.

Angola LNG launches tenders to sell two cargoes -trade sources - 路透新闻

{{20170316T104418.321+0000}}Angola LNG launches tenders to sell two cargoes -trade sourcesMarch 16 (Reuters) - Angola's liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant has launched tenders to sell two cargoes, trade sources said.

The first cargo, loading on March 16-18, is for April delivery, while the second cargo loading in late April or early May is offered on a free-on-board (FOB) basis - meaning the buyer has to bring their own vessel.

"The FOB tender is only for those that will accept (Angola LNG's) force majeure clause which basically means there is no guarantee that a cargo will be produced," a trader said.

UPDATE 1-Trump seeks input from U.S. energy companies on Paris climate pact - 路透新闻

{{20170315T162808.641+0000}}UPDATE 1-Trump seeks input from U.S. energy companies on Paris climate pact(Adds comment from coal association, paragraphs 10 and 15; quote from Trump's 100-day action plan in paragraph 7)

By Valerie Volcovici and Timothy Gardner

WASHINGTON, March 15 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration has been contacting U.S. energy companies to ask them about their views on the U.N. global climate accord, according to two sources with knowledge of the effort, a sign Trump is reconsidering his 2016 campaign pledge to back out of the deal.

The sources, who asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak publicly on the subject, said many of the companies reached by the administration had said they would prefer the United States remain in the pact, but would also support reducing U.S. commitments in the deal.

The accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015, would limit planetary warming in part by slashing carbon dioxide and other emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. As part of the deal, the United States committed to reducing its emissions by between 26 and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.

The sources did not name the companies contacted.

One of the sources said the companies were "publicly traded fossil fuel companies," and added the White House would consider their input in making a decision on the Paris accord shortly. The source said the White House has been leading the discussions with the fossil fuel companies and the State Department, which represents the United States in climate negotiations, had not taken part.

A White House official declined to comment.

Trump has called climate change a hoax and vowed during his campaign for the White House to "cancel the Paris Climate Agreement" within 100 days, claiming it would be too costly for the U.S. economy.

Since being elected he has been mostly quiet on the issue. In a New York Times interview in November he said he would keep an open mind about the Paris deal. He and members of his family and inner circle also met with climate change advocate and former Vice President Al Gore in December.

Officials for Exxon Mobil , ConocoPhillips , Chevron , Peabody Energy Corp and others did not immediately comment when asked about whether they had been contacted by the White House about the Paris accord.

But several, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, have expressed public support for the pact. The World Coal Association, which represents Peabody and other miners, has also said it supports the deal.

OIL COMPANY SUPPORT

Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Darren Woods recently called the pledges that came out of the Paris agreement an "effective framework" for dealing with emissions, and pointed to Exxon's own work to cut its carbon emissions.

In comments on Exxon's website, Woods wrote: "I believe, and my company believes, that climate risks warrant action and it's going to take all of us – business, governments and consumers – to make meaningful progress."

Rex Tillerson, Exxon's former CEO and now U.S. Secretary of State, also supported remaining a part of the climate change discussion during his confirmation hearing. He said he did not see climate change as an imminent national security threat but said the U.S. would be "better served by being at that table" and remaining a party to climate change negotiations.

Conoco CEO Ryan Lance similarly said he favored the U.S. remaining in the Paris agreement, during CERAWeek comments last week, in part because it could create opportunities for its natural gas operations and its investments in carbon-capture and storage.

Benjamin Sporton, the president of the World Coal Association, had a similar stance: "With a number of well-developed carbon capture and storage projects, the United States is already a global leader in cleaner coal technology. Given the role given to low emissions coal technology in the Paris Agreement by many developing economies, there are clear benefits to remaining within the agreement."

J. Robinson West, former chairman of Magellan Petroleum Corp., and now a managing director at Boston Consulting Group, said President Trump's anti-Paris accord sentiments probably reflected his dealings with the CEOs of smaller companies that operate only in the U.S.

"The independents are anti-climate change ... all this stuff costs them money. The global companies operate all over the world. They have to operate at one standard - the highest standard - wherever they operate," he said.

Global oil companies have spent heavily on environmental initiatives in recent years. Exxon Mobil, for example, logged $4.9 billion in environmental spending in 2016, about 2.24 percent of total revenue, according to its annual report with the Securities and Exchanges Commission. ConocoPhillips spent $627 million, or 2.57 percent of revenue.

Oil major Total starts up production at Congo's Moho Nord site - 路透新闻

{{20170315T071252.652+0000}}Oil major Total starts up production at Congo's Moho Nord sitePARIS, March 15 (Reuters) - French oil major Total has started up production from the Moho Nord site off the coast of the Republic of Congo, with the facility set to have a production capacity of 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.

"Moho Nord is the biggest oil development to date in the Republic of the Congo," Arnaud Breuillac, president of exploration and production at Total, said in a statement on Wednesday.

"Moho Nord will contribute to the reinforcement of the cash flow of the group and to its production growth," he added.

Total has a 53 percent stake in the site. Chevron Overseas (Congo) Ltd has a 31.5 percent stake while Societe Nationale des Petroles du Congo owns a 15 percent stake.

Last month, Total reported some of the biggest profits for 2016 in the oil industry and raised its dividend. [nL5N1FU1JC]

Inpex's Ichthys LNG hit by another contract dispute - 路透新闻

{{20170315T060356.801+0000}}Inpex's Ichthys LNG hit by another contract disputeBy Sonali Paul and Osamu Tsukimori

SYDNEY/TOKYO, March 15 (Reuters) - Inpex's $37 billion Ichthys Australian liquefied natural gas project was hit by another subcontractor dispute, involving the termination of more than 600 workers, but the Japanese company said it was still on schedule for a July-September start.

Members of a consortium building LNG storage tanks at the onshore site of Ichthys near Darwin are in dispute with each other and have stopped work, with one of them abruptly letting go 640 workers, said JKC Australia LNG, which is handling overall construction of the project, on Wednesday.

Inpex said the tanks were 91 percent complete and the project remained on schedule to start shipping LNG to customers in the third quarter.

Still, the disagreement is the latest potential delay in Australia's $200 billion LNG ramp-up, one of the biggest supply increases ever in the gas industry and which will lift Australia over Qatar as top global exporter of the fuel.

The Ichthys dispute is not good news for the project's timely completion, said Saul Kavonic, a Perth-based analyst for global resource consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

"Inpex is targeting a very aggressive construction completion ... to get a first cargo out by the end of September, given the central processing facility, the largest in the world, is still in a Korean ship yard," Kavonic said.

Inpex is not directly involved in the disagreement because it's a matter between subcontractors, so it is not in a position to comment, the Japanese company said.

The disagreement between consortium members Kawasaki Heavy Industries <7012.T> and Laing O'Rourke PLC involves a payment dispute, with JKC saying the latter has released about 245 local hires and 395 other workers that fly in and out.

Ichthys was hit by an earlier contractual dispute in January when an engineering company building a power plant for Ichthys pulled out of the project. [nL4N1FF2PN]

The Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union in a statement said the lay-offs were "due to an ongoing contractual dispute on the project regarding payments."

Kawasaki Heavy has not paid its partner for work on the project for several months, Laing O'Rourke said in a statement.

Kawasaki Heavy could not immediately comment.

Most of the LNG plants being built in Australia, including Chevron's huge Gorgon facility and Royal Dutch Shell's floating Prelude production vessel, are having trouble keeping within budget and on schedule. More delays are expected.

Once completed, Ichthys will produce 8.9 million tonnes of LNG per year.

Inpex holds 62.245 percent of Ichthys and France's Total 30 percent. The rest is spread amongst Taiwan's CPC Corp [CHIP.UL] and Japanese utilities Tokyo Gas <9531.T>, Osaka Gas <9532.T>, Kansai Electric <9503.T>, JERA Corp and Toho Gas <9533.T>.

RPT-CERAWEEK-U.S. shale plots production growth despite OPEC's warning - 路透新闻

{{20170309T120001.781+0000}}RPT-CERAWEEK-U.S. shale plots production growth despite OPEC's warning(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text)

By Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, March 9 (Reuters) - U.S. shale oil producers are plotting ambitious production growth outside the red-hot Permian Basin in Texas, widening a resurgence that could confound OPEC's strategy to tighten global supplies.

As shale firms rebound from a two-year price war with OPEC, many are planning to expand production in North Dakota, Oklahoma and other shale regions.

The Permian - America's largest oilfield - has already seen output jump in the past six months.

Hess Corp , Chesapeake Energy Corp , Continental Resources Inc and other firms detailed their growth plans at an energy conference in Houston this week. The projects they outlined would result in a steady supply of American crude exports through the next decade.

Rising U.S. energy clout has frustrated efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to control global oil prices through a production curb announced last fall - its first in eight years.

The rise in U.S. output was enough to boost domestic crude stockpiles last week by 8.2 million barrels, more than quadruple estimates from analysts polled by Reuters.

The unexpected supply surge pushed U.S. oil prices down more than 5 percent on Wednesday to close at $50.49.

The price drop underscored the growing impact of U.S. shale production on global supplies and prices relative to OPEC member nations, which once exercised dominant influence on global markets. Representatives from both sectors acknowledged that power shift at the energy conference in Houston.[nL2N1GG1DU]

"We are on something of an equal basis today with OPEC," said Harold Hamm, founder and chief executive of Continental Resources, which has invested heavily in Oklahoma shale projects in the past year.

In North Dakota's Bakken shale fields, where Continental is the largest leaseholder, the company has hired oilfield service contractors to frack wells that it had mothballed during the price downturn.

Chesapeake - which has one of the largest acreage positions of any U.S. producer, with holdings in Pennsylvania and Louisiana - has only drilled an average of 25 percent of its land, giving it years of inventory to drill and frack.

"We have this great opportunity to run with," said Frank Patterson, Chesapeake's head of exploration and production. "We can develop what we have and grow."

Hess, one of the largest Bakken producers, is adding four rigs this year and says it has more than a decade of drilling locations at current oil prices.

"We're back to growth in the Bakken," Chief Executive John Hess said in an interview.

These and other expansion plans come as the Permian Basin saw $28 billion in land acquisitions in 2016, more than triple the prior year. Chevron Corp , which controls 2 million Permian acres, expects its output there to jump 20 percent by the end of the decade.[nL1N1FL29Y]

"We're ramping up," Chevron CEO John Watson said.

Yet as the rise in American oil stockpiles shows, producers run the risk of pumping too much and creating a new glut that could push prices down.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration boosted its forecast this week for American oil production for 2017, now expecting output to rise 330,000 barrels per day from last year. Production in the United States is about 5 percent below the all-time high. [nL2N1GK17S]

OPEC WARNS SHALE PRODUCERS

A handful of chief executives at U.S. oil producers met with OPEC ministers last weekend ahead of the CERAWeek conference at a dinner organized by investment bank Lazard Ltd . The meeting, the first between the two groups, was described by attendees as cordial.

"OPEC is trying to figure out U.S. shale," Scott Sheffield, chairman of Pioneer Natural Resource Co , said in an interview. "U.S. shale is trying to understand where (oil) prices will go. We're educating each other."

OPEC plans to meet on May 25 in Austria to decide whether to extend or deepen the supply cuts.

OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo said this week that for the cartel to renew its production output agreement, non-OPEC members must be on board.[nL2N1GK1IM]

Hess, Sheffield and other U.S. shale leaders said they expect the group will renew the production curbs.

"It's really healthy that shale producers understand the importance of OPEC," said Hess. "We're all in the same boat."

While American producers seem unlikely to agree to any broad output curb with OPEC, they are keenly aware of the supply and demand for oil.

"We have the potential to oversupply the market," said Continental's Hamm. "And we have a great responsibility not to do so."

CERAWEEK-Oil majors still years from repairing balance sheets after price war - 路透新闻

{{20170308T165530.950+0000}}CERAWEEK-Oil majors still years from repairing balance sheets after price warBy Ernest Scheyder and Gary McWilliams

HOUSTON, March 8 (Reuters) - Financially strapped oil producers are spending billions to boost production before it's clear that recent crude price gains brought on by OPEC output cuts can be sustained.

Five of the largest publicly traded oil companies - BP , Chevron , Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell , and Total - are trying to work down debts that totaled $297 billion at the end of December. That nearly doubled the companies' 2012 debt levels.

But even with oil prices about 70 percent higher than a year ago, most companies have yet to reach the point where their cash flow covers annual shareholder payouts and expansion projects vital to the industry's long-term survival.

Add other expenses, such as the interest on debt, and the break-even point is pushed out until at least 2020, industry analysts from Citigroup estimated.

"For the entire oil and gas industry, balance sheets have never been worse," said Fadel Gheit, an Oppenheimer & Co oil industry analyst. Producers, he said, "were in critical condition and have been upgraded to guarded."

For a graphic on oil majors' debt, cash flow and capital spending, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2mzgTVc

For now, U.S. producers are taking advantage of the price increase spurred by OPEC's production cuts to boost their output. Some of the oil they are pumping would not have been profitable at $40 a barrel, but is with prices holding steady above $50.

The industry is betting that prices will maintain a delicate balance - high enough to repair balance sheets and finance new projects, but not so high that it creates a new glut.

If crude maintains a price in the mid-$50s per barrel, the biggest oil producers could see their cash flows increase by 71 percent on average over 2016, according to Citigroup.

The danger is that too many wells could come back online too soon, undercutting OPEC's effort to reduce global inventories. That could send prices back to the 12-year lows of early 2016.

U.S. shale producers in March are forecast to pump 79,000 barrels a day (bpd) more than in February, when shale contributed about 4.75 million bpd to U.S. output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency, reversing production declines last year. [nL1N1FE5NT]

Shale output could rise more than 500,000 bpd by the end of the year, said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of analysis firm IHS Markit and an oil historian.

"U.S. shale has demonstrated that it's still a player," Yergin said in an interview. "It's going to continue to be a major factor in the global market."

SPENDING AGAIN

Most majors are planning strong production growth until at least 2021, a Reuters analysis of the latest investor presentation and corporate plans showed.

The firms - Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil, Chevron, BP, Total, Statoil and Eni - plan to grow output by a combined 15 percent in the next five years.[nL5N1GJ31I][nL5N1GJ31I]

It could take another year before the biggest companies' cash from operations exceeds their combined capital spending and dividends, Citigroup estimated. It projects the major oil producers will need to sell their oil for between $55 and $60 per barrel this year just to cover those two big costs.

Chevron Corp, which expects positive cash flow this year, says it could generate an additional $3.5 billion selling its oil at $55 a barrel, a figure predicted to be 2017's average price in a Reuters poll of analysts and economists. [O/POLL]

Exxon Mobil Corp and BP have signaled they will spend more on expansion projects this year than in 2016, a sign of optimism about stronger pricing.[nL1N1FL0M7][nL5N1FS16K]

Higher production could deliver fresh money that can be used to hire workers, reduce debt or boost shareholder payouts.

It would also be a welcome turn for an industry that has been spending more cash than it generates and borrowing to pay dividends that shareholders expect, regardless of the state of the industry.

John Watson, Chevron's chief executive, said in late January he wants to "maintain and grow" the oil giant's dividend, calling it his top priority.

Chevron is winding down construction of several big projects, helping to stem its past spending rate and generate more revenue as new operations come online.

France's Total SA is raising its dividend by 1.6 percent this year, the first time in three years, and says it expects to cover its capital spending and cash dividend with oil above $50 a barrel.[nL5N1FU1JC]

The gains are driven largely by the OPEC output cut in November - the first in eight years. The agreement to reduce supply by about 1.8 million barrels a day runs through June, and OPEC and Russia are expected to review the cut in May.

Some analysts expect the agreement to be extended, but the cartel could just as easily resume higher production, squelching the industry's nascent financial recovery.[nL8N1G737L]

Torgrim Reitan, head of U.S. operations for Statoil - Norway's state-owned firm - said he has "stopped guessing" what OPEC might do in crafting the company's plans.

"We need to be prepared for volatility," he said in an interview at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston. "This is the time for leadership in the oil industry, the time for making the right decisions that will fuel growth."

THE SHALE ADVANTAGE

Unlike the major producers, U.S. shale companies are better equipped to live with volatility. When prices rise, they ramp up drilling and lock in returns with price hedges, which Chevron, Exxon and other large producers typically don't do.

When prices fall, shale producers can more easily cut spending than the majors because of their small size.

Shale producers' ability to pour more of their new cash into production is feeding technology developments that allow them to squeeze more oil out of existing wells and at a faster pace than a few years ago.[nL1N1DU2DQ]

"Those who withstood the storm and survived have learned just how nimble they can be," said Avi Mirman, chief executive of Lilis Energy Inc , a shale oil producer in west Texas.

Similar approaches are belatedly being adopted by the biggest producers. Chevron is embracing a short-cycle approach to investing in projects that can go into production in months, not years.

However, Alastair Syme, who tracks global oil and gas companies for Citigroup, cautions the continued cost reductions by shale producers could thwart OPEC's ability to prop oil prices through production cuts, undercutting the cash flows needed to rebuild.

"If shale producers can grow U.S. supply at between 1 million and 1.5 million barrels a day, it'll be a challenge for everyone to respond to that," he said in an interview.

(Adds IEA report and quote; Changes dateline from previous LONDON)

By Ron Bousso

HOUSTON, March 6 (Reuters) - Oil majors have long been passive watchers of the pump war between OPEC and U.S. shale producers, but not any more.

Majors were unable to grow output for the past decade even as oil prices soared above $100 per barrel due bad capital discipline and huge project delays.

The oil price slump since 2014 has prompted the world's biggest oil firms to drastically cut costs but also to force contractors to make projects more efficient and extract the same amount of barrels for fewer dollars.

As a result, most majors are now planning exceptionally strong production growth until at least 2021, a Reuters analysis of the latest investor presentation and corporate plans showed.

Even as prices hold near $50 per barrel, the firms - Royal Dutch Shell Plc , Exxon Mobil Corp , Chevron Corp , BP Plc , Total SA , Statoil ASA and Eni SpA - plan to grow output by a combined 15 percent in the next five years.

"This environment requires discipline on costs and strong operating performance. It will reward businesses that can remain highly competitive at these prices," BP's chief Bob Dudley said at the London-based company's strategy day last week.

The seven companies will add almost 3 million barrels per day to their combined output in the next five years effectively generating production the size of another major like Chevron.

The International Energy Agency on Monday warned that global oil supply may struggle to match demand after 2020 due to the sharp decline in investment in recent years.[nL5N1GJ3H6]

Fatih Birol, the head of the West's energy watchdog, said that investment in oil needs to rise this year by 20 percent from 2016 in order to meet the rise in demand and natural field decline.

"The first signals from oil companies are not very encouraging in terms of future investments," Birol said in a press conference at a major industry gathering in Houston.

A lot of new barrels will not be necessarily oil as firms like Shell and Eni are pressing ahead with giant gas projects.

But the development still challenges the predominant narrative in the notoriously cyclical oil sector - that the reduction of investment during more than two years of low prices would lead to a supply crunch by the end of this decade.

Many executives including the head of Total Patrick Pouyanne and Eni's Claudio Descalzi as well as the IEA have predicted a crunch by 2020, based on low levels of investments in new projects.

"The investor mindset is switching to growth again," said Anish Kapadia, analyst at investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.

"Oil prices are above $50 a barrel, companies are generating cash and are starting to talk about growth again, we are at that point of the cycle."

THE EXXON-VS-SHELL RACE

The change in mood is expected to be reflected at this week's CERAWeek industry conference in Houston, Texas, as activity in the U.S. shale picks up rapidly and global merger and acquisition activity returns. [nL3N1GH05D] [nL5N1F239Q]

Unlike in the previous decade, when U.S. oil output growth was driven by independent firms, majors such as Exxon plan to be the driving force behind the new cycle. [nL4N1F74E1]

Exxon and Chevron are both betting much of their money on shale production which benefits from relatively low investment and rapid production.

Europe's oil majors on the other hand are focusing more on the traditional large, often offshore projects such in the Gulf of Mexico and Brazil that require big investment and years to develop but also produce larger volumes of oil and gas.

As things stand, Shell could dethrone Exxon as the biggest publicly-traded oil producer by the end of the decade with projected output of 4.23 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2021.

That figure could be revised down because Shell plans to dispose of more than $20 billion of assets in the next two years to pay for its $54 billion acquisition of BG Group.

The Anglo-Dutch group has already outstripped Exxon on profits in the past two quarters. [nL5N1FN1IN]

Jason Kenney, analyst at Santander, sees France's Total as particularly well positioned to benefit from the recovery in oil prices as it is now set to reap the fruit of investments already made. [nL5N1FU1JC]

"The company (Total) is benefiting from a period of 'already invested-in' growth delivery when others are debating about reinvestment for long term growth," he said.

Total leads the group of oil majors with a return on average capital employed, a ratio of profitability versus investments, of 10.2, with Exxon second at 7.3, according to Kenney.

CERAWEEK-Titans of oil world meet in Houston after 2-yr price war - 路透新闻

{{20170306T060001.491+0000}}CERAWEEK-Titans of oil world meet in Houston after 2-yr price war(Repeats Sunday item, no change to text)

By Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, March 5 (Reuters) - The biggest names in the oil world come together this week for the largest industry gathering since the end of a two-year price war that pitted Middle East exporters against the firms that drove the shale energy revolution in the United States.

When OPEC in November joined with several non-OPEC producers to agree to a historic cut in output, the group called time on a fight for market share that drove oil prices to a 12-year low and many shale producers to the wall.

Oil prices are about 70 percent higher than they were the last time oil ministers and the chief executives of Big Oil met in Houston a year ago at CERAWeek, the largest annual industry meet in the Americas.

The ebullience as both sides enjoy higher revenues will be a welcome relief from the gloom of a year ago, near the depths of the price war.

"The oil market has been rebalancing and the powerful forces of supply and demand have been working," said Dan Yergin, vice chairman of conference organizer IHS Markit and a Pulitzer Prize-winning oil historian.

"The mood will be different this year."

OPEC's November deal, the prospects for its continuation and rosier investment prospects for the industry will dominate the discussions, with state-run producers and Big Oil both positioning themselves for an upturn in the notoriously cyclical business.

Twice as many OPEC ministers as a year ago - plus Russia and India's top energy officials - will be in the capital of the U.S. energy industry.

Russian Oil Minister Alexander Novak, who was key to bringing non-OPEC countries on board to cut in tandem with OPEC, will speak on Monday

Chief executives from five hard-hit international oil producers - BP , Chevron Corp , Exxon Mobil Corp , Royal Dutch Shell and Total - will be listening closely to the ministers' comments to see if those production curbs will be extended past their June expiration.

The meeting won't be without simmering tension between U.S. oil producers and OPEC. One of the biggest questions in the oil market is how quickly and how much shale producers will boost output. A sharp rise from the U.S. shale patch could undo the Saudi-led deal to reduce the global oil glut.

Shale activity is humming in the hottest U.S. oilfield, the Permian Basin, a 75,000 square mile expanse in West Texas. The U.S. land drilling rig count is up 55 percent in the past 12 months, and many of them are in the Permian. [nEMNH2K0S4]

"It's exciting now to see the rig count rising and business activity picking up again," said Peter Boylan, chief executive of Cypress Energy Partners LP , an oilfield service provider with operations in Texas and North Dakota.

Exxon, which is expected later this year be eclipsed by Saudi Aramco as the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, recently pledged to boost this year's spending by 16 percent to expand operations, especially in shale production. [nL1N1FL0M7][nL4N1F74E1]

That newfound investment vigor and projections for stronger shale production have kept a lid on the recovery. Oil prices may struggle to breach $60 per barrel, regardless of how much OPEC cuts, if the U.S. keeps increasing production, according to a Reuters poll.[nL5N1GC3R6]

U.S. crude futures closed on Friday at $53.33 per barrel.

BHP Billiton has boosted investment in its shale operations since last fall, forecasting the sector to become the single largest generator of cash flow for its petroleum business within five years.

"We expect a balanced oil market in 2017 for the first time in nearly three years," said Steve Pastor, president of BHP's petroleum business.

UPDATE 4-Exxon touts growth potential with eye toward dividend - 路透新闻

{{20170301T233653.993+0000}}UPDATE 4-Exxon touts growth potential with eye toward dividend(Adds links to related content, no changes to headline or text)

By Ernest Scheyder

NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp , the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, sought to reassure anxious investors on Wednesday about its growth potential, highlighting both short- and long-term projects executives said should continue to help fund the 106-year-old dividend.

"Our job is to compete and succeed in any market," new Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said at the company's annual analyst day in New York.

Woods sought to assuage Wall Street concerns that Exxon has lagged Chevron Corp and other peers in its ability to replace the oil and gas reserves it needs for future profitability.

It was a tough task, with analysts critical of the company's ability to sustain growth. Of 25 Wall Street analysts tracking Exxon, only five recommend buying its shares, less than a third of the 17 who advise buying Chevron's shares, according to Thomson Reuters data.

"Darren Woods did an effective job in laying out the story, but he was hamstrung by his predecessor's mistakes and the market's increasingly skeptical sentiment on the stock," Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov said.

Woods, who was meeting analysts for the first time since predecessor Rex Tillerson left in January to become U.S. secretary of state, sought to show Wall Street that the company's investment potential was positive.

Shares of Exxon rose 2 percent on Wednesday in line with the broader market, despite a drop in oil prices .

Exxon touted short-term projects in North Dakota and Texas, while pointing to larger endeavors in Russia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Angola and Canada slated to come online later this year.

Combined, all growth projects should boost the company's production to between 4 million and 4.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2020, Exxon said.

Exxon pumped 4.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2016.

Exxon and other oil majors have been slow to recover from a two-year price war with OPEC members that has eroded profitability. Exxon does not hedge its oil production, so it is particularly sensitive to price swings.

Last year, for the second year in a row, Texas-based Exxon failed to replace 100 percent of its oil and gas reserves with new projects.[nL1N1G723D]

The company repeated its January spending outlook, in which it said it would spend $22 billion this year, up about 16 percent from 2016. [nL1N1FL0M7]

Woods said that spending should increase to about $25 billion by the end of the decade.

"We are confident in our ability to create significant shareholder value over the long-term," he said.

REFINING

Woods, who previously ran Exxon's refining unit, defended the company's integrated business model, which twins oil exploration and production with refining. Refining profits typically rise when oil prices fall, which has helped lift Exxon's results in the past year.

While some investors have pushed oil companies to spin off refining units to boost shareholder returns, Woods said Exxon's profitability would suffer should that occur.

FACTBOX-Dow crosses 21,000 threshold: facts & figures - 路透新闻

{{20170301T224655.901+0000}}FACTBOX-Dow crosses 21,000 threshold: facts & figures(Updates after market close)

By Chuck Mikolajczak

NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - After breaking a streak of 12 straight record-setting sessions, the Dow resumed its upward climb and closed above the 21,000 mark for the first time on Wednesday. [nL3N1GE4VJ]

The venerable index posted its largest daily percentage gain of the year at 1.46 percent, after ending February with its fourth straight month of gains -an advance of nearly 15 percent and its best four-month run since 2012.

Below is a list of facts about the index on its climb to 21,000:

** The Dow first closed above 20,000 on Jan. 25, 2017, when it ended the trading day at 20,068.51. The 24 market sessions between 1,000 point milestone for the index match the shortest such span in its history, from March 29 to May 3, 1999, when it rose from 10,000 to 11,000, also taking 24 trading days.

** The longest stretch between such milestones has been the 3,630 days needed for the index to close above the 2,000 barrier, reached on Jan. 8, 1987.

** Apple has been the best performer on the index since the 20,000 mark, with a gain of 14.7 percent. It is also the top boosts to the price-weighted Dow, contributing 122.65 points.

** Two other stocks contributed more than 100 Dow points each since the 20,000 milestone: Goldman Sachs and Boeing

** Goldman was the biggest contributor in the Dow's march from 19,000 to 20,000, adding about 167 points.

** Intel was the worst performing stock during the most recent 1,000 point run, down almost 5 percent. The stock is the third-biggest drag on the index, subtracting 12.8 points.

** The top two drags on the index during the move to 21,000 are both oil companies - Chevron and Exxon Mobil - which subtracted nearly 23 and 16 points respectively from the Dow.

** If the index closes above 21K it will have taken 24 trading sessions since its first close above 20K, matching the fastest move between thousand-point milestones which happened between March and May 1999 and took the index above 11K

** In contrast to the DJI move from 19K to 20K, which was disproportionately dominated by Goldman Sachs , the move from 20K to 21K had three strong leaders from different industries: Goldman, Apple and Boeing

** The largest pct mover in the DJI since the first close above 20K on Jan 25 is Apple, up more than 13 pct, followed by Cisco up over 12 pct, while Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson both have risen more than 9 pct

** As of early morning trading on Wednesday, five of the 30 Dow components are negative from the close on Jan 25: Intel , Chevron , Exxon Mobil , General Electric and Verizon
