REFILE-Pressured for profit, oil majors bet big on shale technology - Reuters News

{{20171128T141258.795+0000}}REFILE-Pressured for profit, oil majors bet big on shale technology(Refiles to removes extra word 'effort' in sixth paragraph.)

By Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Shale oil engineer Oscar Portillo spends his days drilling as many as five wells at once - without ever setting foot on a rig.

Part of a team working to cut the cost of drilling a new shale well by a third, Portillo works from a Royal Dutch Shell Plc office in suburban Houston, his eyes darting among 13 monitors flashing data on speed, temperature and other metrics as he helps control rigs more than 500 miles (805 km) away in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield.

For the last decade, smaller oil companies have led the way in shale technology, slashing costs by as much as half with breakthroughs such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking that turned the United States into the world's fastest-growing energy exporter.

Now, oil majors that were slow to seize on shale are seeking further efficiencies by adapting technologies for highly automated offshore operations to shale and pursuing advances in digitalization that have reshaped industries from auto manufacturing to retail.

If they are successful, the U.S. oil industry's ability to bring more wells to production at lower cost could amp up future output and company profits. The firms could also frustrate the ongoing effort by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to drain a global oil glut.

"We're bringing science into the art of drilling wells," Portillo said.

The technological push comes amid worries that U.S. shale gains are slowing as investors press for higher financial returns. Many investors want producers to restrain spending and focus on generating higher returns, not volume, prompting some to pull back on drilling.

Production at a majority of publicly traded shale producers rose just 1.3 percent over the first three quarters this year, according to Morgan Stanley .

But many U.S. shale producers vowed during third quarter earnings disclosures to deliver higher returns through technology, with many forecasting aggressive output hikes into 2018. [nL2N1N62KA]

Chevron Corp is using drones equipped with thermal imaging to detect leaks in oil tanks and pipelines across its shale fields, avoiding traditional ground inspections and lengthy shutdowns.

Ryan Lance, chief executive of ConocoPhillips - the largest U.S. independent oil and gas producer - sees ample opportunity to boost both profits and output. Conoco also oversees remote drilling operations in a similar way to Shell.

"The people that don't have shale in their portfolios don't understand it, frankly," Lance said in an interview. "They think it's going to go away quickly because of the high [production] decline rates, or that the resource is not nearly that substantial. They're wrong on both counts."

Shell, in an initiative called "iShale," has marshaled technology from a dozen oilfield suppliers, including devices from subsea specialist TechnipFMC Plc that separate fracking sand from oil and well-control software from Emerson Electric Co , to bring more automation and data analysis to shale operations.

One idea borrowed from deepwater projects is using sensors to automatically adjust well flows and control separators that divvy natural gas, oil and water. Today, these subsea systems are expensive because they are built to operate at the extreme pressures and temperatures found miles under the ocean's surface.

Shell's initiative aims to create cheaper versions for onshore production by incorporating low-cost sensors similar to those in Apple Inc's Watch, eliminating the need for workers to visit thousands of shale drilling rigs to read gauges and manually adjust valves. Shell envisions shale wells that predict when parts are near mechanical failure and schedule repairs automatically.

By next year, the producer wants to begin remote fracking of wells, putting workers in one place to oversee several projects. It also would add solar panels and more powerful batteries to well sites to reduce electricity and diesel costs.

Oil firms currently spend about $5.9 million to drill a new shale well, according to consultancy Rystad Energy. Shell expects to chop that cost to less than $4 million apiece by the end of the decade.

"There is still very little automation," said Amir Gerges, head of Shell's Permian operations. "We haven't scratched the surface."

TECHNOLOGY AND GEOLOGY

Much of the new technology is focused on where rather than how to drill.

"There is no amount of technology that can improve bad geology," said Mark Papa, CEO of shale producer Centennial Resource Development Inc

Anadarko Petroleum , Statoil and others are using DNA sequencing to pinpoint high potential areas, collecting DNA from microbes in oil to search for the same DNA in rock samples. ConocoPhillip's MRI techniques also borrow from medical advances.[nL2N1GQ0XE]

ConocoPhillips next year will start using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to analyze Permian rock samples and find the best drilling locations, a technique the company first developed for its Alaskan offshore operations.

EOG Resources Inc last year began using a detailed analysis of the oil quality of its fields. The analysis, designed by Houston start-up Premier Oilfield Laboratories, helps to speed decisions on fracking locations and avoid less productive sites.

Premier has reduced the time needed to analyze geochemical data to find oil reserves from days or weeks to seconds. Such efficiencies serve two purposes, said Nathan Ganser, Premier's director of geochemical services.

"It's not only removing costs that are superfluous," he said. "It's boosting production."

UPDATE 1-Kazakhstan hopes for Karachaganak gas field deal by year-end - Reuters News

{{20171127T080304.280+0000}}UPDATE 1-Kazakhstan hopes for Karachaganak gas field deal by year-end(Adds context)

ASTANA, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan hopes to settle a dispute with global energy companies developing the Karachaganak gas condensate field in the coming weeks, Energy Minister Kanat Bozumbayev told reporters on Monday.

"I hope that before the end of this year we and the (Karachaganak) shareholders... will invite you to a table where we will sign something," Bozumbayev said, adding that progress had been made in the talks "in Kazakhstan's favour".

Kazakhstan filed a $1.6 billion claim against foreign firms developing the Karachaganak gas condensate field in 2015, one of the companies has said.

The Energy Ministry has said the row was over how each party's share in the field's output was calculated.

In September, Bozumbayev told Reuters the former Soviet republic had received an offer from the consortium, but considered it insufficient. [nL8N1LP3GS]

Eni and Shell each own 29.25 percent of the Karachaganak project in northwest Kazakhstan, which they jointly operate.

Kazakhstan's KazMunayGaz owns 10 percent, Chevron Corp has 18 percent and Lukoil owns 13.5 percent.

REFILE-Pressured for profit, oil majors bet big on shale technology - Reuters News

{{20171128T141258.795+0000}}REFILE-Pressured for profit, oil majors bet big on shale technology(Refiles to removes extra word 'effort' in sixth paragraph.)

By Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Shale oil engineer Oscar Portillo spends his days drilling as many as five wells at once - without ever setting foot on a rig.

Part of a team working to cut the cost of drilling a new shale well by a third, Portillo works from a Royal Dutch Shell Plc office in suburban Houston, his eyes darting among 13 monitors flashing data on speed, temperature and other metrics as he helps control rigs more than 500 miles (805 km) away in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oilfield.

For the last decade, smaller oil companies have led the way in shale technology, slashing costs by as much as half with breakthroughs such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking that turned the United States into the world's fastest-growing energy exporter.

(For a graphic detailing the decline in drilling costs, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2zCXvxE)

Now, oil majors that were slow to seize on shale are seeking further efficiencies by adapting technologies for highly automated offshore operations to shale and pursuing advances in digitalization that have reshaped industries from auto manufacturing to retail.

If they are successful, the U.S. oil industry's ability to bring more wells to production at lower cost could amp up future output and company profits. The firms could also frustrate the ongoing effort by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to drain a global oil glut.

"We're bringing science into the art of drilling wells," Portillo said.

The technological push comes amid worries that U.S. shale gains are slowing as investors press for higher financial returns. Many investors want producers to restrain spending and focus on generating higher returns, not volume, prompting some to pull back on drilling.

Production at a majority of publicly traded shale producers rose just 1.3 percent over the first three quarters this year, according to Morgan Stanley .

But many U.S. shale producers vowed during third quarter earnings disclosures to deliver higher returns through technology, with many forecasting aggressive output hikes into 2018. [nL2N1N62KA]

Chevron Corp is using drones equipped with thermal imaging to detect leaks in oil tanks and pipelines across its shale fields, avoiding traditional ground inspections and lengthy shutdowns.

Ryan Lance, chief executive of ConocoPhillips - the largest U.S. independent oil and gas producer - sees ample opportunity to boost both profits and output. Conoco also oversees remote drilling operations in a similar way to Shell.

"The people that don't have shale in their portfolios don't understand it, frankly," Lance said in an interview. "They think it's going to go away quickly because of the high [production] decline rates, or that the resource is not nearly that substantial. They're wrong on both counts."

Shell, in an initiative called "iShale," has marshaled technology from a dozen oilfield suppliers, including devices from subsea specialist TechnipFMC Plc that separate fracking sand from oil and well-control software from Emerson Electric Co , to bring more automation and data analysis to shale operations.

One idea borrowed from deepwater projects is using sensors to automatically adjust well flows and control separators that divvy natural gas, oil and water. Today, these subsea systems are expensive because they are built to operate at the extreme pressures and temperatures found miles under the ocean's surface.

Shell's initiative aims to create cheaper versions for onshore production by incorporating low-cost sensors similar to those in Apple Inc's Watch, eliminating the need for workers to visit thousands of shale drilling rigs to read gauges and manually adjust valves. Shell envisions shale wells that predict when parts are near mechanical failure and schedule repairs automatically.

By next year, the producer wants to begin remote fracking of wells, putting workers in one place to oversee several projects. It also would add solar panels and more powerful batteries to well sites to reduce electricity and diesel costs.

Oil firms currently spend about $5.9 million to drill a new shale well, according to consultancy Rystad Energy. Shell expects to chop that cost to less than $4 million apiece by the end of the decade.

"There is still very little automation," said Amir Gerges, head of Shell's Permian operations. "We haven't scratched the surface."

TECHNOLOGY AND GEOLOGY

Much of the new technology is focused on where rather than how to drill.

"There is no amount of technology that can improve bad geology," said Mark Papa, CEO of shale producer Centennial Resource Development Inc

Anadarko Petroleum , Statoil and others are using DNA sequencing to pinpoint high potential areas, collecting DNA from microbes in oil to search for the same DNA in rock samples. ConocoPhillip's MRI techniques also borrow from medical advances.[nL2N1GQ0XE]

ConocoPhillips next year will start using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to analyze Permian rock samples and find the best drilling locations, a technique the company first developed for its Alaskan offshore operations.

EOG Resources Inc last year began using a detailed analysis of the oil quality of its fields. The analysis, designed by Houston start-up Premier Oilfield Laboratories, helps to speed decisions on fracking locations and avoid less productive sites.

Premier has reduced the time needed to analyze geochemical data to find oil reserves from days or weeks to seconds. Such efficiencies serve two purposes, said Nathan Ganser, Premier's director of geochemical services.

"It's not only removing costs that are superfluous," he said. "It's boosting production."

UPDATE 1-Kazakhstan hopes for Karachaganak gas field deal by year-end - Reuters News

{{20171127T080304.280+0000}}UPDATE 1-Kazakhstan hopes for Karachaganak gas field deal by year-end(Adds context)

ASTANA, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan hopes to settle a dispute with global energy companies developing the Karachaganak gas condensate field in the coming weeks, Energy Minister Kanat Bozumbayev told reporters on Monday.

"I hope that before the end of this year we and the (Karachaganak) shareholders... will invite you to a table where we will sign something," Bozumbayev said, adding that progress had been made in the talks "in Kazakhstan's favour".

Kazakhstan filed a $1.6 billion claim against foreign firms developing the Karachaganak gas condensate field in 2015, one of the companies has said.

The Energy Ministry has said the row was over how each party's share in the field's output was calculated.

In September, Bozumbayev told Reuters the former Soviet republic had received an offer from the consortium, but considered it insufficient. [nL8N1LP3GS]

Eni and Shell each own 29.25 percent of the Karachaganak project in northwest Kazakhstan, which they jointly operate.

Kazakhstan's KazMunayGaz owns 10 percent, Chevron Corp has 18 percent and Lukoil owns 13.5 percent.

* U.S. crude hits $58 for the first time since July 2015

By Sruthi Shankar

Nov 22 (Reuters) - A jump in U.S. crude prices prodded U.S. stock futures higher on Wednesday, with traders' eyes on a slide in Hewlett Packard shares after its chief executive said she would leave, as well as minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting.

Trading volumes were thin ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday and an early close on Friday, but investors will scrutinize the minutes for Fed's thinking on inflation for more clarity on what it might do under a new chair next year.

A final quarter-point rise under Janet Yellen next month is almost fully baked in to short-term interest rates, underlining the Fed's continuing optimism about the economy. But the pace of rises is also slow enough not to scare stock investors who have thrived on a decade of cheap money.

"On this eve of Thanksgiving, the market is attempting to maintain an upward bias with oil prices and the macro news leading the way," Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial, wrote in a note.

"We look for a fairly mixed to positive session."

At 8:28 a.m. ET (1228 GMT), Dow e-minis <1YMc1> were up 40 points, or 0.17 percent, with 22,222 contracts changing hands.

S&P 500 e-minis gained 2.5 points, or 0.1 percent, on 130,840 contracts traded while Nasdaq 100 e-minis rose 9 points, or 0.14 percent, on volume of 27,045 contracts.

All of Wall Street's main indexes closed at record levels on Tuesday after a bounce in technology stocks, by far the best performing sector of the market this year.

One blip in that area was the 6-percent drop in Hewlett Packard Enterprise shares in premarket after Chief Executive Meg Whitman said she would leave in February six years into the job. [nL3N1NR5AB]

HP Inc , comprising the computer and printer business that Whitman carved out of the old Hewlett Packard, was also down 4.7 percent after reporting an unimpressive profit.

U.S. light crude jumped nearly 2 percent on Wednesday, hitting $58 a barrel for the first time since July 2015 as a major pipeline cut Canadian deliveries to the United States, where inventories are already said to be falling. [O/R]

Oil majors Chevron and Exxon both rose half a percent and sector services provider Schlumberger gained 1 percent.

One other big gainer was U.S. tractor maker Deere & Co which rose about 5 percent after reporting upbeat quarterly earnings and issuing a strong profit forecast for the year. [nL3N1NS3MK]

The Fed's Open Market Committee releases minutes of its October policy meeting at 2:00 p.m. ET (1800 GMT).

EXCLUSIVE-Venezuela leans on foreign partners for oil to feed its refineries -sources - Reuters News

{{20171121T155304.600+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-Venezuela leans on foreign partners for oil to feed its refineries -sourcesBy Alexandra Ulmer and Marianna Parraga

CARACAS/HOUSTON, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Venezuela's state-run PDVSA is siphoning oil from its cash-paying joint ventures with foreign firms to feed its domestic refineries, two sources close to the matter told Reuters, at a time when late debt payments have triggered defaults.

PDVSA asked its Petropiar joint venture with Chevron Corp to turn over as much as 45 percent of the oil it planned to export in November with no immediate reimbursement, one of the sources said this month.

PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment. Chevron declined to comment.

The joint ventures export upgraded crude to buyers around the globe and the diversion cuts into the main source of the government's revenue. One likely reason for the shift: to deal with intermittent fuel shortages because of the poor condition of its refineries, which in some cases are working at a third of capacity.

The lack of these exports add to the nation's cash crunch as President Nicolas Maduro tries to restructure some $60 billion in debt to bondholders. Some of Venezuela's oil exports are under oil-for-loan agreements with Russia and China. Investors say the country has defaulted on bonds issued by PDVSA and the government and two ratings agencies declared a selective default. [nL1N1NM2FY] [nL1N1NK0JC]

In addition to the Petropiar joint venture with Chevron, PDVSA has this year taken oil for its domestic refineries from its Petrocedeno project with Total SA and Statoil .

PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment. Its joint venture partners declined to comment.

"PDVSA started requesting some cargoes from Petrocedeno for the Paraguana Refining Center (CRP). Now it is asking Petropiar to relinquish almost half of its crude production," the source said.

From August through October, PDVSA took at least 1 million barrels per month of heavy crude from Petropiar after acquiring Zuata Sweet crude from Petrocedeno earlier this year. It is seeking 2 million barrels, or 45 percent of Petropiar's total production for November, the source added.

The diversions are adding new strains to its ventures' cash flow. Foreign partners in several joint ventures also have been required since last year to pay for imported naphtha used to dilute the Orinoco Belt's oil when upgraders are not operating or working at reduced capacity, further hurting their earnings.

The joint ventures are expected to be compensated for the diverted oil through dividends paid to the partners. However, some foreign oil firms operating in Venezuela have been unable to repatriate such payments to their parent companies.

PDVSA's finances are so weak it is struggling to find the funds to drill wells, maintain oilfields and keep pipelines and ports working. Venezuela's overall crude output declined in October to its lowest since 1989, according to numbers reported by the country to OPEC.

Sanctions imposed by the United States on Venezuela and its state-run company PDVSA have also contributed to weaker exports this year. [nL1N1NN1KN] [nL1N1NQ0RL]

Maduro's government has increasingly turned to ally Russia for the cash and credit it needs to survive as China has not extended any more credit to Venezuela amid delays in oil shipments, according to a Reuters special report published in August. [nL1N1KW27W]

Reduced exports of Petropiar's crude is mainly having an impact on customers in the United States, according to one of the sources and Thomson Reuters trade flows data.

U.S. imports of that venture's Hamaca crude grew from 106,000 bpd in August to 134,000 bpd in October, but only one cargo representing 34,000 bpd has discharged through mid-November, the data show.

PDVSA's U.S. refining unit, Citgo Petroleum, in July started boosting its imports of Venezuelan upgraded crude from the joint ventures as a way of offsetting declining purchases from its parent company, which is struggling to cover oil-for-loan agreements to Russian and Chinese companies amid falling output.

Citgo has struggled to buy crude supplies directly from non-Venezuelan producers because of U.S. sanctions levied this year, according to trade sources. U.S. banks have been avoiding extending even short-term credit to PDVSA and its subsidiaries, which have affected Citgo's oil purchases. Citgo has said it is not facing credit issues. [L2N1LV2CE]

But Citgo's effort to compensate for PDVSA's export problems might not last, one of the sources said, as the growing supply of the joint ventures' crude to Venezuelan refineries is undermining its ability to purchase upgraded oil.

SINGAPORE, Nov 21 (Reuters) - South Korea's GS Caltex Corp plans to shut a crude unit and a gasoline-making secondary unit at its 790,000 barrels-per-day refinery in Yeosu for planned maintenance in February, two industry sources said on Tuesday.

The refiner will shut its No. 1 125,000 bpd crude oil unit and a 53,000 bpd fluid catalytic cracker (FCC) for about a month from early February, one of the sources familiar with the matter said.

A company spokesman said the company could not confirm the maintenance.

GS Caltex Corp is equally owned by GS Energy Corp, a unit of GS Holdings <078930.KS>, and U.S. oil major Chevron Corp .

* Norwegian wealth funds mulls dropping oil and gas holdings

* But demand for oil and gas to last for decades

* Size of oil majors means hard to find alternative investments

By Ron Bousso, Simon Jessop and Susanna Twidale

LONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund's proposal to ditch its oil and gas shares, though hugely symbolic in the battle against climate change, is unlikely to cause a rush to the exit by major investors in the sector in the short term. [nL8N1NM4UW]

The move by the $1 trillion fund, the world's largest, rattled stock markets, exposing what is seen as one of the biggest threats to companies such as Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil and BP as the world shifts towards renewable energy such as wind and solar.

But in the meantime, expectations of growing global demand for oil and gas for decades to come mean reliance on these companies is likely to continue.

And although the Norwegian initiative will encourage those seeking to hasten the move to a low-carbon economy, the degree to which other investors can follow the fund's example, at least in the short term, is less clear.

The European oil and gas index <.SXEP> fell on Friday to its lowest since late September, extending declines following the Norwegian fund's announcement.

For some, it was seen as an opening shot in the decline of the 150-year-old sector in the battle to slow global warming and reduce carbon emissions, reminiscent of the demise of coal.

"The investor exit from oil and gas as a fuel source will be slower than coal, but the emissions reduction maths is clear and so this inevitable transition has started," said Nathan Fabian, director of policy at Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a United Nations-backed group that represents asset managers with holdings of over $60 trillion.

But other investors do not draw the same parallels.

"I do not see this as the start of a broader trend among major investors," said Rohan Murphy, energy analyst at Allianz, which holds shares in several oil majors.

"Coal is a more obvious SRI (sustainable responsible investment) sell compared to oil and gas – coal is dirtier."

"Gas, which is a big part of all the big oil businesses today, is the answer for the medium-term energy transition to gas from coal for power generation," Murphy said.

Petroleum companies see natural gas as a cleaner alternative to coal for power generation in the effort to wean the world off fossil fuels by the end of the century.

"Many wish for a quick and revolutionary role reversal between the oil and gas industry, and the renewable and new electric industry. But undue haste and an overly ideological approach could bring great economic and social damage," Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne said in a speech last month.

Also, demand for oil in transportation and plastics is not expected to decline significantly until 2050, according to many forecasts. [nL1N1ND281]

The Norwegian announcement came as more than 195 nations met in Bonn, Germany, to decide how to comply with climate targets agreed in Paris in 2015 to limit a rise in global temperatures.[nL8N1NL6I4]

SCALE

But beyond our dependence on oil and gas, the size of the world's top oil companies would make mass divestment a huge challenge. The top five publicly traded companies - Exxon, Chevron, Shell, BP and Total - together have a market value of over $1 trillion.

Coal companies, on the other hand, have always been smaller.

For now, there is no viable alternative to oil and gas to meet the world's demand, several investors said.

"My guess is that after the initial market adjustment ... the move may not damage the sector's long-term performance significantly," said Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild Wealth Management.

The Norwegian wealth fund's move, echoing Saudi Arabia's plan to list part of its national oil company, was aimed at making Norway less exposed to volatile oil prices and less reliant on revenue from fossil fuels.

If approved, it would most likely take years for the Norwegian fund to unwind its large investments in the sector and find new homes for the money.

And while there is also growing demand from retail investors to invest in 'responsible' or 'sustainable' funds, oil and gas companies are not commonly excluded and any change here would be gradual.

Dropping oil and gas companies would also mean missing out on a rich source of dividend income, a prized asset at a time of low bond yields.

Three – Shell, Exxon and Gazprom - were among the top-10 dividend payers globally in the third quarter.

In absolute terms, the number of oil and gas companies in leading stock indices varies, with 14 in the STOXX 600 index of leading European companies, or 2.3 percent; and 26 in the S&P 500 <.SPX>, or 5.2 percent.

The size of some of the largest can have a disproportionate impact on returns relative to their index peers. While there are just two companies in Britain's blue-chip FTSE 100 index, for example, they make up 14 percent of the index's value.

While the Norwegian fund has long been a trend-setter for issues around socially responsible investing, particularly in Scandinavia, the reason for this decision is relatively unique.

Its desire to make treasury receipts less dependent on the oil price is not a challenge faced by most pension funds, which make up a large slice of the money invested globally.

Any decision to ditch oil and gas would arguably leave them less diversified, not more, said investors, although charitable endowments may have more flexibility to do so.

Venezuela's crude sales to the U.S. rose in Oct but remained low - Reuters News

{{20171117T203745.863+0000}}Venezuela's crude sales to the U.S. rose in Oct but remained lowHOUSTON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Venezuela's crude exports to the United States recovered in October from the previous month but were still the third lowest in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters trade flows data.

The South American country sent 541,130 barrels per day (bpd) to customers in the United States in October, 11 percent more than September, as a result of greater volumes of diluted crude and upgraded oil from the country's Orinoco Belt region.

But the October number was 10 percent lower than the 601,065 bpd exported in the same month of 2016, according to the data.

Venezuela's overall crude output declined in October to its lowest since 1989, according to numbers reported by the country to OPEC. Sanctions imposed by the United States on Venezuela and its state-run company PDVSA have contributed to weaker exports this year.

The largest recipient of Venezuelan crude in the United States last month was Valero Energy Corp . PDVSA's refining unit, Citgo Petroleum, which recently has struggled to import oil from its parent company because of sanctions and crude availability, was the second largest recipient.

Other importers of Venezuelan oil in the United States, including Phillips 66 and Chevron Corp , received smaller supplies than their contracted volumes and typical purchases. Refiner PBF Energy Inc did not buy any cargo directly from PDVSA.

New York-based derivatives group International Swaps and Derivatives Association on Thursday ruled that Venezuela defaulted on sovereign debt and bonds issued by PDVSA after failing to make timely payments. The association plans to reconvene on Monday to determine the amount owed buyers of credit default swap protection on the debts. [nL1N1NM2FY]

ANALYSIS-Oil giants unlikely to share coal's fate, for now - Reuters News

{{20171117T165239.359+0000}}ANALYSIS-Oil giants unlikely to share coal's fate, for now* Norwegian wealth funds mulls dropping oil and gas holdings

* But demand for oil and gas to last for decades

* Size of oil majors means hard to find alternative investments

By Ron Bousso, Simon Jessop and Susanna Twidale

LONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund's proposal to ditch its oil and gas shares, though hugely symbolic in the battle against climate change, is unlikely to cause a rush to the exit by major investors in the sector in the short term. [nL8N1NM4UW]

The move by the $1 trillion fund, the world's largest, rattled stock markets, exposing what is seen as one of the biggest threats to companies such as Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil and BP as the world shifts towards renewable energy such as wind and solar.

But in the meantime, expectations of growing global demand for oil and gas for decades to come mean reliance on these companies is likely to continue.

And although the Norwegian initiative will encourage those seeking to hasten the move to a low-carbon economy, the degree to which other investors can follow the fund's example, at least in the short term, is less clear.

The European oil and gas index <.SXEP> fell on Friday to its lowest since late September, extending declines following the Norwegian fund's announcement.

For some, it was seen as an opening shot in the decline of the 150-year-old sector in the battle to slow global warming and reduce carbon emissions, reminiscent of the demise of coal.

"The investor exit from oil and gas as a fuel source will be slower than coal, but the emissions reduction maths is clear and so this inevitable transition has started," said Nathan Fabian, director of policy at Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a United Nations-backed group that represents asset managers with holdings of over $60 trillion.

But other investors do not draw the same parallels.

"I do not see this as the start of a broader trend among major investors," said Rohan Murphy, energy analyst at Allianz, which holds shares in several oil majors.

"Coal is a more obvious SRI (sustainable responsible investment) sell compared to oil and gas – coal is dirtier."

"Gas, which is a big part of all the big oil businesses today, is the answer for the medium-term energy transition to gas from coal for power generation," Murphy said.

By Gwladys Fouche

OSLO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Norway's trillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund is proposing to drop oil and gas companies from its benchmark index, which would mean cutting its investments in those companies, the deputy central bank chief supervising the fund told Reuters, sending energy stocks lower.

If adopted by parliament, the fund would over time divest billions of dollars from oil and gas stocks, which now represent 6 percent - or around $37 billion - of the fund's benchmark equity index.

The aim is to make the Norwegian government's wealth less vulnerable to a permanent drop in oil prices, at a time when the fund is increasing its exposure to equities to 70 percent of the fund's value from 60 percent earlier.

Europe's index of oil and gas shares <.SXEP> hit its lowest level since mid-October on the news and was trading down 0.39 percent at 16.41 GMT [nL8N1NM4HN].

The proposal came in a letter sent by the central bank to the finance ministry and signed by its governor, Oeystein Olsen, and the chief executive of the fund, Yngve Slyngstad, Deputy Central Bank Governor Egil Matsen said in an interview.

"Our advice is to simply remove the oil and gas sector, as it is defined in the FTSE reference index, from the fund's reference index," Matsen said.

"That would mean all companies that the FTSE has classified with the sector, should be removed from our reference index."

The fund is the world's largest sovereign wealth fund. It invests Norway's revenues from oil and gas production for future generations in stocks, bonds and real estate abroad.

It is among the largest investors in a wide range of oil companies, holding stakes at the end of 2016 of 2.3 percent in Royal Dutch Shell , 1.7 percent of BP , 0.9 percent of Chevron and 0.8 percent of Exxon Mobil .

"The risk for the oil sector is how many investment funds will downsize their exposure to extractive industries," said Jason Kenney, oil analyst at bank Santander.

The fund also held 1.7 percent of Italy's Eni , 1.6 percent of France's Total and 0.9 percent of Sweden's Lundin Petroleum , among others.

At the end of the third quarter, Royal Dutch Shell was the fund's third-biggest equity investment overall, worth around $5.34 billion and exceeded only by its ownership in Apple and Nestle .

"This news will be scrutinised very closely by funds around the world who are already looking closely at the climate risks in their portfolios and which sectors and companies will fare best in the low-carbon transition," said Stephanie Pfeifer, head of the Institutional Investors Group of Climate Change, which groups 140 investors that work on global warming and represent assets of more than 20 trillion euros.

"Investors will look even more carefully at which companies are aligning their business strategies to the transition to a low-carbon energy system and which ones are not. Investors then have a range of options for managing the risks they perceive," she told Reuters.

Others were less sanguine.

"My guess is that after the initial market adjustment – which would have been difficult to anticipate – the move may not damage the sector's long-term performance significantly," Kevin Gardiner, global investment strategist at Rothschild Wealth Management, told Reuters.

BP and Shell declined to comment.

PROTECTING NORWAY'S WEALTH

The aim of the proposal is to make Norway's wealth less vulnerable to a permanent drop in oil prices, especially at a time when the fund is increasing the proportion of its portfolio it invests in equities to 70 percent from 60 percent previously.

"That would mean buying more stocks in the oil and gas sector," said Matsen.

The fund has grown so large that even though the Norwegian state is taking less than 3 percent of the fund's value every year for its fiscal budget in recent years, oil spending now accounts for one in five crowns spent by the state.

In addition to its holdings via the fund, Norway has its own exposure to oil and gas through untapped offshore hydrocarbon reserves, as well as its 67 percent stake in the national oil company, Statoil .

"Oil price exposure of the government's wealth position can be reduced by not having the fund invested in oil and gas stocks," said Matsen.

The fund could still invest in the sector if other parts of the fund's mandate are fulfilled by having some investments in some of the companies, he said.

"But clearly the direction is that ... if the ministry and the politicians think it is good advice and they say yes to it, clearly the investments in the oil and gas sector will decrease over time," he added.

Initial reactions from Norwegian politicians were positive, with two key centrist opposition parties backing the proposal [nO9N1N7006]. Green campaigners also welcomed the news.

"Bravo Norway, and let's hope it gets through because the future of fossil fuel investment is looking shaky indeed," said Rachel Kennerley, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth.

"This is astonishing — as astonishing as the moment when the Rockefellers divested the world's oldest oil fortune," said Bill McKibben, founder of the 350.org campaign group.

"This is the biggest pile of money on the planet, most of it derived from oil — but that hasn't blinded its owners to the realities of the world we now inhabit."

COAL FIRST, OIL AND GAS NEXT

Since 2015, the fund no longer invests in companies that derive more than 30 percent of their revenues or activities from coal - one of an early group of investors to do so, which has made the coal sector less attractive to some investors.

Oil and gas stocks would be replaced by investments in other companies, Matsen said. "The straight answer is that all other sectors would be weighted up in proportion ... (under) our current mandate," he said.

At the end of 2016, the fund's equity investments were split between investments in the financial sector (23.3 percent), industrial companies (14.1 percent), consumer goods (13.7 percent), consumer services (10.3 percent), healthcare (10.2 percent), technology (9,5 percent), oil and gas (6.4 percent), basic materials (5.6 percent), telecoms (3.2 percent) and utilities (3.1 percent).

The proposal has to be reviewed by the Finance Ministry, which in turn needs to decide whether to propose it to parliament. The Finance Ministry said it would conclude with its own view in the autumn of 2018. [nO9N1ML02E]

If it backs the central bank's proposal, Parliament could vote on it in June 2019 at the earliest.

"It's great to have that luxury, isn't it?" Peter Fitzgerald, Aviva Investors head of multi-assets, told Reuters. "You make all your money from one asset class and then you sell your holdings."

UPDATE 1-Seeking to slow climate change, lawsuits look to the constitution - Reuters News

{{20171113T154607.509+0000}}UPDATE 1-Seeking to slow climate change, lawsuits look to the constitution* Greenpeace challenges Norway drilling as unconstitutional

* U.S. youths say climate change a threat to liberty, property

* Courts start to test constitutional claims on climate

(Adds start of Peruvian farmer's appeal in Germany)

By Alister Doyle Environment Correspondent

BONN, Germany, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Climate activists will argue in an Oslo court this week that Norway's plans for Arctic oil exploration are unconstitutional, in an emerging branch of law where plaintiffs are trying to enlist a nation's founding principles to limit warming.

The cases, including one in the United States where a group of young people are arguing that global warming threatens their Fifth Amendment right to life, liberty and property, are widening the scope of environmental litigation.

Some legal scholars say it is a stretch to invoke the Constitution rather than focus on taxes and regulations to control greenhouse gases. Governments including the U.S. Trump administration and Norway are dismissive.

Still, some cases have succeeded, such as a 2015 case that told the Dutch government to cut greenhouse emissions.

And worldwide, 90 national constitutions have some sort of provisions guaranteeing environmental protection. Article 112 of Norway's constitution speaks of safeguarding a healthy environment for future generations.

"We want the court to recognise that climate change is not some side issue but a fundamental core issue," said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace whose lawyers will go to court in Oslo from Tuesday.

"The constitution represents those basic rights," she told Reuters in Bonn, Germany, where almost 200 nations are working on ways to bolster the 2015 Paris climate agreement after President Donald Trump decided in June to pull out.

The Norwegian case, brought by Greenpeace and the Nature and Youth group, argues that a 2015 oil licensing round in the Arctic violates the constitution because Norway has agreed to the Paris accord's goals to end the fossil fuel era this century.

Norway's attorney general argues that the oil licences, awarded to Statoil , Chevron , Lukoil, ConocoPhillips and others, have no link to the Constitution. Norway's environmental laws are among the toughest in the world.

The plaintiffs' case is based on "a distinctly broad, political, and expanded interpretation of the Constitution's article 112," the Attorney General's office said in court documents.

Environmentalists say the case is far more than a stunt. Losing could mean having to pay the state's legal fees, meaning a total bill exceeding $500,000.

Worldwide, there are almost 900 lawsuits related to climate change in 25 nations, a U.N. study said in March.

Among them, a Peruvian farmer launched an appeal in Germany on Monday, arguing that greenhouse gas emissions by energy utility RWE are partly to the blame for melting an Andean glacier that is threatening to cause floods.

A lower court last year rejected his call for compensation.

Cases have risen since the Paris Agreement in 2015. Adding relevance, researchers increasingly say that greenhouse gas emissions have raised the risks of individual extreme events, from heat waves in Europe to downpours in India.

That could herald more claims.

SUPERSTORM SANDY

"Flooding in New York after superstorm Sandy (in 2012) would have been less severe without a rise in sea levels," said Michiel Shaeffer, science director of research group Climate Analytics.

Still, courts are a "blunt instrument" to try to force change on climate policies, said Oonagh Fitzgerald, a legal expert at the Centre for International Governance Innovation in Canada.

"And for a lot of people it seems far-fetched" to link climate change with fundamental rights, she said.

Kiran Oommen, aged 20, is among 21 young plaintiffs in the U.S. case accusing the government of allowing emissions of greenhouse gases to rise even when it knew they could disrupt the climate.

He said that rising seas threatened his uncle and aunt's home in Florida and his brother developed allergies because of high pollen levels in Oregon linked to warmer temperatures.

The court case is due to start on Feb. 5, after judges rejected attempts by both the Obama and Trump U.S. administrations to have it dismissed.

And the Dutch government is appealing against a 2015 court ruling that ordered it to slash emissions by 25 percent from 1990 levels by 2020, more deeply than planned, to care for its citizens.

"The relevant question in all these cases is 'is there an obligation on a state that goes further than what the laws of parliament say?'" said Dennis van Berkel, legal counsel of the Urgenda Foundation which represented 900 co-plaintiffs.

He said legal arguments in the Dutch case were based mainly on the civil code, backed up by the Constitution, which obliges authorities "to keep the country habitable and to protect and improve the environment."

The Norwegian case, brought by Greenpeace and the Nature and Youth group, argues that a 2015 oil licensing round in the Arctic violates the constitution because Norway has agreed to the Paris accord's goals to end the fossil fuel era this century.

Norway's attorney general argues that the oil licences, awarded to Statoil , Chevron , Lukoil, ConocoPhillips and others, have no link to the Constitution. Norway's environmental laws are among the toughest in the world.

The plaintiffs' case is based on "a distinctly broad, political, and expanded interpretation of the Constitution's article 112," the Attorney General's office said in court documents.

Environmentalists say the case is far more than a stunt. Losing could mean having to pay the state's legal fees, meaning a total bill exceeding $500,000.

Worldwide, there are almost 900 lawsuits related to climate change in 25 nations, a U.N. study said in March.

Among them, a Peruvian farmer launched an appeal in Germany on Monday, arguing that greenhouse gas emissions by energy utility RWE are partly to the blame for melting an Andean glacier that is threatening to cause floods.

A lower court last year rejected his call for compensation.

Cases have risen since the Paris Agreement in 2015. Adding relevance, researchers increasingly say that greenhouse gas emissions have raised the risks of individual extreme events, from heat waves in Europe to downpours in India.

That could herald more claims.

SUPERSTORM SANDY

"Flooding in New York after superstorm Sandy (in 2012) would have been less severe without a rise in sea levels," said Michiel Shaeffer, science director of research group Climate Analytics.

Still, courts are a "blunt instrument" to try to force change on climate policies, said Oonagh Fitzgerald, a legal expert at the Centre for International Governance Innovation in Canada.

"And for a lot of people it seems far-fetched" to link climate change with fundamental rights, she said.

Kiran Oommen, aged 20, is among 21 young plaintiffs in the U.S. case accusing the government of allowing emissions of greenhouse gases to rise even when it knew they could disrupt the climate.

He said that rising seas threatened his uncle and aunt's home in Florida and his brother developed allergies because of high pollen levels in Oregon linked to warmer temperatures.

The court case is due to start on Feb. 5, after judges rejected attempts by both the Obama and Trump U.S. administrations to have it dismissed.

And the Dutch government is appealing against a 2015 court ruling that ordered it to slash emissions by 25 percent from 1990 levels by 2020, more deeply than planned, to care for its citizens.

"The relevant question in all these cases is 'is there an obligation on a state that goes further than what the laws of parliament say?'" said Dennis van Berkel, legal counsel of the Urgenda Foundation which represented 900 co-plaintiffs.

He said legal arguments in the Dutch case were based mainly on the civil code, backed up by the Constitution, which obliges authorities "to keep the country habitable and to protect and improve the environment."

Seeking to slow climate change, lawsuits look to the constitution - Reuters News

* U.S. youths say climate change a threat to liberty, property

* Courts start to test constitutional claims on climate

By Alister Doyle Environment Correspondent

BONN, Germany, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Climate activists will argue in an Oslo court this week that Norway's plans for Arctic oil exploration are unconstitutional, in an emerging branch of law where plaintiffs are trying to enlist a nation's founding principles to limit warming.

The cases, including one in the United States where a group of young people are arguing that global warming threatens their Fifth Amendment right to life, liberty and property, are widening the scope of environmental litigation.

Some legal scholars say it is a stretch to invoke the Constitution rather than focus on taxes and regulations to control greenhouse gases. Governments including the U.S. Trump administration and Norway are dismissive.

Still, some cases have succeeded, such as a 2015 case that told the Dutch government to cut greenhouse emissions.

And worldwide, 90 national constitutions have some sort of provisions guaranteeing environmental protection. Article 112 of Norway's constitution speaks of safeguarding a healthy environment for future generations.

"We want the court to recognise that climate change is not some side issue but a fundamental core issue," said Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace whose lawyers will go to court in Oslo from Tuesday.

"The constitution represents those basic rights," she told Reuters in Bonn, Germany, where almost 200 nations are working on ways to bolster the 2015 Paris climate agreement after President Donald Trump decided in June to pull out.

Japan's JERA imports first LNG cargo shipped from Chevron's Wheatstone site - Reuters News

{{20171113T032404.179+0000}}Japan's JERA imports first LNG cargo shipped from Chevron's Wheatstone siteTOKYO, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Japan's JERA Co, the fuel-buying joint venture of Tokyo Electric Power <9501.T> and Chubu Electric Power <9502.T>, said it received the first liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargo shipped from Chevron's Wheatstone project in Australia.

The tanker "Asia Venture," carrying about 70,000 tonnes of LNG, arrived on Sunday at Tokyo Electric Power's Futtsu LNG terminal in Chiba prefecture on Tokyo Bay, said a spokesman for JERA, the world's biggest LNG buyer, on Monday.

Chevron said last month that the Wheatstone LNG project, which started production in early October, shipped its first cargo to JERA. [nL4N1N6447]

JERA has contracts to buy 5.2 million tonnes per year of LNG from the Wheatstone project.

Wheatstone has two units, which at full capacity will supply 8.9 million metric tonnes of LNG a year to customers in Asia. After the second train starts up in 2018, JERA will receive around six LNG cargoes per month from the project, a company official said.

After years of famine, oil dividends back on menu - Reuters News

{{20171109T152224.430+0000}}After years of famine, oil dividends back on menu(Fixes last bullet point to say .. majors' ..not.. major's)

* Pressure on Shell to remove scrip this month

* BP first to revive share buybacks

* Majors seek to show they can make profit in low oil prices

* Oil majors' dividends: http://tmsnrt.rs/2zoJmnF

By Ron Bousso

LONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - The world's top oil and gas companies are under growing pressure to revive share and dividend rewards to investors as profits and oil prices get back on track after a three-year crunch.

BP fired the opening shot last week by surprising the market with the resumption of share buybacks after diluting share value for three years through scrip dividends, where investors can opt to receive dividends in shares or cash.[nL8N1N61IG]

The pressure is now on Royal Dutch Shell to make good on commitments made in 2015, following the decision to acquire BG Group for $54 billion, to remove scrip in 2017 and launch a $25 billion share buyback programme from 2017 to 2020.

"There is a competition to see who can first remove the scrip, resume the buyback and then maybe, how much can you buy back and compensate for years of share dilution," said Jags Walia, asset manager at Dutch pension fund APG, which holds shares in Shell and BP.

"I'd like to see them (Shell) announce the turning off of scrip, start talking about the $25 billion buyback - it has been a while since they spoke about that."

Shell did not provide an update on its plans with its third-quarter results, which showed the company generated sufficient cash to cover dividends for the fifth straight quarter, outdoing its larger rival Exxon Mobil . [nL8N1N81KV]

Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl said in a call last week that Shell's priorities remain to reduce debt, pay dividends and turn off scrip before turning to share repurchases.

Changing the dividend policy will have a significant impact on Shell's balance sheet even with cashflow soaring to $28 billion in the first nine months. Dividend payouts for the Anglo-Dutch company in the 12 months to September amounted to $15 billion, with scrip accounting for around a quarter.

Shell is not the only one at a crossroads.

Norway's Statoil confirmed in October it would revert to full cash dividends from the fourth quarter, after ending a two-year scrip dividend programme.[nL8N1N10QO]

France's Total said it will scrap the discount offered for scrip shares in 2018.

ADJUSTING TO LOWER PRICES

Shares of oil companies went through a roller coaster in recent years, tracking the collapse of oil prices in 2014 from over $100 a barrel to as low as $28 a barrel.

Deep cost savings, job cuts, asset sales and the recovery in oil prices to above $64 a barrel this month have all helped boost profits and shares back to levels similar to 2014.

With the Shell's $30 billion asset disposal programme on track to be completed almost a year ahead of schedule and debt trending towards around 20 percent, removing scrip will be in focus at its investor day at the end of the month.

"The pressure is on Shell to draw a line in the sand and commit to end scrip dividend," said Brendan Warn, analyst at BMO Capital Markets.

Removing scrip, effectively used to preserve cash in hard times, will send the clearest message yet that Shell, as well as other companies, have adapted to a world of lower prices, Warn said.

Dividends are a major burden on oil majors' balance sheets, amounting to more than $47 billion in 2017.

But none, bar Italy's Eni cut levels throughout the three-year downturn. Shell has repeatedly boasted that it hasn't reduced dividends since the Second World War.

Scrip and suspending buybacks were still vital for many companies to survive at crude prices of around $50 a barrel in 2017.

HSBC estimates that BP's operations will fully cover $8 billion of dividend payments as well as $16 billion in spending at $59 a barrel this year, going down to $53 a barrel in 2018 when excluding payments for the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill.

For Shell, scrip has helped reduce the breakeven price in 2017 from $55 a barrel to $50 a barrel, according to HSBC.

Exxon slowed down last year its massive share repurchase programme as earnings dropped. It nevertheless kept with its 35-year-old tradition of raising dividends.

Chevron held off on a dividend raise for the fourth quarter due to market uncertainty, but in July it said such a move would be its first use of cash.

RPT-INSIGHT-Peak oil? Majors aren't buying into the threat from renewables - Reuters News

{{20171108T120002.956+0000}}RPT-INSIGHT-Peak oil? Majors aren't buying into the threat from renewables(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text)

By Ernest Scheyder and Ron Bousso

HOUSTON/LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Two decades ago, BP set out to transcend oil, adopting a sunburst logo to convey its plans to pour $8 billion over a decade into renewable technologies, even promising to power its gas stations with the sun.

That transformation - marketed as "Beyond Petroleum" - led to manufacturing solar panels in Australia, Spain and the United States and erecting wind farms in the United States and the Netherlands.

Today, BP might be more aptly branded "Back to Petroleum" after exiting or scaling back its renewable energy investments. Lower-cost Chinese components upended its solar panel business, which the firm shed in 2011. A year later, BP tried to sell its U.S. wind power business but couldn't get a buyer.

"We made very big bets in the past," BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters in an interview. "A lot of those didn't work. We're not sure yet what will be commercially acceptable."

The costly lesson of the biggest foray yet by an oil major into renewable energy was not lost on rival firms.

Even as governments and environmentalists forecast a peak in oil demand within a generation - and China and India say they may eventually ban gasoline and diesel vehicles - leaders of the world's biggest oil firms are not buying the argument that their traditional business faces any imminent threat.

A Reuters analysis of clean energy investments and forecasts by oil majors, along with exclusive interviews with top oil executives, reveal mostly token investments in alternative energy. Today, renewable power projects get about 3 percent of $100 billion in combined annual spending by the five biggest oil firms, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

BP, Chevron , Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Total are instead milking their drilling and processing assets to finance investor payouts now and bolster balance sheets for the future. They believe they can enter new energy sectors later by acquiring companies or technologies if and when others prove them profitable.

"There is no sign of peak demand right now," said Chevron CEO John Watson, an economist by training, who is retiring in early 2018. "For the next 10 or 20 years, we expect to see oil demand growth."

The International Energy Agency forecasts a 10 percent rise in oil demand through 2040, reflecting the consensus among oil firms. The earliest estimate for peak oil demand from any oil company is late next decade, by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden.

History shows energy transitions - from wood to coal to oil - take a long time. Coal's contribution to world energy consumption peaked recently at 28 percent and remains above the share from natural gas, though just below oil's one-third.

Profit, if any, from the majors' decades-long interest in renewable energy ventures is unclear. None of the largest oil companies disclose earnings from their solar, wind or biofuels ventures.

Investors such as Alasdair McKinnon, portfolio manager at Scottish Investment Trust, believe oil will sustain shareholders far into the future.

"There isn't a viable alternative to fossil fuels on the horizon," he said. "We're not buying into the long-term demand destruction for oil."

The confidence in oil's future relies largely on rising consumption from emerging economies. Exxon forecasts that transportation will require 25 percent more fuel by 2040, propelled by growth in Asia. Chevron's analysis of the India and Nigeria markets, meanwhile, concludes that infrastructure needed for electric cars is unlikely to be built.

Cars account for about a fifth of oil consumption, BP estimates. So if electric vehicles do eventually capture mass markets, oil firms would still expect growing demand from the air, rail and trucking industries.

Natural gas - now a smaller business than oil for most majors - can grow to nearly a quarter of all energy used by displacing coal in power generation and through expanded uses in chemicals, these companies forecast. Natural gas can also fuel the power needed for electric cars.

Although Shell forecasts peak oil demand coming earlier than its rivals, it is preparing for that prospect mostly with massive natural gas investments. The firm last year spent $54 billion acquiring BG Group, which derives half its production from gas. Chevron, Exxon and Shell recently have spent billions of dollars on new liquefied natural gas projects across the globe.

Exxon declined to comment for this article.

SHORT-SIGHTED STRATEGY?

Critics of oil majors' cautious renewable strategy - including some big investors - say the firms are being short-sighted in their trust that change will come slow, or that one fossil fuel will gradually replace another. Just as cheap natural gas is supplanting coal, even cheaper wind or solar eventually will displace gas, they argue.

South Australia is soon to become a proving ground for a project could pave the way for renewable power to supplant fossil fuels for peak electricity - a combined wind farm and grid-scale battery storage facility, by electric-car maker Tesla Inc and operator Windlab Ltd.

Fossil fuel companies need to quickly reorient themselves to the low returns of the solar and wind industries, said Jules Kortenhorst, a former Shell executive who runs the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit energy research organization.

"You cannot flip a switch on a Monday morning from being one to another," he said. "Paychecks in the oil and gas industry are based on fundamentally believing that the world cannot see economic growth without fossil fuels."

To achieve the same share of the renewables market that the largest publicly-traded oil companies now hold in oil and gas would require an investment of about $350 billion over the next 18 years, estimates Wood Mackenzie. Such spending would cut into the generous dividends that oil firms' shareholders have come to expect.

"We think it will be a real challenge for these companies to change their business model," said Nathan Fabian, director of policy at Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a United Nations-backed group.

PRI has guidelines calling for investment analysis that weighs environmental, social and governance issues. Its principles have been adopted by investors with $70 trillion in assets under management.

SMALL SCALE RENEWABLES INVESTMENTS

Oil companies have made relatively modest investments a wide range of renewable technologies. Chevron has a smattering of mostly small wind and solar ventures; Shell invests in sugar-cane ethanol in South America, wind farms in the United States and electric-car charging stations in Europe; and BP still owns the U.S. wind farms it once tried to sell.

John Browne - who as BP's CEO two decades ago helped launch the early investments in renewables - said he still believes the renewable power will grow.

"It will take time," he said in an interview with Reuters last month. "And they have time."

Shell pledged to invest up to $1 billion a year by 2020 in what it calls "new energies."

Total said this year it would spend $500 million annually on developing alternatives. But soon after that announcement, it unveiled its $7.5 billion acquisition of Maersk Oil, part of a plan to pump more crude from Norway's North Sea.

Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne in October explained the focus on economics at an October oil conference in London.

"When you ask our customers what their priority is, either in developed economies or in emerging countries, price comes first," he said. A hasty shift to renewables, he said, "could bring great economic and social damage to our 6 billion customers."

Exxon Mobil is backing research into biofuels, joining with gene modification firm Synthetic Genomics to coax algae to produce more lipids, an oil substitute. It hasn't detailed its investment but said the effort remains far from commercialization. By comparison, Exxon this year spent $5.6 billion on U.S. shale oil assets.

BATTERY-POWERED CARS, PLANES

Some of the oil industry's largest customers are planning a shift to renewable alternatives, especially in transportation, which accounts for about a quarter of annual energy consumption.

Ford Motor Co earlier this fall disclosed it would aim, by 2030, to derive a third of its sales from battery-powered cars and another third from gas-electric hybrids. [nL4N1ME3GX]

A startup backed by Boeing Co and JetBlue Airways Corp recently announced plans for a small hybrid jet by 2022, using batteries from Tesla and battery supplier Panasonic Corp <6752.T>. [nL2N1MG1HZ]

Yet oil firms continue to forecast aggressive growth in liquid fuels. Exxon predicts 90 percent of the transportation industry will rely on petroleum through 2040.

BP projects the world's auto fleet doubling to 1.8 billion vehicles by 2035, with only 75 million of those powered by electricity.

"We'll see if (electric cars) can be delivered in a way that doesn't require large subsidies" from governments, Chevron's Watson told Reuters. "That's what we're seeing now."

Today, renewable power projects get about 3 percent of $100 billion in combined annual spending by the five biggest oil firms, according to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

BP, Chevron , Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch Shell and Total are instead milking their drilling and processing assets to finance investor payouts now and bolster balance sheets for the future. They believe they can enter new energy sectors later by acquiring companies or technologies if and when others prove them profitable.

"There is no sign of peak demand right now," said Chevron CEO John Watson, an economist by training, who is retiring in early 2018. "For the next 10 or 20 years, we expect to see oil demand growth."

The International Energy Agency forecasts a 10 percent rise in oil demand through 2040, reflecting the consensus among oil firms. The earliest estimate for peak oil demand from any oil company is late next decade, by Shell CEO Ben van Beurden.

History shows energy transitions - from wood to coal to oil - take a long time. Coal's contribution to world energy consumption peaked recently at 28 percent and remains above the share from natural gas, though just below oil's one-third.

Profit, if any, from the majors' decades-long interest in renewable energy ventures is unclear. None of the largest oil companies disclose earnings from their solar, wind or biofuels ventures.

Investors such as Alasdair McKinnon, portfolio manager at Scottish Investment Trust, believe oil will sustain shareholders far into the future.

"There isn't a viable alternative to fossil fuels on the horizon," he said. "We're not buying into the long-term demand destruction for oil."

The confidence in oil's future relies largely on rising consumption from emerging economies. Exxon forecasts that transportation will require 25 percent more fuel by 2040, propelled by growth in Asia. Chevron's analysis of the India and Nigeria markets, meanwhile, concludes that infrastructure needed for electric cars is unlikely to be built.

Cars account for about a fifth of oil consumption, BP estimates. So if electric vehicles do eventually capture mass markets, oil firms would still expect growing demand from the air, rail and trucking industries.

Natural gas - now a smaller business than oil for most majors - can grow to nearly a quarter of all energy used by displacing coal in power generation and through expanded uses in chemicals, these companies forecast. Natural gas can also fuel the power needed for electric cars.

Although Shell forecasts peak oil demand coming earlier than its rivals, it is preparing for that prospect mostly with massive natural gas investments. The firm last year spent $54 billion acquiring BG Group, which derives half its production from gas. Chevron, Exxon and Shell recently have spent billions of dollars on new liquefied natural gas projects across the globe.

Exxon declined to comment for this article.

SHORT-SIGHTED STRATEGY?

Critics of oil majors' cautious renewable strategy - including some big investors - say the firms are being short-sighted in their trust that change will come slow, or that one fossil fuel will gradually replace another. Just as cheap natural gas is supplanting coal, even cheaper wind or solar eventually will displace gas, they argue.

South Australia is soon to become a proving ground for a project could pave the way for renewable power to supplant fossil fuels for peak electricity - a combined wind farm and grid-scale battery storage facility, by electric-car maker Tesla Inc and operator Windlab Ltd.

Fossil fuel companies need to quickly reorient themselves to the low returns of the solar and wind industries, said Jules Kortenhorst, a former Shell executive who runs the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit energy research organization.

"You cannot flip a switch on a Monday morning from being one to another," he said. "Paychecks in the oil and gas industry are based on fundamentally believing that the world cannot see economic growth without fossil fuels."

To achieve the same share of the renewables market that the largest publicly-traded oil companies now hold in oil and gas would require an investment of about $350 billion over the next 18 years, estimates consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Such spending would cut into the generous dividends that oil firms' shareholders have come to expect.

"We think it will be a real challenge for these companies to change their business model," said Nathan Fabian, director of policy at Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a United Nations-backed group.

PRI has guidelines calling for investment analysis that weighs environmental, social and governance issues. Its principles have been adopted by investors with $70 trillion in assets under management.

SMALL SCALE RENEWABLES INVESTMENTS

Oil companies have made relatively modest investments a wide range of renewable technologies. Chevron has a smattering of mostly small wind and solar ventures; Shell invests in sugar-cane ethanol in South America, wind farms in the United States and electric-car charging stations in Europe; and BP still owns the U.S. wind farms it once tried to sell.

John Browne - who as BP's CEO two decades ago helped launch the early investments in renewables - said he still believes the renewable power will grow.

"It will take time," he said in an interview with Reuters last month. "And they have time."

Shell pledged to invest up to $1 billion a year by 2020 in what it calls "new energies."

Total said this year it would spend $500 million annually on developing alternatives. But soon after that announcement, it unveiled its $7.5 billion acquisition of Maersk Oil, part of a plan to pump more crude from Norway's North Sea.

Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne in October explained the focus on economics at an October oil conference in London.

"When you ask our customers what their priority is, either in developed economies or in emerging countries, price comes first," he said. A hasty shift to renewables, he said, "could bring great economic and social damage to our 6 billion customers."

Exxon Mobil is backing research into biofuels, joining with gene modification firm Synthetic Genomics to coax algae to produce more lipids, an oil substitute. It hasn't detailed its investment but said the effort remains far from commercialization. By comparison, Exxon this year spent $5.6 billion on U.S. shale oil assets.

BATTERY-POWERED CARS, PLANES

Some of the oil industry's largest customers are planning a shift to renewable alternatives, especially in transportation, which accounts for about a quarter of annual energy consumption.

Ford Motor Co earlier this fall disclosed it would aim, by 2030, to derive a third of its sales from battery-powered cars and another third from gas-electric hybrids. [nL4N1ME3GX]

A startup backed by Boeing Co and JetBlue Airways Corp recently announced plans for a small hybrid jet by 2022, using batteries from Tesla and battery supplier Panasonic Corp <6752.T>. [nL2N1MG1HZ]

Yet oil firms continue to forecast aggressive growth in liquid fuels. Exxon predicts 90 percent of the transportation industry will rely on petroleum through 2040.

BP projects the world's auto fleet doubling to 1.8 billion vehicles by 2035, with only 75 million of those powered by electricity.

"We'll see if (electric cars) can be delivered in a way that doesn't require large subsidies" from governments, Chevron's Watson told Reuters. "That's what we're seeing now."

INSIGHT-Peak oil? Majors aren't buying into the threat from renewables - 路透新闻

{{20171108T060000.000+0000}}INSIGHT-Peak oil? Majors aren't buying into the threat from renewablesHOUSTON/LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters)

By Ernest Scheyder and Ron Bousso

HOUSTON/LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Two decades ago, BP set out to transcend oil, adopting a sunburst logo to convey its plans to pour $8 billion over a decade into renewable technologies, even promising to power its gas stations with the sun.

That transformation - marketed as "Beyond Petroleum" - led to manufacturing solar panels in Australia, Spain and the United States and erecting wind farms in the United States and the Netherlands.

Today, BP might be more aptly branded "Back to Petroleum" after exiting or scaling back its renewable energy investments. Lower-cost Chinese components upended its solar panel business, which the firm shed in 2011. A year later, BP tried to sell its U.S. wind power business but couldn't get a buyer.

"We made very big bets in the past," BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters in an interview. "A lot of those didn't work. We're not sure yet what will be commercially acceptable."

The costly lesson of the biggest foray yet by an oil major into renewable energy was not lost on rival firms.

Even as governments and environmentalists forecast a peak in oil demand within a generation - and China and India say they may eventually ban gasoline and diesel vehicles - leaders of the world's biggest oil firms are not buying the argument that their traditional business faces any imminent threat.

Oil at $70/barrel already a reality for some as Asian premium bites - Reuters News

{{20171107T095917.710+0000}}Oil at $70/barrel already a reality for some as Asian premium bites* Robust demand, limited supplies underpin spot premiums

* Malaysia Miri Light crude touches about $69/bbl

* Australia Barrow Island, Cooper Basin reach close to $70/bbl

By Florence Tan

SINGAPORE, Nov 7 (Reuters) - The rising demand for crude oil that can more easily produce transportation fuels when refined has some Australian and Malaysian producers boasting cargoes valued at close to $70 a barrel, a hefty premium to global benchmarks .

Malaysia's state oil company Petronas [PETR.UL] sold last week a December-loading Miri Light cargo at a premium of about $4.50 a barrel to dated Brent, equivalent to about $69 at the latest prices, according to multiple traders that participate in the Asian regional crude market.

Australian Barrow Island and Cooper Basin crudes are now close to $70 a barrel currently, based on premiums for grades of about $1.50 a barrel to Malaysian benchmark grade Kimanis, said the traders. Kimanis itself is priced at a premium of about $4.40 a barrel to dated Brent, which was assessed at $64.07 a barrel on Monday by price reporting agency S&P Global Platts.

"Prices of domestic Australian grades are even higher than MCO (Malaysian Crude Oil)," an Asian trader said. "That would make them the most expensive crudes in the world."

Demand for these grades is rising because of the short distances to Asian refineries, which prize the crude for their low sulphur content and higher yields of more valuable oil products such as diesel, the traders said.

Demand for short-haul grades has increased after the Brent oil market structure flipped into backwardation, when prompt prices are more than later prices. That means the value of the crude drops over the course of the voyage.

The refiners are willing to pay up for the Australian and Malaysian crudes rather than incur the additional time and cost of shipping Brent supplies from the North Sea, the traders said.

Typically, Asia-Pacific grades are sold to refineries in Southeast Asia and Australia or New Zealand that have a preference for low-sulphur oil.

Values for these grades have risen because of their scarcity.

Petronas and its partners Royal Dutch Shell , ConocoPhillips , Murphy Oil Corp , Pertamina [PERTM.UL] sell about 6 million barrels of Kimanis each month.

But volumes for other Malaysian grades such as Kikeh and Labuan have fallen as output declines at the mature fields.

Australia's crude and condensate production has been below 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) since September 2016, data from the country's Department of the Environment and Energy showed. In August it was 279,000 bpd.

Santos Ltd produces about 30,000 bpd of Cooper Basin crude in southern Australia, according to its website.

Santos and its partners, Chevron Corp and Mobil Australia Resources Co, a unit of Exxon Mobil Corp , produces 5,000 bpd of Barrow Island in western Australia, according to Santos.

{{20171107T083618.316+0000}}UPDATE 1-Thai government expects auctions of Erawan, Bongkot fields in Dec 2017* Thailand to hold auctions for natural gas fields in Dec

* Auction expected to take 7 months with winners announced in mid-2018

(Adds background.)

BANGKOK, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Thailand's government expects to hold an auction for the Erawan and Bongkot natural gas fields in December after two delays, a senior government official said on Tuesday.

The government is currently drafting the terms of the auction and the production sharing agreement, Veerasak Pungrassamee, director-general of the mineral fuels department told reporters, adding that the auction terms should be approved by November and announced in December.

The auction process is expected to take seven months and winners will be announced in the middle of 2018, he said.

Chevron Corp operates the Erawan field while state-owned PTTEP operates the Bongot field under licenses which are set to expire in 2022 and 2023 respectively.

The areas have combined output of 2.2 billion cubic feet a day, about 76 percent of gas output from the Gulf of Thailand.

Thailand's PTT Exploration and Production said in a statement last week that it would participate in "the bidding process of expiring concessions in the Gulf of Thailand, including the Bongkot and Erawan concessions."

Chevron green lights its first Canadian shale development - Reuters News

{{20171106T234955.458+0000}}Chevron green lights its first Canadian shale developmentBy Nia Williams

CALGARY, Alberta, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Chevron Canada, a unit of global oil major Chevron Corp , is forging ahead with its first ever Canadian shale play development, targeting the East Kaybob region of central Alberta's Duvernay formation.

The decision, announced by the company on Monday, is a rare bright spot for Canada's oil industry, which was hard hit by the global crude price downturn. International energy firms sold off nearly $23 billion in assets this year alone. [nL1N1IY25W]

Chevron will initially develop around 55,000 acres in the Duvernay. That could eventually spur more drilling in other parts of the 330,000 acre portion of the shale formation controlled by Chevron Canada, company spokesman Leif Sollid said.

He did not comment on Chevron's expected production or capital spend in the Duvernay, citing corporate disclosure rules, but said it was a major step forward for the company which has spent three years appraising the Kaybob area.

"This is a very significant business opportunity for Chevron Canada and our very first foray into development in the liquids-rich Duvernay," Sollid told Reuters.

"Since we began appraisal drilling we have made significant improvements in costs and cycle times by applying Chevron's learnings in other North American shale plays including the Permian in Texas."

The Duvernay formation is one of Canada's top shale plays and holds the country's largest marketable resources of unconventional light shale oil and condensate, according to the national energy regulator. [nL2N1M71H3]

Canada's energy industry is still dominated by the vast oil sands sector in northern Alberta, but investment is climbing in the Duvernay and Montney shale basins, which offer faster returns and lower capital requirements than the oil sands.

Chevron first acquired leases in the Duvernay around eight years ago and is now one of the region's biggest landholders.

The company also holds undeveloped land in the Liard and Horn River basins in western Canada, a 20 percent stake in Canadian Natural Resource Ltd's Athabasca Oil Sands Project and non-operator interests in a handful of deepwater projects off the east coast of Canada.

As part of Chevron's East Kaybob development Calgary-based Pembina Pipeline Corp will spend C$290 million building infrastructure to ship and process gas and condensate, which is expected to be in service by mid to late 2019.

"We look forward to continuing to develop future Duvernay infrastructure needs over the long-term," said Jaret Sprott, Pembina's vice president of gas services.

** XLE, up 2.2 pct Mon, on track for its best daily pct gain since early Jun, though still down ~7 pct YTD

** This as oil extends gains amid news Saudi Arabia's crown prince is cementing his power, while at the same time U.S. rig count dropped, market tightens [nL3N1NC4QG]

** Meanwhile, XLE - Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund spread ($6.59) held its $4.14 late-Aug low

U.S. shale producers promise both higher output and returns - Reuters News

{{20171103T190227.262+0000}}U.S. shale producers promise both higher output and returnsBy Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, Nov 3 (Reuters) - U.S. shale producers are telling investors impatient for better returns that they can keep boosting oil output aggressively and do so while still making money for shareholders.

Investors have pushed top U.S. shale companies to focus on returns, rather than higher output, a move that threatened to slow the breakneck growth in supply sparked by the shale revolution in the world's top oil consumer.

For the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, slower shale production gains would have been welcome. The cartel this year put caps on its members' production to end a supply glut and boost oil prices, only to find U.S. shale gains and record exports muting the impact of their curbs.

But in comments during recent third-quarter earnings calls, shale executives signaled they expect to deliver both higher returns and output.

At least seven of the largest U.S. shale companies, including Noble Energy Inc and Devon Energy Corp , forecast 10 percent or better production gains this quarter in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield.

Underpinning the effort: Rising global oil demand and crude prices that are up about 30 percent since June lows. Shale producers are also proving they can drive output higher even after several last summer reported some Permian wells had begun delivering more natural gas, a sign of aging fields.

"I'd like to think the industry is changing for the better," said Todd Heltman of wealth manager Neuberger Berman, which invests in shale producers. "Investors are more focused on return metrics."

"We are taking the appropriate steps to become an industry leader with our disciplined approach to capital allocation," said Devon Chief Executive Dave Hager.

U.S. shale output is expected to hit 6.1 million barrels of oil per day (bpd) this month, up 35 percent from a year earlier, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The inventory of drilled-but-uncompleted wells, a backlog for future output, in September reached 7,120, up 42.6 percent from the year-ago period, and an all-time high. While the number of oil drilling rigs in the United States has slid in recent months, each rig's efficiency has jumped sharply in the past year.

EOG Resources Inc boosted third-quarter production by 8 percent and swung to a $100 million profit, from a loss in the same period last year, helped in part by rising oil prices. CEO Bill Thomas said the company is aiming for 20 percent increase in U.S. crude output this year over last. Its stock is up nearly 17 percent since August.[nL2N1N821M]

Noble Energy forecast its fourth-quarter shale production will rise 15 percent to at least 102,000 bpd.

"If you look at the growth from our Permian Basin drilling operations, you can see very substantial increases in oil production growth of about 15 percent," said Tim Dove, CEO of Pioneer Natural Resources Co .

Pioneer, one of the largest Permian oil producers, plans to boost its shale output by at least 16,000 bpd this quarter. The company's shares are up 15.4 percent since early August. [nL2N1N7253]

Next year could bring more of the same gains.

"We are excited about the trajectory of production growth in the upcoming quarters," said Vicki Hollub, CEO of Occidental Petroleum Corp , another top Permian producer. Oxy projects its Texas oil output will rise by more than 80,000 bpd by the end of 2018, to more than 200,000 bpd. [nL2N1N72CF]

Shale producers outside Texas are cranking up production, too.

Whiting Petroleum Corp , which operates in North Dakota's Bakken shale, plans a 10 percent jump in its fourth-quarter production.[nL2N1N02IO]

"We're confident about the areas in which we're drilling through to the end of the year and really, through the end of 2018," said Jim Volker, who retired as Whiting's CEO this week.[nL4N1MZ5UY]

Continental Resources Inc and Parsley Energy Inc , two other large U.S. shale producers, are due to report quarterly results next week.

OPEC TENSION

U.S. shale increases are keenly watched by OPEC, and likely will be in the spotlight when the group and other major producers meet on Nov. 30 in Vienna.

Emmanuel Kachikwu, Nigeria's oil minister, warned at the last OPEC meeting in May that the group would "sit down again and look at what process it is we need to do" if U.S. shale output continues to weigh on global markets.[nL1N1IQ0AC]

Adding to the pressures, major oil companies that were late to recognize shale's potential have brought their own resources to bear. Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp are setting out aggressive plans for U.S. shale production, especially in the Permian.[nL2N1N20S2]

Exxon, which more than doubled its Permian holdings earlier this year, plans to boost the number of drilling rigs there by 50 percent, to 30, by the end of next year. By 2020, Exxon expects its Permian oil production to rise 45 percent.[nL2N1N20K7]

Chevron, which has operated in the Permian since the 1930s, recently added a 15th drilling rig in the Permian, with plans to add five more.[nL2N1N20NT]

"We'll be in a position to grow production for a period of years just from the shale," Chevron CEO John Watson said of the company's Permian operations.

UPDATE 1-Threats to NAFTA cast doubt over Mexico's oil tenders, investment - Reuters News

{{20171103T005603.510+0000}}UPDATE 1-Threats to NAFTA cast doubt over Mexico's oil tenders, investment(Adds comment from oil regulator)

By David Alire Garcia

MEXICO CITY, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Uncertainty about the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and investor protections it guarantees could crimp future investment in Mexico's oil industry, including a high-stakes January deepwater auction.

Ahead of a fifth round of NAFTA talks in Mexico City in mid-November, Washington's tough demands that partners Canada and Mexico resist has clouded the future of the 23-year-old pact President Donald Trump has threatened to quit if he cannot get a better deal. [nL2N1MS0XB]

The January deepwater tender of 29 blocks holding some 4.2 billion barrels of prospective reserves, could suffer if concerns about NAFTA's future persuaded oil majors such as Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp to sit out the auction, oil executives and former government officials say.

So far, 17 companies have begun the process of pre-qualifying for the auction.

"Future investment without those investment protections of NAFTA will take into account the higher level of risk of any dispute not being settled in a more fair manner," Tim Callahan, Mexico country manager for Australia's BHP Billiton , told Reuters.

Energy firms worry the end of NAFTA could eliminate the so-called Investor State Dispute Settlement, which allows such conflicts to be settled via international arbitrators, overriding contractual clauses that only reference local courts.

Last December, BHP Billiton won a 60 percent stake in the $11 billion Trion field in the Gulf of Mexico, the flagship deepwater project of state-owned oil company Pemex.

That same day, eight of 10 blocks were awarded in the deepwater auction, yielding investment commitments worth hundreds of millions of dollars in the first few years of the contracts alone by firms like U.S.-based Chevron and Murphy Oil.

The auctions are part of a 2013 energy reform that ended Pemex's monopoly on oil and gas production. So far, the reform has secured investment pledges that will eventually be worth about $80 billion, the government says.

Callahan, who heads the Mexican oil producer association's NAFTA committee, pointed to longstanding nationalist sentiment toward oil and a lack of legal precedents during the 75-year Pemex monopoly.

"I don't think any of us want to be the first to test in the Mexican courts how they're going to rule on any disputes when it comes to oil," he said.

Threats to NAFTA may force some U.S. oil firms to opt out of January's tenders, said former deputy energy minister Lourdes Melgar, an architect of the auctions. Some deem the investor dispute mechanism "essential" to protect investments, she added.

Some of the biggest investments to date were made only after the government assured firms behind closed doors that any expropriation or administrative withdrawal of contracts could be appealed using the NAFTA resolution mechanism, said Carlos Pascual, a former U.S. ambassador to Mexico now at IHS Markit.

The assurances were made before Trump's surprise election win and company concerns over investor protections lasted "up until the last minute" before bids were submitted, Pascual said.

Without NAFTA, investment disputes could fall to Mexican courts, which unsettles some firms concerned that local judges are often susceptible to bribes or intimidation, oil company executives and former officials say.

"It's a fight for the oil and gas dollar now, and if the companies aren't treated fairly, then there's lots of other places to go," said Craig Steinke, head of Canada-based Renaissance Oil Corp , a company that has won five onshore contracts in Mexico.

Even under the oil contracts' administrative withdrawal clause, companies are entitled to an audience to present their case, the participation of an independent expert and there are no one-person decisions, said Juan Carlos Zepeda, head of oil regulator CNH, which is in charge of supervising the contracts.

Energy Minister Pedro Joaquin Coldwell told Reuters that even without NAFTA protections, respect for due process was embedded in Mexico's legal system. He added that Mexico has more than a dozen other bilateral investment treaties with similar protections as NAFTA, a point that several oil executives who have spoken to Reuters in private also make.

"I don't think the industry should be worried," Coldwell said.

However, leftist presidential hopeful Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has led early polls for next July's election, has a different message.

Lopez Obrador promises to review signed oil contracts and his top energy advisor Rocio Nahle said foreign companies should not bank on bypassing local courts.

"They need to be careful ... and respect Mexico's laws because this is Mexican territory," said Nahle, who also leads Lopez Obrador's party in the lower house of Congress.

Venezuela arrests head of oil firm PDVSA's Bariven unit - sources - Reuters News

{{20171102T143801.414+0000}}Venezuela arrests head of oil firm PDVSA's Bariven unit - sourcesBy Alexandra Ulmer

CARACAS, Nov 2 (Reuters) - The head of Venezuelan oil company PDVSA's subsidiary Bariven was arrested this week, according to two sources and an internal message seen by Reuters, as a graft investigation in the OPEC member swells.

Francisco Jimenez, the head of procurement arm Bariven, was detained on Tuesday afternoon at PDVSA's Caracas headquarters, the internal message read. Another executive, Joaquin Torres, was detained alongside him, according to the message.

PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the arrests. Chief prosecutor Tarek Saab was due to make an announcement on "legal advances in the Bariven case" later on Thursday.

About two dozen high-level executives have been arrested in recent weeks, ridding PDVSA of much of its top brass. Last week, Spanish authorities arrested a former Venezuelan deputy minister and three former executives at state companies for alleged links to money laundering and international corruption. [nL2N1N116U] [nL2N1N3008]

Bariven has been in the spotlight since 2015, after U.S. authorities arrested two prominent Venezuelan oil businessmen on charges of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). Both men have pleaded guilty to bribing PDVSA officials in order to win juicy contracts with Bariven.

Socialist-run Venezuela originally slammed the investigations as sabotage by the U.S government, its ideological foe.

But in a turnaround, PDVSA said in July last year it was actually a victim of fraud and Bariven then asked a U.S. court to order the two businessmen to compensate it for $600 million in losses.

President Nicolas Maduro's government and PDVSA, which is formally known as Petroleos de Venezuela SA, have repeatedly vowed to take steps to combat corruption, which has affected the nation and its oil industry for decades. [nL2N1H61B7]

Opposition leaders say PDVSA has been crippled by malfeasance under 18 years of socialist rule. They say sporadic arrests are the result of infighting among rival government factions.

Sources close to PDVSA say the arrests owe more to turf wars for control of the company, which is the financial motor of Venezuela's ailing economy, than a wholesale effort to clean up graft. [nL1N1KT1ER]

Several oil industry sources have said workers at PDVSA are increasingly nervous about the spreading graft probes.

Thailand's PTTEP incurs $264 mln loss after delaying Canadian oil sands project - Reuters News

{{20171102T113956.216+0000}}Thailand's PTTEP incurs $264 mln loss after delaying Canadian oil sands projectBANGKOK, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Thailand's PTT Exploration and Production Pcl , the upstream arm of energy giant PTT Group , reported on Thursday a third-quarter loss of $264 million, after booking a further $558-million impairment charge on its stalled Mariana Oil Sands project in Canada.

PTTEP said it has delayed its final investment decision on the project "after assessment of the industry and commercial feasibility studies". This is the company's third writedown on the project, amounting to a total of $1.8 billion [nL4N1MV1TC].

The company, which reported a 2 percent rise in third-quarter sales to $1 billion due to higher oil and gas production volumes and prices. Gas sales from its Malaysia-Thai Joint Development areas were higher, while shutdown periods were shorter in its Bongkot fields.

PTTEP has budgeted $4 billion for capital expenditure including mergers and acqusitions, the company said, adding that it would target "producing assets or those which are in the final stage of development" in Southesat Asia and other areas with high potential and low risk. [nL4N1N02IY]

For the rest of 2017 it aims to maintain an oil and gas sales volume in Thailand of around 300,000 boed (barrels of oil equivalent per day) and estimates costs to be running at $29/boe for the rest of the year.
