BREAKINGVIEWS-Oil majors surge into mid-cycle sweet spot - 路透新闻

{{20170428T173426.882+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Oil majors surge into mid-cycle sweet spot(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Lauren Silva Laughlin

DALLAS, April 28 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Exxon Mobil and Chevron look to be in a mid-cycle sweet spot. The two oil majors surged to sharp first-quarter upswings on Friday thanks to higher oil prices and better margins. It's a turnaround from early 2016. Now, though, the risks go both ways. Crude prices have lost some stuffing in recent days and, given supply, could slump again. Or, if prices hold up, costs will start rising.

In the first quarter last year, West Texas Intermediate crude prices dipped below $30 a barrel. Crude prices have since recovered to around $50. Largely as a result, Exxon's profit for the quarter more than doubled to $4 billion. Chevron swung to earnings of $2.7 billion after posting a loss in the first quarter of 2016.

Exxon and Chevron, respectively worth around $350 billion and $200 billion in market capitalization, also sold and bought assets in the quarter. That helped position them as drilling heats up again in the United States. Both companies invested in Permian Basin production: Exxon bought $5.6 billion of assets from the Bass family and Chevron's output increased 33 percent.

The strong performance at Exxon – Chief Executive Darren Woods' first quarter in charge – came even as production declined 4 percent from a year before. Yet the industry is never predictable. On Thursday, the WTI crude price temporarily dropped below its 200-day moving average, sinking below $48.50. While U.S. oil inventories are steady according to the Energy Information Agency, the rig count in the United States has spiked, by Baker Hughes figures. That's a harbinger of rising supply, which could soften prices.

And if oil prices remain where they are or rise, demand for rigs and other oil services will intensify, pushing up the costs of production. Halliburton said on Monday conditions would soon allow it to hike its prices. Sand and transportation companies will charge more too. Chevron finance chief Patricia Yarrington said that the company was working to keep inflationary pressures in check, specifically in the Permian. Even when you're a global oil powerhouse, though, not everything is within your control.

U.S. drillers add oil rigs for 15th week, monthly pace slows -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20170428T171407.803+0000}}U.S. drillers add oil rigs for 15th week, monthly pace slows -Baker HughesApril 28 (Reuters) - U.S. drillers added oil rigs for a 15th
week in a row, but the pace of those additions slowed in April
to the lowest in five months as crude prices fell below $50 a
barrel on doubts OPEC will continue to cut production enough to
reduce the global glut.

Drillers added nine oil rigs in the week to April 28,
bringing the total count up to 697, the most since April 2015,
energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc  said on Friday.

While that is more than double the same week a year ago when
there were only 332 active oil rigs, the pace of additions has
declined in April with 35 rigs deployed, the lowest since
November when 33 rigs were added.

That compares with the addition 60 oil rigs in March, the
most added in a month since December 2011.
   U.S. crude futures  traded above $49 a barrel on Friday
after dropping to a one-month low the previous day, amid doubts
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
production cuts will restore balance to an oversupplied market,
especially as U.S. drillers keep producing more oil. [O/R]

U.S. crude output  last week hit its highest
since August 2015 at 9.3 million barrels per day, according to
government data.[EIA/S]

Despite recent price declines, analysts continued to
project U.S. energy firms would boost spending on drilling and
pump more oil and natural gas from shale fields in coming years
with energy prices expected to climb in future months.

Futures for were fetching about $50 a barrel for the balance
of 2017  and around $51 for calendar 2018 .

Rising crude prices helped Chevron Corp  and Exxon
Mobil Corp  easily beat analysts' quarterly profit
expectations on Friday, setting an upbeat tone as the two
companies press ahead with shale oil expansions. [nL1N1I014E]

Chevron said it will boost its Permian drilling rig count by
67 percent to 20 rigs by end of 2018. [nL1N1I017C]

Halliburton Co , the world's second biggest oilfield

Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S.

and gas rig count would average 847 in 2017, 1,045 in 2018 and
1,178 in 2019. Most wells produce both oil and gas.

WRAPUP 3-Surging Chevron, Exxon profits signal oil industry turnaround - 路透新闻

{{20170428T165501.491+0000}}WRAPUP 3-Surging Chevron, Exxon profits signal oil industry turnaround(Adds Chevron details; updates stock)

By Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, April 28 (Reuters) - Rising crude prices helped Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp easily beat analysts' quarterly profit expectations on Friday, setting an upbeat tone as the two companies press ahead with shale oil expansions.

While cost cuts and asset sales provided a boost to both companies, the results highlighted the slowly improving dynamics for the energy industry as oil prices have climbed more than 50 percent since early 2016.

First-quarter results were especially robust at Exxon, with quarterly profit more than doubling to $4.01 billion, even as production fell 4 percent. [nL1N1I00KT]

Chevron swung to a $2.68 billion quarterly profit and turned cash flow positive, earning more than it spent, a milestone Wall Street analysts had long sought. Cash flow should continue to rise further, Chief Financial Officer Pat Yarrington told investors on a Friday conference call. [nL1N1I00NZ]

Chevron's results were helped by $2.1 billion in asset sales. The company has sold more than $5 billion in assets since last year and is seeking buyers for its Canadian oil sands business, sources have told Reuters. [nL1N1HL0PQ]

If Chevron sells the business, "we'd want to make sure we got full value for it," Yarrington said.

Shares of both Exxon and Chevron rose less than 1 percent in afternoon trading as U.S. oil prices traded flat near $49 per barrel.

Their energy peers, BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc , are set to report quarterly results next week.

Looming over the large international oil companies, though, is uncertainty over whether the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will extend a production cut past June when it meets next month in Vienna. Should the cut not be continued, oil prices would likely drop, pushing the sector back into recession. [nL8N1HZ5SQ]

'NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS'

Jeff Woodbury, Exxon's head of investor relations, said while the company believes underlying global oil demand remains strong, high inventories and new supplies coming into the market "indicates a need to be cautious."

Chevron and Exxon expanded production in their American shale portfolios during the quarter, with both deciding the low-cost fields offered an easy opportunity to boost profit. They have laid out plans to increase drilling in those fields this year. [nL1N1FM1EO]

Chevron, the second largest leaseholder in the Permian Basin, which is the largest American oilfield, has devoted much of its 2017 capital budget to shale projects. Chief Executive Officer John Watson told Reuters earlier this month the Permian was vital to Chevron's growth. [nL2N1GL1L8] [nL2N1HC1IA]

Exxon doubled its acreage holdings in the Permian Basin of West Texas earlier this year in a deal worth up to $6.6 billion. It was the U.S. oil industry's largest deal in the first quarter, and Exxon said it plans to drill its first well on the acreage soon. [nL4N1F74E1]

"We see unique value that we're going to bring to that Permian acreage," Woodbury said on a conference call with investors on Friday.

In Asia, both companies expanded liquefied natural gas operations. Chevron brought a third processing facility online at its Gorgon LNG project in Australia, and Exxon bought InterOil in a $2.5 billion deal to expand in Papua New Guinea.

Chevron still expects the Wheatstone LNG project in Australia to come online by the middle of the year, executives said.

Exxon also bought a 25 percent stake in a Mozambique gas field last month in a deal worth up to $2.8 billion. [nL3N1GM3SO]

First-quarter results were especially robust at Exxon, where quarterly profit more than doubled to $4.01 billion, even as production fell 4 percent.[nL1N1I00KT]

Chevron swung to a $2.68 billion quarterly profit and turned cash flow positive, earning more than it spent, a milestone Wall Street analysts had long sought. [nL1N1I00NZ]

Shares of both companies rose about 1 percent in morning trading.

Their energy peers, BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc , are set to report quarterly results next week.

Looming over the large international oil companies, though, is uncertainty over whether the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will extend a production cut past June when it meets next month in Vienna. Should the cut not be continued, oil prices would likely drop, pushing the sector back into recession. [nL8N1HZ5SQ]

'NEED TO BE CAUTIOUS'

Jeff Woodbury, Exxon's head of investor relations, said that while the company believes underlying global oil demand remains strong, high inventories and new supplies coming into the market "indicates a need to be cautious."

Chevron and Exxon expanded production in their American shale portfolios during the quarter, with both deciding that the low-cost fields offered an easy opportunity to boost profit and laying out plans to increase drilling in those fields this year.[nL1N1FM1EO]

Chevron, the second largest leaseholder in the Permian Basin, which is the largest American oilfield, has devoted much of its 2017 capital budget to shale projects. Chief Executive Officer John Watson told Reuters earlier this month the Permian was vital to Chevron's growth. [nL2N1GL1L8] [nL2N1HC1IA]

Exxon doubled its acreage holdings in the Permian Basin of West Texas earlier this year in a deal worth up to $6.6 billion. It was the U.S. oil industry's largest deal in the first quarter, and Exxon said it plans to drill its first well on the acreage soon. [nL4N1F74E1]

"We see unique value that we're going to bring to that Permian acreage," Woodbury said on a conference call with investors on Friday.

In Asia, both companies expanded liquefied natural gas operations. Chevron brought a third processing facility online at its Gorgon LNG project in Australia, and Exxon bought InterOil in a $2.5 billion deal to expand in Papua New Guinea.

Exxon also bought a 25 percent stake in a Mozambique gas field last month in a deal worth up to $2.8 billion.[nL3N1GM3SO]

HOUSTON, April 28 (Reuters) - Rising crude prices helped Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp easily beat Wall Street's profit expectations on Friday, a sign the oil industry has regained its footing after a two-year price spiral.

UPDATE 1-Chevron profit beats expectations on cost cuts, asset sales - 路透新闻

{{20170428T130037.964+0000}}UPDATE 1-Chevron profit beats expectations on cost cuts, asset sales(Adds earning comparison, quarter details, stock)

By Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, April 28 (Reuters) - Oil producer Chevron Corp posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday due to cost cuts, asset sales and rising crude prices .

Like many of its peers, Chevron has benefited from a jump in oil prices after a two-year price downturn that rocked the industry. The company's breadwinner oil and gas division swung to a profit and earnings jumped in the refining division.

Divestitures, though, also boosted results, with sales in Indonesia and elsewhere producing a one-time gain.

Chevron posted net income of $2.68 billion, or $1.41 per share, compared to a loss of $725 million, or 39 cents per share, in the year-ago period.

Excluding one-time items, Chevron earned $1.23 per share during the quarter.

By that measure, analysts expected earnings of 86 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Production rose 0.4 percent to 2.67 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, partly to increases in the Permian Basin of West Texas.

Chief Executive John Watson told Reuters earlier this month the Permian was vital to Chevron's growth.[nL2N1GL1L8][nL2N1HC1IA]

Shares of California-based Chevron rose 2.2 percent to $107.80 in premarket trading.

Chevron to sell Bangladesh gas fields to Chinese co - 路透新闻

{{20170424T101646.210+0000}}Chevron to sell Bangladesh gas fields to Chinese coNEW DELHI, April 24 (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas company Chevron Corp said on Monday it has agreed to sell its three gas producing fields in Bangladesh to Chinese firm Himalaya Energy, as part of a plan to raise billions of dollars by shedding non-core properties this year.

"The agreement is for the sale of Chevron's Bangladesh companies, which hold our interests in Bangladesh," a company spokesman told Reuters, declining to share the deal value or any timeline.

The spokesman said Himalaya Energy is owned by a consortium of China ZhenHua Oil and CNIC Corp Ltd. ZhenHua is a state-owned oil company while CNIC is an investment corporation established in Hong Kong.

Reuters reported in February that ZhenHua Oil had signed a preliminary deal with Chevron to buy the U.S. oil major's natural gas fields in Bangladesh that are worth about $2 billion. [nL4N1G73C1]

DEALTALK-Canada's oil sands acquisition pool dwindles as global firms flee - 路透新闻

{{20170421T180003.812+0000}}DEALTALK-Canada's oil sands acquisition pool dwindles as global firms flee(For more Reuters DEALTALKS, click on [DEALTALK/])

By Nia Williams and John Tilak

CALGARY, Alberta/TORONTO April 21 (Reuters) - As international energy companies retreat from the Canadian oil sands sector because of depressed oil prices, a fast-shrinking universe of potential buyers may leave some stranded in the high-cost, capital-intensive sector.

Global producers are bailing on their oil sands investments due to higher development costs, limited export pipeline capacity to get crude to market and concerns about high carbon emissions in the sector. [nL2N1GC0FG]

International companies once drawn by the long-life assets that can produce for up to 50 years during the oil sector boom are discovering the economics do not work as well in a low-price environment.

But to get out, they have to overcome a simple equation: there are more sellers than buyers for the oil sands.

The three biggest domestic producers - Suncor Energy , Canadian Natural Resources Ltd and Cenovus Energy - are digesting multi-billion dollar deals, and have little room for more acquisitions, industry participants say. Global companies like ConocoPhillips and Marathon Oil Corp prefer to pile into cheaper U.S. shale plays such as the Permian basin instead.

"The market is pretty thin for oil sands buyers," said Janan Paskaran, an M&A lawyer at Torys LLP who advises domestic and international energy companies.

"There are three or four buyers out there that have said they are interested in increasing exposure to oil sands, but they've already done their shopping," he added. "I don't see any new entrants."

BP Plc has joined Chevron Corp in weighing the sale of its oil sands stakes, Reuters has reported. This follows decisions by Royal Dutch Shell , ConocoPhillips and Marathon to dump about $22.5 billion worth of largely oil sands assets this year. [nL1N1HS1KC][nL1N1HL0PQ]

BIG LOSSES

Companies that planned further divestitures from oil sands will either have to patiently sit on their assets or, as in the case of Statoil ASA and Marathon, accept a loss on their investments.

"There's not enough financial wherewithal in Canada to snap up all of the foreign investment that might be exiting right now," said Rafi Tahmazian, portfolio manager at Canoe Financial, referring to the domestic Canadian energy industry.

"You end up having to decide as a foreign company, am I willing to get rid of this cheap or do I hang on to it?"

Statoil booked an impairment charge of $500-$550 million, when it sold its oil sands assets to Athabasca Oil Corp . Similarly, Marathon sold its stake in the Athasbasca Oil Sands Project for $2.5 billion, having paid $6.2 billion to get into the region in 2007.

While some Canadian companies have stepped forward to take their place, their resources are limited.

Cenovus' share price tumbled after it loaded up on debt to buy ConocoPhillips assets. Suncor and Canadian Natural are in better shape financially but may have limited appetite for further deals after major acquisitions in the last 15 months.

Sources said Husky Energy , BP's joint venture partner in the Sunrise project, is not keen to increase its exposure to the oil sands but may consider buying BP's stake if the price is attractive.

"The prices will adjust to the supply of buyers and likely move downward," said John Stephenson, president of Stephenson & Co Capital Management, which owns shares in Cenovus and Canadian Natural.

GLOBAL LNG-South Korean tender stirs up market - 路透新闻

{{20170421T172314.932+0000}}GLOBAL LNG-South Korean tender stirs up market* Korea Gas Corp tender expected to net 10 cargoes -traders

* Market at odds over pricing

* Japan, China, Portugal, Spain, India show demand

* Immediate bullish signs outweigh concerns over Egypt

By Oleg Vukmanovic

LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - Asian spot LNG prices jumped this week, buoyed by hopes Korea Gas Corp's new tender would match past buying sprees and by emerging demand from China and Japan.

Spot prices for June delivery rose to $5.70 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), a 20 cent jump over last week, but traders cited sharply divergent views on pricing, saying the disagreements contributed to market inertia.

Still, Korea Gas Corp's Thursday tender for June and July supply [nL8N1HS4T5] - set to close on April 26 - immediately stirred up bullish offers, rescuing an otherwise muted trading week.

The last time Kogas entered the market to buy two cargoes in December 2016, it ended up awarding up to 11.

That was only one of a number of factors contributing to LNG snapping a 15-week losing streak, with Japan's Tohoku Electric seeking a May/June cargo alongside trading giant JERA's limited spot needs, Portugal's EDP seeking a June/July cargo, plus demand from Spain, India and China.[nL8N1HT3EW]

But a resumption in production at two Australian LNG export plants -- Chevron's Gorgon and Woodside's North West Shelf -- left the rationale for a price rebound less clear. [nL3N1HQ34S][nL8N1HT2Z5]

Demand, even in top-tier buyer Japan, is lacklustre and weather forecasts do not support a dramatic shift any time soon. Nigeria and Russia, meanwhile, have both approached the market with new supply. [nL8N1HT4DM] [nL8N1HT4H2]

"The market in Asia is basically anywhere between $5.50-$5.80, its pretty wide and nobody exactly knows ... there's a lot of inertia," one trading source said.

So far jitters over Egypt's nascent programme of cargo deferments -- a potentially bearish signal for global markets -- have taken a back seat to more immediate developments, such as Kogas purchases, but Egypt could come to dominate thinking once the scale of its programme becomes clear.

Surging production from new gas fields is squeezing out demand for costly foreign imports, leading Egypt to consider deferring as many as 25 shipments this year and many more in 2018, according to various sources.

Yet only a small portion of deferrals have actually been agreed with Egypt's LNG suppliers so far. Most of these are trading houses but some are state-backed energy companies.

Furthermore, one trader said some sellers had hoarded supply for May in anticipation of supply disruptions that never came.

"We will see how sellers react in June, given they lost value in May," the trader said, implying potential for supply releases.

In the Atlantic, demand continued to emerge from utilities in Spain, driven by low hydroelectric reserves, faltering renewables output and nuclear issues.

Spanish bids for LNG ranged from flat to UK gas hub prices to a 10 cent premium in some cases, several sources said.

Australian court dismisses Chevron appeal in landmark tax case - 路透新闻

{{20170421T030145.265+0000}}Australian court dismisses Chevron appeal in landmark tax caseMELBOURNE, April 21 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp lost an appeal on Friday against the Australian tax office in a landmark case in which the U.S. energy giant contested a tax bill of A$340 million ($260 million), including penalties and interest.

The full bench of the Federal Court dismissed the appeal against an earlier ruling that Chevron underpaid taxes by setting up a A$2.5 billion intercompany credit facility with an abnormally high interest rate which effectively lowered its taxable income within Australia.

Chevron said it was disappointed by the judgment in the case, which covers the five tax years from 2004 through 2008.

"We will review the decision to determine next steps, which may include an appeal to the High Court of Australia," a Chevron spokesman said in an emailed statement.

The case is a first test of how Australia's transfer pricing rules apply to interest paid on a cross-border related-party loan. It is being closely watched by multinational companies as governments around the world clamp down on what they deem elaborate means of reducing tax obligations.

"The economic effects of the internal financing structure put in place ... included CAHPL's (Chevron Australia Holdings Pty Ltd's) Australian taxable income being reduced by the deductions it claimed for the interest payments it made to its United States subsidiary," the court said in its latest ruling.

The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) said it was heartened by the ruling but noted Chevron could appeal to the High Court.

"This decision is significant and has direct implications for a number of cases the ATO is currently pursuing in relation to related party loans, as well as indirect implications for other transfer pricing cases," an ATO spokesperson said in emailed comments.

UPDATE 1-BP mulls sale of stakes in Canadian oil sands assets -sources - 路透新闻

{{20170420T184342.938+0000}}UPDATE 1-BP mulls sale of stakes in Canadian oil sands assets -sources(Adds details on past oil sands sales, potential Husky interest)

By John Tilak and Nia Williams

TORONTO/CALGARY, April 20 (Reuters) - BP Plc is considering the sale of its stakes in three Canadian oil sands projects, people familiar with the matter told Reuters this week, as part of the British oil company's strategy of retreating from noncore businesses.

BP's 50 percent stake in the Sunrise project near Fort McMurray in Alberta, where Husky Energy Inc owns the rest and is the operator, is the most valuable of the three assets. BP'S Sunrise stake is valued at about $810 million, based on recent transactions in the sector.

It also owns a 50 percent stake in Pike, operated by Devon Energy Corp , which is still awaiting a final investment decision, and is majority-owner of the Terre de Grace oil sands pilot project.

A BP spokesman declined to comment. Sources declined to be named as the information is confidential.

The three projects are located in northeastern Alberta.

BP has discussed with advisers the possibility of selling the stakes, though no final decision has been made, the people added.

If the sale proceeds, BP would deploy capital in more attractive regions, such as the Permian basin in the United States, where the rate of return tends to be higher, one of the people said.

BP's planned move comes after other global energy majors, including ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell have cut their exposure to Canada's oil sands operations, which are among the world's most expensive oil plays to develop. [nL5N1GM1VZ]

Faced with a lower oil price environment and challenging economics, which include high cost operations and carbon taxes, global players are increasingly put off by the oil sands.

Reuters reported last week that U.S. oil producer Chevron Corp was exploring the sale of its 20 percent stake in Canada's Athabasca Oil Sands project, which could fetch about $2.5 billion. [nL1N1HL0PQ]

BP is focusing its operations in Egypt, Azerbaijan, the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and Trinidad in the coming years.

Husky said in February that current production at the Sunrise project is about 36,000 barrels of oil per day. It is in the process of ramping up the project to full capacity of 60,000 bpd but progress has been slower than expected and the company is drilling extra wells to try to speed up production. Husky lowered the 2017 production forecast to 40,000-44,000 bpd from 60,000 bpd.

While Husky is not keen to increase its exposure to the oil sands, it may consider buying BP's stake if the price is attractive, two sources said.

Husky spokesman Mel Duvall declined to comment on whether the company had discussed buying BP's stake in Sunrise.

"We take a look at everything, but we have a number of organic growth opportunities," he added. ($1 = 1.3475 Canadian dollars)

{{20170420T110004.528+0000}}RPT-ConocoPhillips takes slow, steady route in race for oil profits(Repeats to additional customers with no changes to text)

By Gary McWilliams

HOUSTON, April 20 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips has beaten its 2017 asset sales target less than four months into the year, after shedding $30.8 billion worth of energy assets in six years.

But instead of a chorus of cheers on Wall Street, Chief Executive Ryan Lance is facing investor skepticism that the company can deliver growth from remaining oil and gas fields.

ConocoPhillips' most recent sales of Canadian oil-sands properties and U.S. natural gas wells for a combined $16 billion will part with nearly 30 percent of its proved reserves in order to deliver near-term shareholder payouts and pare debt. For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2pKHtZQ

Lance told Reuters the sales to Cenovus Energy and Hilcorp Energy Co will fulfill promises to reduce long-term debt by 42 percent to $15 billion, fund $6 billion in share purchases and help reshape the company for an era of low and volatile energy prices.

Drilling in two shale regions should help restore falling U.S. output by the fourth quarter.

"I don't worry about production and reserves in the company," he told Reuters in an interview, citing oil and gas fields that could be upgraded to proved reserves over time.

ConocoPhillips can achieve flat to 2 percent annual production growth on its properties, after adjustments for sales, and deliver shareholder payouts, he said.

But interviews with portfolio managers, former employees and industry analysts point to the frequent sales as a short-term fix. They worry ConocoPhillips' plan for modest production growth, flat capital spending and steady shareholder payouts pales in comparison to rivals that have retooled themselves to deliver sharply higher growth rates.

The danger of its reliance on fewer assets was driven home in recent weeks as a fire at a supplier hurt its ability to ship crude from oil-sands properties.[nL2N1HC1PW]

Mike Breard, who tracks energy stocks for Hodges Capital Management, said the strategy lacks appeal.

"If I wanted yield, I'd buy something else. If I wanted growth, I buy something else. I just don't see what customers would want to be in that in-between situation," Breard said.

The Houston company projects its daily production of crude and natural gas will fall 26 percent after the latest sales to about 1.16 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe). Barclays expects overall it won't return to production growth on a full-year basis until 2019.

"They've sold a very valuable asset," said Marc Heilweil, senior portfolio manager at Atlanta-based investment firm Gratus Capital, referring to the oil-sands holdings.

The deal will "make it harder for them to fully replace reserves down the line" because shale-oil properties have shorter productive lives, he said.

To ensure growth, oil producers must continually add reserves to offset production and the natural decline that occurs in oil-and-gas properties.

In 2012, ConocoPhillips spun off its refining business, leaving the ranks of the large, integrated companies like Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp , and putting it among a group of mostly-small U.S. independent exploration and production companies.

Lance, who was the company's technology chief, became ConocoPhillips' chairman and CEO upon the spin off. He pledged to boost output by 3 percent to 5 percent annually by tapping its large pool of deep-water, oil-sands and conventional oil-and-gas properties. That goal ended two years later as prices collapsed, forcing it to borrow heavily to cover its spending on production. ConocoPhillips later cut its dividend.

Its lack of exposure to refining has helped its shares stand out recently. The company's stock is down 4.3 percent year to date, even after an about 9 percent jump following the March 29 disclosure of a $3 billion addition to its share buy backs. In contrast, Chevron is 11.5 percent lower and Exxon is off about 10.8 percent in the same period.

Of analysts with published ratings on the stock, 7 rate it a strong buy, 11 rate it a buy and 6 rate it a hold. That compares to Chevron with 6 strong buy ratings, 12 buy ratings and 3 hold ratings.

VALUE FROM SHALE

Last fall, Lance recast ConocoPhillips as an energy company able to offer steady shareholder returns on flat production spending of about $5 billion a year. It shaved its growth target to as much 2 percent, instead of up to 5 percent, and promised 20 percent to 30 percent of operating cash flow would go to holders via dividends and buy backs.

He insists the remaining assets can generate substantial cash from operations even if oil falls below $40 a barrel. ConocoPhillips is ramping up output from its Eagle Ford and Bakken shale wells, from another oil-sands property and liquefied natural gas (LNG) from operations in Australia.

Meanwhile, rivals have cranked up their production much faster. U.S. shale-focused companies project 15 percent volume growth this year, says consultancy Wood Mackenzie, and the larger oil producers such as Chevron are raising output and delivering fatter dividends.

ConocoPhillips will be producing an average 1.25 million boe a day in 2019, estimates Barclays. In contrast, Chevron projects its daily output this year will rise between 103,000 boe and 233,000 boe over 2016's average 2.59 million boe, excluding divestitures. Chevron pays a 4 percent dividend.

The risk for ConocoPhillips investors is the growth in production doesn't generate higher free cash flow for share buy backs, and the 2 percent dividend yield, about half that of Chevron, becomes the bigger part of returns.

Henry Smith, co-chief investment officer at Haverford Trust, which invests in companies offering revenue growth and dividend gains, sold ConocoPhillips shares ahead of its 2016 dividend cut and has not been tempted back by the new strategy.

ConocoPhillips' pledge to deliver steady returns and growth is appealing, said Smith. But, he added: "Exxon over the years has fit that bill." Haverford's oil-industry holdings are Exxon Mobil Corp , Chevron and Schlumberger NV , he said.

Tom Bergeron, an equity analyst at Frost Bank, also prefers other oil producers such as Chevron and Occidental Petroleum Corp for what he said is their expected growth and their higher dividend yields.

Lance, who worked summers as an oilfield roughneck while studying petroleum engineering in Montana, said he understands investors want proof the company can deliver regular payouts without the asset sales.

"It'll probably take performance through a cycle to demonstrate we have the position and the passion to deliver," he said, referring to the industry's boom and bust periods.

CANADA STOCKS-TSX falls as oil slide hits energy stocks - 路透新闻

{{20170419T212356.438+0000}}CANADA STOCKS-TSX falls as oil slide hits energy stocks(Adds advisor comment, details, updates prices to close)

* TSX ends down 69.69 points, or 0.45 percent, at 15,552.88

* Six of the TSX's 10 main groups decline

By Alastair Sharp

TORONTO, April 19 (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index fell on Wednesday as sliding oil prices weighed on energy stocks, while solid earnings boosted Rogers Communications Inc and BlackBerry Ltd gained on a deal to get its cyber security tools in front of more potential customers.

The energy group -- which accounts for one fifth of the index's weight -- fell 1.5 percent as oil hit a two-week low with a surprising build in U.S. gasoline inventories and rising U.S. crude output undercut efforts by other countries to reduce a global glut. [O/R]

Canadian Natural Resources Ltd fell 1.2 percent to C$43.70 and Encana Corp lost 3.3 percent to C$14.88.

Offsetting the group's losses, Parkland Fuel Co jumped 6 percent to C$30.48 following news that would buy Chevron Corp's Canadian gasoline stations and British Columbia refinery for C$1.46 billion ($1.09 billion). [nL3N1HQ5LA]

The Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index <.GSPTSE> fell steadily throughout the session to end down 69.69 points, or 0.45 percent, at 15,552.88. Six of the index's 10 main groups finished in the red.

"To me, fundamentally, I think the Toronto Stock Exchange is going to be hard pressed to move significantly higher," based on expectations for a strong U.S. dollar, higher interest rates and lower oil prices, said Allan Small, a senior investment advisor at HollisWealth.

Shares of BlackBerry Ltd gained 3.1 percent to C$12.04 after the technology company said insurer Allied World would offer its cyber policyholders access to BlackBerry tools. [nCCNbtrxRD]

Small said the news supported the notion that BlackBerry's turnaround plan was working.

"I'm actually starting to look at BlackBerry again," he said, adding that he would nevertheless need to see the company return to profitability before buying the stock for clients.

Barrick Gold Corp was the biggest drag on the index, falling 3.4 percent to C$24.48. Shanghai-listed Shandong Tyan Home <600807.SS> said on Wednesday its negotiations with Barrick to buy a 50-percent stake of the Canadian operator's Kalgoorlie mine have ended without a deal. [nL1N1HR0ME]

Other gold miners also slipped, tracking gold prices, which edged lower on a stronger U.S. dollar. Gold futures fell 0.8 percent to $1,281.8 an ounce. [GOL/]

Rogers Communications Inc rose 1.5 percent to C$62.36 after the country's largest wireless company by market share reported a sharp rise in first-quarter profit and higher revenue after markets closed on Tuesday. [nL3N1HQ5EZ] ($1 = 1.3445 Canadian dollars)

CANADA STOCKS-TSX little changed as gold miners offset energy bounce - 路透新闻

{{20170419T153308.860+0000}}CANADA STOCKS-TSX little changed as gold miners offset energy bounce* TSX down 1.88 points, or 0.01 percent, to 15,620.69

* Four of the TSX's 10 main groups decline

TORONTO, April 19 (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index was flat on Wednesday as a modest bounce in energy stocks and a gain in Rogers Communication shares were weighed down by gold miners.

At 11:11 a.m. EDT (1511 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX composite index <.GSPTSE> was little changed, edging 1.88 points lower, to 15,620.69, reversing gains earlier in the morning session. Of the index's 10 main groups, four were in the red.

Canadian Natural Resources Ltd was among the most influential gainer, rising 1.2 percent to C$44.72, as was Suncor Energy Inc , which advanced 0.5 percent to C$41.19.

Parkland Fuel Co also helped the overall energy group, jumping 6.6 percent to C$30.67 following news that it bought Chevron Corp's Canadian gasoline stations and British Columbia refinery for C$1.46 billion ($1.09 billion). [nL3N1HQ5LA]

Energy stocks climbed 0.3 percent after slipping 0.9 percent in the previous session.

Offsetting the advances was a 0.9 percent decline by the materials group, home to precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies.

Barrick Gold Corp was the biggest drag on the index, falling 1.6 percent to C$25.94. Shanghai-listed Shandong Tyan Home <600807.SS> said on Wednesday its negotiations with Barrick to buy a 50-percent stake of the Canadian operator's Kalgoorlie mine have ended without a deal. [nL1N1HR0ME]

Other gold miners also slipped, tracking gold prices, which edged lower on a stronger U.S. dollar. Gold futures fell 0.8 percent to $1,281.4 an ounce. [GOL/]

The financials group, which make up about a third of the index's weight, gained 0.2 percent. Industrials, home to railway companies, rose 0.2 percent, with Canadian National Railway Co rising 0.6 percent to C$98.98.

Rogers Communication Inc rose 1.1 percent to C$62.08 after the country's largest wireless company by market share reported a sharp rise in first-quarter profit and higher revenue after markets closed on Tuesday. [nL3N1HQ5EZ]

Declining issues were almost even with advancing ones on the TSX, with 124 decliners versus 122 gainers.

The index was posting 14 new 52-week highs and no new lows.

UPDATE 1-Loblaw to sell gas station business for C$540 mln - Reuters News

{{20170419T122132.907+0000}}UPDATE 1-Loblaw to sell gas station business for C$540 mln(Adds details)

April 19 (Reuters) - Canadian grocery and pharmacy retailer Loblaw Cos Ltd said on Wednesday it would sell its gas station business to asset manager Brookfield Business Partners LP for about C$540 million ($402.17 million).

Brookfield said it intends to rebrand the gas stations, through an agreement with Imperial Oil Ltd , to Exxon Mobil Corp's Mobil fuel brand.

The sale includes Loblaw's 213 retail gas stations and convenience stores adjacent to the gas stations across Canada.

This deal will mark the introduction of the Mobil fuel brand in Canada, the companies said in a joint statement. [nCCN6bDqJl]

Chevron Corp also sold its Canadian gasoline stations and refinery in British Columbia to Parkland Fuel Corp , a marketer of petroleum products, for C$1.46 billion on Tuesday. [nL3N1HQ5LA]

Loblaw said the deal is expected to close in the third quarter of 2017.

RBC Capital Markets will serve as financial adviser to Loblaw, while Scotiabank will serve as Brookfield Business Partners' financial adviser.

UPDATE 1-Parkland Fuel to buy Chevron Canada's downstream fuel business - Reuters News

{{20170418T211752.573+0000}}UPDATE 1-Parkland Fuel to buy Chevron Canada's downstream fuel business(New throughout, adds details about deal and background about companies)

By Jessica Resnick-Ault

April 18 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp , the second-largest U.S.-based oil company, sold its Canadian gasoline stations and refinery in British Columbia to Parkland Fuel Corp , a marketer of petroleum products, for C$1.46 billion ($1.09 billion).

Parkland Fuel said it would acquire Chevron's refining and marketing operations in Canada and pay an additional $186 million toward working capital for the acquired business. [nCCN5K1g1x]

The acquisition adds scale to Parkland and gives the company "significant supply infrastructure and logistics capability to support Parkland's existing operations," Parkland CEO Bob Espey said in the statement.

The assets include 129 gasoline stations, three terminals and the Burnaby oil refinery, located east of Vancouver. The refinery can process 52,000 barrels of oil a day. It does not process bitumen, the heavy, tar-like substance extracted from Canada's oil sands.

Reuters previously reported that Chevron had retained Goldman Sachs to sell the plant. [nL1N1CO1YX]

Chevron is also exploring the sale of its 20 percent stake in Canada's Athabasca Oil Sands project, which could fetch about $2.5 billion, Reuters reported last week [nL1N1HL0PQ].

Last year, Chevron posted its first annual loss since 1987. The company is working on a two-year plan to sell $5 billion to $10 billion in assets in 2016 and 2017.

The company, aiming to achieve neutral cash flow this year, is also boosting spending on its low-cost Permian shale operations. [nL2N1HC1IA]

Amid business ties, some fund firms eased proxy pressure -study - 路透新闻

{{20170418T110008.395+0000}}Amid business ties, some fund firms eased proxy pressure -studyBy Ross Kerber

NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - Several big fund firms supported challenges on executive pay or climate disclosures less frequently where they had business ties to energy companies and utilities, according to a new study released on Tuesday.

The scrutiny of firms including Vanguard Group and Invesco Ltd is the latest research to raise questions about how well they manage potential conflicts of interest when casting proxy votes at the same time they are trying to win work like running corporate retirement plans.

"The business relationships seem to have an impact on how the managers are voting," said Edward Kamonjoh, executive director of the 50/50 Climate Project. The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit, which issued the report, looks to help investors and corporations work on issues like climate change.

Fund firms often are the largest shareholders of publicly traded U.S. firms, giving their votes outsized influence. Meanwhile climate and other governance matters promise to be hot topics in the shareholder meeting season this spring after Vanguard, BlackRock Inc and others have revised their policies on the area. [nL2N1GN1ML]

For its study 50/50 reviewed how fund firms voted on 27 proxy questions last year at oil and gas companies and utilities, tracking how often they voted against management recommendations.

At Vanguard, for instance, 50/50 found the $4 trillion Pennsylvania index fund manager broke from management 22 percent of the time. But at four companies where Vanguard serviced retirement plans, its funds did not support any challenges.

The votes could have mattered such as at Chevron Corp where 46 percent of votes cast opposed top executives' pay and Vanguard owned 6 percent of shares. Vanguard funds also opposed a resolution calling for Chevron to disclose the business impact of a rise in global temperatures, which won 41 percent support.

Vanguard spokeswoman Arianna Stefanoni Sherlock called the concerns raised by the study "unfounded" and said its voting operations are independent of its servicing work.

Vanguard changed its voting policies this year to leave itself more room to support environmental measures that create long-term shareholder value. Sherlock said the update was meant to showed the types of proposals it might support, and to eliminate abstentions.

Another fund firm, Invesco, broke with management 12 percent of the time, and at none of seven companies where it had business ties.

Invesco spokeswoman Jeaneen Terrio said where a conflict of interest may exist it will vote by policy or by a committee that excludes marketing and other customer-facing personnel.

RPT-ANALYSIS-Undaunted by oil bust, financiers pour billions into U.S. shale - 路透新闻

{{20170417T110003.183+0000}}RPT-ANALYSIS-Undaunted by oil bust, financiers pour billions into U.S. shale(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text)

By Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, April 17 (Reuters) - Investors who took a hit last year when dozens of U.S. shale producers filed for bankruptcy are already making big new bets on the industry's resurgence.

In the first quarter, private equity funds raised $19.8 billion for energy ventures - nearly three times the total in the same period last year, according to financial data provider Preqin.

The quickening pace of investments from private equity, along with hedge funds and investment banks, comes even as the recovery in oil prices from an 8-year low has stalled at just over $50 per barrel amid a stubborn global supply glut.

The shale sector has become increasingly attractive to investors not because of rising oil prices, but rather because producers have achieved startling cost reductions - slashing up to half the cost of pumping a barrel in the past two years. Investors also believe the glut will dissipate as demand for oil steadily rises.

That gives financiers confidence that they can squeeze increasing returns from shale fields - without price gains - as technology continues to cut costs. So they are backing shale-oil veterans and assembling companies that can quickly start pumping.

"Shale funders look at the economics today and see a lot of projects that work in the $40 to $55 range" per barrel of oil, said Howard Newman, head of private equity fund Pine Brook Road Partners, which last month committed to invest $300 million in startup Admiral Permian Resources LLC to drill in West Texas.

Data on investments by hedge funds and other nonpublic investment firms is scant, but the rush of new private equity money indicates broader enthusiasm in shale plays.

"Demand for oil has been more robust than anyone imagined three years ago," said Mark Papa, chief executive of Centennial Resource Development Inc .

Papa referred to the beginning of an international oil price crash in 2014, which took many firms in the shale sector to the brink of bankruptcy.

Centennial is a Permian oil producer backed by private equity fund Riverstone. Papa, a well-known shale industry entrepreneur, built EOG Resources Inc into one of the most profitable U.S. shale producers before he retired in 2013.

The chance to further develop the Permian, he said, was enough for him to come out of retirement to deliver one of its bigger recent successes. The value of Riverstone's original $500 million investment has grown nearly four times since Centennial's initial public offering last fall.

'A TON OF PRIVATE CAPITAL'

Riverstone this year copied the Centennial model, putting experienced managers atop a startup charged with acquiring operations or assets. The equity fund hired Jim Hackett - the former head of shale producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp - to run the newly created Silver Run Acquisition Corp II .

Hedge funds Highfields Capital Management LP and Adage Capital Management have taken stakes in the new company, which has a valuation of about $1 billion after going public last month.

Private equity fund NGP Natural Resources XI LP invested $524 million last fall in Luxe Energy LLC, a shale producer formed in 2015 by former Statoil executives.

NGP's investment was effectively a bet that Luxe could repeat its success of early 2016.

Then, NGP contributed about $250 million to Luxe, which used the money to acquire land in the Permian - and sold it seven months later for a double-digit profit. [nL2N15321C]

This year's drilling rush could be tested if global supplies grow too fast or if demand cools. The U.S. drilling rig count is rising at its fastest pace in six years and U.S. crude stockpile are close to 533 million barrels - near an all-time high and enough to supply the United States for 25 days.[nL2N1HD0VQ]

But some investors say even a decline of $10 in the oil price would not dissuade them.

"There is a ton of private capital to invest in the U.S. oil industry," said Gerrit Nicholas, co-founder of private equity fund Orion Energy Partners.

Nicholas said he is comfortable lending even if oil prices fall to $40 per barrel.

Orion this month helped finance the expansion of a Florida oil-storage terminal, a move predicated in part on growth in U.S. oil exports. Since the U.S. lifted its oil export ban last year, crude exports have climbed to about 746,000 barrels per day, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data.

BETTING ON OPEC'S SELF-INTEREST

The oil industry has seen boom-and-bust cycles since the first well was drilled about 160 years ago, and industry and government have sought to tame the volatility for just as long.

Texas regulators set output quotas from the 1920s through the 1970s, a practice that served as a model for the creation of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

The U.S. boom has caused concern among OPEC member nations ahead of its meeting next month in Vienna, where they will consider extending oil production cuts that first took effect in January. Investors believe the cartel's members will extend the cuts because it is in OPEC's financial interest to prevent a steep drop in oil prices.[nL5N1GU2QU]

That likely will keep money flowing to nimble U.S. oil producers and the companies that provide them with services and equipment. Investors see the United States as the new swing producer, having the ability to quickly increase supply in response to any sudden increase in demand.

"The U.S., with its substantial inventory capacity and swing oil producer status, should see strong onshore activity for the next few years," said Charlie Leykum, founder of private equity fund CSL Capital Management LLC, in an interview.

CSL has invested in several oilfield service business in the past year. It partnered with Goldman Sachs and Baker Hughes Inc , for instance, to create a shale services company.

Centennial's Papa expects the flood of fresh capital to push U.S. production up 23 percent to 11.3 million barrels a day (bpd) by 2020, based on strong demand for oil.

"We're still in a hydrocarbon-based economy," said Papa.

By John Tilak and David French

TORONTO/NEW YORK, April 13 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp , the second-largest U.S.-based oil producer, is exploring the sale of its 20 percent stake in Canada's Athabasca Oil Sands project, which could fetch about $2.5 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.

The company has discussed with investment banks the prospect of selling the stake in the western Canadian oil sands project, a source said.

The possible sale comes after Royal Dutch Shell last month agreed to sell most of its Canadian oil sands assets to Canadian Natural Resources Ltd for $8.5 billion. [nL5N1GM1VZ]

Chevron does not find the oil sands business appealing in the current environment, as low oil prices make it more challenging for global producers to generate profits, the people said, declining to be named as the matter is confidential.

The California-based company is close to making a decision, taking into account factors such as price, the sources added.

Canadian Natural is seen as a logical buyer as it will be the majority owner and operator of the Athabasca Oil Sands project once the Shell deal closes, the people said.

A Chevron spokesman and a Canadian Natural spokeswoman declined to comment.

The move comes as international players are pulling back from the Canadian energy market, particularly the capital intensive oil sands. A range of factors are contributing to investor apathy toward Canada, including weak oil prices, the higher cost of Canadian operations compared with cheap U.S. shale plays and limited export pipeline capacity out of western Canada.

Asked on Thursday about Chevron's possible sale and whether her government would consider tweaking policies to be more business friendly, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley told reporters: "What's going on frankly in the oil sands is you're seeing a reorganization, you're not seeing people pull back investment per se."

In March, ConocoPhillips , the largest independent oil producer, agreed to sell its oil sands and natural gas assets to Calgary-based Cenovus Energy for about C$17.1 billion ($12.9 billion).[nL2N1GM20K]

Chevron, which posted its first annual loss since 1987 last year, is working on a two-year plan to sell $5 billion to $10 billion in assets in 2016 and 2017. It is expecting to see several growth projects long in the planning, including Australian liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects, to come online this year.

The company is also boosting spending on its low-cost Permian shale operations, all with the goal of making Chevron cash-flow neutral this year. [nL2N1HC1IA] ($1 = 1.3247 Canadian dollars)

Chevron exploring sale of Canadian oil sands stake -sources - 路透新闻

{{20170413T135729.334+0000}}Chevron exploring sale of Canadian oil sands stake -sourcesTORONTO/NEW YORK, April 13 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp , the second-largest U.S.-based oil producer, is exploring the sale of its 20 percent stake in Canada's Athabasca Oil Sands project, which could fetch about $2.5 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.

The company has discussed with investment banks the prospect of selling the stake in the western Canadian oil sands project, one of the people said.

The possible sale comes after Royal Dutch Shell last month agreed to sell most of its Canadian oil sands assets to Canadian Natural Resources Ltd for $8.5 billion. [nL5N1GM1VZ]

Chevron does not find the oil sands business appealing in the current environment, as low oil prices make it more challenging for global producers to generate strong profits, the people said, declining to be named as the matter is confidential.

The California-based company is close to making a decision, taking into account factors such as price, the people added.

A Chevron spokesman declined to comment.

Chevron executive pay rises in 2016 on value of pensions - 路透新闻

{{20170411T214543.422+0000}}Chevron executive pay rises in 2016 on value of pensionsHOUSTON, April 11 (Reuters) - Compensation for three of Chevron Corp's senior leaders, including Chief Executive John Watson, rose last year due to a change in how the value of pensions are calculated.

The disclosure, required by U.S. regulators, comes as the oil industry grapples with low prices and Chevron, the second-largest U.S.-based oil producer, tries to bounce back after posting an annual loss last year, its first since 1987.

Chevron's shareholders will meet May 31 in Midland, Texas, for a nonbinding vote on the executive payouts. They will also consider resolutions related to climate change, lobbying and corporate governance.

Much of the executive compensation boost was due to the rise in value of pension plans tied partly to Chevron's stock, which climbed 28 percent last year as oil prices increased 47 percent. Age and other factors can effect actuarial calculations of a pension's value.

Watson, CEO since 2010, saw his compensation rise 12 percent to $24.7 million, fueled largely by the pension value increase. The value of stock and stock options awarded to Watson fell, as did the value of perquisites, including personal use of the company jet and home security. Watson's salary stayed nearly flat at $1.9 million.

Mike Wirth, head of the company's midstream division who became vice chairman earlier this year, saw his compensation rise 12 percent to $9.1 million. Wirth's salary rose but the value of his stock and stock option awards fell. The value of perquisites he received rose due to air travel.

Pat Yarrington, Chevron's chief financial officer, saw her compensation fall 11 percent to $6.5 million as the value of her pension fell, the only top executive to see a drop in pension value. Yarrington's salary rose but the value of her stock and stock option awards fell. The value of perquisites Yarrington received slid as she did not record any personal use of the company jet.

Jay Johnson, head of the company's oil and gas exploration division, saw his compensation rise 5 percent due to an increase in salary, stock options and the value of his pension. The value of perquisites Johnson received dropped by nearly 50 percent due to the cost of a home security system in the prior year.

Watson, Wirth and Johnson took their spouses on a September 2016 trip to Chevron's liquefied natural gas projects in Australia, costing $2,299, $16,014 and $2,243, respectively.

* Amazon gains after Needham upgrades to "buy"

* Indexes up: Dow 0.41 pct, S&P 0.37 pct, Nasdaq 0.38 pct

(Adds details, comments, updates prices)

By Yashaswini Swamynathan

April 10 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set to gain the most in nearly two weeks late-Monday morning as higher oil prices lifted energy stocks, while investors braced for big banks to kick off the first-quarter earnings season later in the week.

JPMorgan , Citigroup and Wells Fargo are scheduled to report earnings on Thursday and could throw some light on the U.S. banking industry's performance amid a rally in financial shares since the election of President Donald Trump. [nL2N1HC2BE]

Oil prices rose more than 1 percent, with U.S. crude hitting a more than one-month high, supported by a Libyan oilfield shutdown, tension over a U.S. missile strike on Syria and signs that an OPEC-led output cut is helping to clear excess supplies. [O/R]

Investors are keenly watching the quarterly earnings to justify lofty market valuations, following the post-election rally sparked off by bets that Trump would introduce pro-growth policies.

Earnings of S&P 500 companies are estimated to have risen 10.1 percent in the first three months of the year, the most since the fourth-quarter of 2014. The index is currently trading at 17.4 times forward earnings estimates, above its long-term average of 15, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

"The financial sector has been a darling performer since the election and we've seen some of that performance retreat in the last couple of weeks," said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis.

"So what the banks report and what their guidance is will be the primary driver for equity prices over the next week or two."

Thursday will be the last trading day of the week on Wall Street ahead of the Good Friday holiday.

At 10:55 a.m. ET (1455 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> was up 84.2 points, or 0.41 percent, at 20,740.3, the S&P 500 <.SPX> was up 8.75 points, or 0.37 percent, at 2,364.29 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> was up 22.63 points, or 0.38 percent, at 5,900.44.

All the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by a 1.1 percent gain in energy <.SPNY>. Chevron was up 1 percent while Exxon gained 0.6 percent.

A raft of deals also lifted sentiment. Shares of Straight Path Communications surged nearly two-fold to $90 after AT&T offered a huge premium to buy the owner of wireless spectrum licenses. The deal also lifted shares of other communications companies. [nL3N1HI46B] [nL1N1HI0GQ]

Swift Transportation jumped 23 percent to $24.64 after agreeing to a merger with fellow trucking company Knight Transportation . Knight's shares were up 13.5 percent at $34.75. [nL3N1HI3S9]

Amazon.com was the top stock on the S&P and the Nasdaq, rising 1.3 percent to $906.73. The world's largest online retailer was upgraded to "buy" at Needham, according to a trader.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,122 to 641. On the Nasdaq, 1,743 shares rose and 866 fell.

The S&P 500 index showed seven 52-week highs and two lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 51 highs and 17 lows.

U.S. drillers add oil rigs for 12th week in a row -Baker Hughes - 路透新闻

{{20170407T170407.227+0000}}U.S. drillers add oil rigs for 12th week in a row -Baker HughesApril 7 (Reuters) - U.S. drillers added oil rigs for a 12th
week in a row, extending the recovery into an 11th month as
energy companies boost spending on new production to take
advantage of a recovery in crude prices.

Drillers added 10 oil rigs in the week to April 7, bringing
the total count up to 672, the most since August 2015, energy
services firm Baker Hughes Inc  said on Friday.

During the same week a year ago, there were 354 active oil
rigs.

U.S. crude futures  traded at a one-month high just
below $53 a barrel on Friday after the United States fired
missiles at a Syrian government airbase, putting the contract on
track to rise for a second week in a row. [O/R]

Analysts projected U.S. energy firms would boost spending on
drilling and pump more oil and natural gas from shale fields in
coming years with energy prices expected to climb.

Futures for the balance of 2017  and calendar 2018
 were both fetching around $53 a barrel.

Chevron Corp  Chief Executive John Watson said the
company was set to boost development of its vast Permian Basin
holdings. [nL2N1HC1IA]

Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S.
investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the total oil
and gas rig count would average 851 in 2017, 978 in 2018 and
1,089 in 2019. Most wells produce both oil and gas.

That compares with an average of 749 so far in 2017, 509 in
2016 and 978 in 2015, according to Baker Hughes data.

Analysts at U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said in
a note this week that its capital expenditure tracking showed 57
exploration and production (E&P) companies planned to increase
spending by an average of 50 percent in 2017 over 2016.

That expected spending increase in 2017 followed an
estimated 48 percent decline in 2016 and a 34 percent decline in
2015, Cowen said according to the 64 E&P companies it tracks.

CORRECTED-BREAKINGVIEWS-BP's bonus rethink is still kind to Bob Dudley - 路透新闻

{{20170407T133330.092+0000}}CORRECTED-BREAKINGVIEWS-BP's bonus rethink is still kind to Bob Dudley(Corrects amount of Shell chief's maximum long-term incentive plan from 4 times salary to 6.8 times in fourth paragraph. The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Andy Critchlow

LONDON, April 6 (Reuters Breakingviews) - BP's slashed pay package for its chief executive still looks relatively kind. A 40 percent cut to Bob Dudley's total remuneration to $11.6 million in 2016 represents a reasonable way for the British energy giant to balance shareholder appeasement and retaining the American oil man's services. But the new package means he is hardly donning a hair shirt.

Dudley's annual bonus for the past year is consistent with his fair-to-middling performance. In 2016, BP managed a return on average capital employed of 2.8 percent and a total shareholder return of 30 percent – below Chevron and Shell . That explains why Dudley's annual bonus was 137 percent of his $1.9 million salary – rather than a maximum payout of over two times.

At first sight, his potential rewards going forward appear similarly measured. The company said in its remuneration report published on Thursday that Dudley's salary would stay the same and his "performance shares" – a longer-term bonus – would drop to a maximum payout equivalent to five times his base salary, down from seven times in 2015.

This still puts Dudley out in front of the pack, though. The maximum award for long-term incentives for FTSE 100 chief executives in 2016 was on average 250 percent of salary. Granted, Shell boss Ben van Beurden – who manages a bigger company still in the process of absorbing the complex takeover of BG Group – potentially gets the equivalent of 6.8 times for his efforts, on a lower basic salary.

Dudley's long-term bonus targets don't look excessively taxing, either. True, getting the whole payout means being first out of five compared to BP's main peers on a total shareholder return basis and achieving an 11 percent return on average capital employed. But to start paying out, he merely needs to be third out of five on total return, and hit a 6 percent return on average capital employed.

Shareholders will know that some of BP's problems, like a 55 percent drop in the oil price over the last five years, are out of Dudley's control. They also know he has drawn a line under the compensation BP had to pay for the Gulf of Mexico disaster in 2010. But over the last five years the company has underperformed total returns of Total , Chevron and Exxon Mobil in dollar terms, with only Shell being worse. Given that, the hair shirt could have been hairier still.

By Aaron Sheldrick and Osamu Tsukimori

CHIBA, Japan, April 6 (Reuters) - Japanese buyers of liquefied natural gas have shown cautious interest in Tellurian Inc's bold guarantee of U.S. LNG delivered at a fixed price from 2023, wary of locking themselves into a price that may eventually work to their disadvantage.

Tellurian Chairman Charif Souki - who pioneered the first U.S. LNG exports ex-Alaska as head of Cheniere Energy - stirred things up at the Gastech conference in Japan from the start, offering cargoes delivered to Japan at a flat $8 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). [nFWN1HB0HT] [nL4N1E3097]

That goes against four decades of selling LNG and building liquefaction plants worth billions of dollars on the basis of long-term, fixed-volume contracts linked to the price of oil.

Souki's move looked to be in keeping with LNG importers pushing for lower prices and better terms, yet even some of the most aggressive buyers seemed taken aback by the flat rate.

"Fixed prices are a gamble," JERA Co's chief fuel transactions office Hiroki Sato told Reuters in an interview at the conference when asked about Souki's offer.

"If you hear now that you can buy LNG for Japan at $8 in 2023, everybody would probably say it's cheap. But ... actions based on predictions rarely work out. That is how it works in the world," he said.

'NOT BUYING AT $8'

Tokyo-based JERA Co, a partnership of Tokyo Electric Power <9501.T> and Chubu Electric Power <9502.T>, is the world's biggest buyer of the fuel. Last month it joined with Korea Gas Corp <036460.KS> and China National Offshore Oil Corp [SASACY.UL] to form a club to force producers to drop so-called destination clauses. [nL3N1HC1DF]

Despite Sato's wariness, Souki "is a genius (for) throwing a stone in the pond and creating a ripple. I don't know how I evaluate that or if it is good or bad," he said.

During supply shortfalls - such as when the Fukushima nuclear crisis of 2011 led to the shutdown of Japan's reactors and imports of LNG and coal spiked to records to replace lost power generation - prices can run up rapidly.

Spot LNG prices in Asia were at more than $20/mmBtu in February 2014, for instance, but with the more recent surplus they are now trading at less than $6/mmBtu.

Buyers might decide that $8/mmBtu looked cheap if oil prices were at $80 or $100, said Ryosuke Tsugaru, chief executive of Diamond Gas International, a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp <8058.T>, said on the sidelines of the conference.

"But oil by nature is volatile. And if a fixed $8 turned out to be expensive, I don't know what they would do," Tsugaru said.

"I am not buying at $8," he said.

DRUM ROLL, PLEASE

Souki made his offer on Tuesday to deliver LNG to Japan at $8/mmBtu from 2023 under five-year contracts, including shipping. The offer covers an initial 7 million tonnes a year of LNG from Tellurian's planned Driftwood project in Louisiana.

"I think we will be sold out by the end of the year," he later said, as two Taiko drummers banged away at Tellurian's stand in the conference hall in Chiba near Tokyo, drawing a crowd of gas executives and onlookers who snapped pictures while drinking wine and champagne.

Souki told Reuters he had received a strong response from buyers in Japan, which takes about a third of global LNG output. He declined to identify any companies that had shown interest.

Australia's Woodside Petroleum is also considering sales of some of its LNG on a fixed-price basis, Chief Executive Officer Peter Coleman told reporters at a Gastech press briefing, although he mentioned no specific level. [nL3N1HC1TK]

"We can get to Japan for eight bucks, so it is fine with me," said Elizabeth Spomer, executive vice president at Veresen Inc and head of its planned Jordan Cove LNG project, when asked about the Tellurian offer.

The Jordan Cove terminal will be built in Oregon on the Pacific Coast of U.S. so is closer to Japan. Driftwood supplies from the U.S. Gulf Coast would need to come through the expanded Panama Canal or make an even longer journey.

"Charif is always provocative and it will be interesting to see what they do," Spomer said.

RPT-Chevron pivots to Permian shale as mega-project era fades - 路透新闻

{{20170405T100002.821+0000}}RPT-Chevron pivots to Permian shale as mega-project era fadesBy Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, April 5 (Reuters) - Nearly a century after Chevron Corp amassed the No. 2 stake in America's largest oilfield, Chief Executive John Watson is hitting the accelerator on developing the company's vast Permian Basin holdings.

In an interview, Watson made clear his desire to put the West Texas to New Mexico expanse in the ranks of Chevron's biggest ventures. That is a stark change from just five years ago, when Chevron executives rarely mentioned the shale basin.

But with low oil prices , the company is now spending more than it makes to cover its prized dividend and find new reserves. Now, those 2 million Permian acres have emerged as to way to help fund both goals.

"Some of the best things we have in our portfolio are the shales," Watson said during an interview on the 48th floor of the company's Houston office tower. "My employees in the Permian know I'm featuring it as something very important."

Gone, for the next few years at least, are plans for any new multi-billion-dollar mega-projects, he said. To survive and grow, San Ramon, California-based Chevron is turning to acreage it has always controlled and that largely is free of royalties to landowners.

"We're just in a period now where markets are weak and everyone is focused on controlling costs," Watson said.

Within a decade, Watson expects Chevron's production in the Permian to grow eightfold to more than 700,000 barrels of oil per day. By the end of next year, nine drilling rigs will join the 11 that Chevron already has poking holes into Permian land.

It is all part of Watson's plan to methodically pump Chevron's more than 9 billion barrels of Permian oil, most of it owned outright by the company. That gives Chevron a cost advantage over rival Permian producers as the region in the past year has become the epicenter for the U.S. shale resurgence.[nL1N1FM1EO]

Chevron's Permian portfolio, which was acquired in stages by predecessor companies, is worth at least $43 billion, Chevron believes, greater than the market value of Pioneer Natural Resources Co , Concho Resources and other Texas producers.

Watson bristles at critics who say the company is moving too slowly in the Permian. "We're growing our portfolio in the Permian as fast as anyone," said Watson, an economist by training who has worked at Chevron his entire career.

"We're focused on growing value and growing the dividend over time."

Chevron is valued more highly by investors than rival Exxon Mobil Corp partly because of that dividend, which has risen annually for the past 29 years. Watson has called protecting the $1.08 quarterly payout his top priority.

"We like inexpensive, recurring revenue streams" such as the Permian, said Oliver Pursche of wealth manager Bruderman Brothers LLC, which holds shares in the company.

Chevron, which does not hedge oil production, is boosting spending in the Permian by 67 percent this year to $2.5 billion, an implicit bet that oil prices will rise and lift the company to a profitable year after an annual loss in 2016.

That makes the Permian the second-largest area for spending this year for Chevron after the Tengiz project in Kazakhstan, which is not expect to come online until next decade.

CARBON TAX WOULD ADD COST

Watson said he is not worried about demand for oil hitting a ceiling for at least the next 20 years, despite the rising popularity of electric cars. Rising petroleum needs for air travel and petrochemical production should buffer any drop in demand from the automobile sector, he said.

"There is no sign of peak demand right now," Watson said.

Like Exxon, BP and other oil peers, Chevron supports the Paris climate accord, a 2015 agreement between nearly 200 nations that aims to limit the rise in global temperatures to "well below" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).

"We have said that Paris is a first step, but we need to understand what that translates to in terms of policy," Watson said.

Watson, however, has spoken out against a tax on carbon, something that Exxon supports.

President Donald Trump had considered a carbon tax as part of his proposed budget, but the White House on Tuesday said it was not under consideration. It could still be resurrected by Congress, where it has some support. [nL2N1HC24V]

"A carbon tax will have the effect of adding cost on the people who can least afford it," Watson said. "If you increase energy costs you are going to make it more difficult here for industrial activity."

Watson said he is not opposed to renewable energy, just government financial support for it through subsidies and other means. He said he would be open to buying a Tesla or another electric vehicle.

"I have no particular aversion" to electric cars, he said. "I'll buy a car that meets all my needs, particularly around size and other characteristics."

UPDATE 2-LNG supply gap may form as investment drop stymies projects - 路透新闻

{{20170404T103843.149+0000}}UPDATE 2-LNG supply gap may form as investment drop stymies projects* LNG shortfall expected to emerge in early to mid-2020s

* Prices at $7-$8/mmBtu could get LNG projects going -Woodside

* Tellurian offers LNG delivery to Japan at $8/mmBtu from 2023

(Adds detail, comment)

By Mark Tay and Aaron Sheldrick

CHIBA, Japan, April 4 (Reuters) - The global liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry will face a supply shortfall in about five years because low prices have discouraged investment in new production, major producers said on Tuesday at a gas conference in Chiba, near Tokyo.

Without the investments, suppliers may not be able to meet the needs of buyers such as Japan - the world's biggest importer of LNG - at a time when reducing emissions from other dirtier fossil fuels will be crucial to abate global warming, executives with international gas majors said.

"We are facing global overcapacity that is putting pressure on prices," Total SA Chairman and Chief Executive Office Patrick Pouyanne told the Gastech conference.

As a result, "the industry is entering a period of reduced investments … (that) could result in a lack of supply in five years. We must carry on investing for the future," he said.

LNG projects typically require billions of dollars of investment over many years of development. The industry has usually relied on long-term contracts linked to oil prices to ensure producers can get financing on favourable terms.

That has changed in recent years as buyers led by Japan and other Asian countries have been pushing for lower prices and better contract terms. The recent drop in oil prices has also meant some planned projects are not feasible. [nL3N1HC1DF]

Chevron Corp Vice Chairman Michael Wirth said earlier at the conference a "supply gap" could happen over the next few years if new projects are not approved. [nL3N1HC0W0]

During supply shortfalls - such as when the Fukushima nuclear crisis of 2011 led to the shutdown of Japan's reactor fleet, and imports of LNG and coal spiked to records to replace the lost power generation - price can run up rapidly.

Spot LNG prices in Asia were at more than $20 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in 2014, but with the more recent surplus they are now trading at less than $6 per mmBtu.

BETTING ON $8/MMBTU IN 2023

Other executives echoed Pouyanne and Wirth on the need for investments now to avoid a shortfall emerging in the early to mid-2020s.

They included Woodside Petroleum CEO Peter Coleman, who said buyers and sellers are starting to align on prices that can get projects going.

"Sellers are looking for prices above $7 per mmBtu; somewhere between $7 to $8 would get most projects going, and I think also that's a sustainable level for buyers," Coleman told reporters at the conference.

One seller is willing to gamble at those levels to win the chance to fill the potential supply gap.

Tellurian Inc said it will guarantee to deliver LNG to Japan for $8 per mmBtu from 2023 under five-year contracts, including shipping.

"I'm going to take the volatility out of the market," Tellurian Chairman Charif Souki told Reuters, after announcing his offer from the stage at Gastech.

Souki said deliveries would be from the company's planned Driftwood LNG terminal near St Charles in Louisiana, with the company taking care of all costs from gas field, LNG processing and delivery to Japan on an initial 7 million tonnes per annum in the "first phase".

Tellurian said on Monday it had filed an application with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to build a terminal that would eventually have a capacity of 26 million tonnes a year. [nFWN1HB0HT]

Gas supplies would come from a 96-mile (150 kilometre) link to interstate pipelines, the company said.

Ichthys to start shipping condensate by end-2017, LNG early 2018 -Total CEO - 路透新闻

{{20170404T072319.158+0000}}Ichthys to start shipping condensate by end-2017, LNG early 2018 -Total CEOBy Aaron Sheldrick

CHIBA, Japan, April 4 (Reuters) - Inpex Corp's <1605.T> $37 billion Ichthys Australian liquefied natural gas (LNG) project will start shipping ultra-light crude known as condensate by end-2017 and LNG shipments next year, one of the partners in the development told Reuters on Tuesday.

The comments from Total Chairman and CEO Patrick Pouyanne suggest further slippage in a project that has in recent months been hit by subcontractor disputes. [nL3N1GS1JA]

The shipment schedule, however, did not represent more delays in a project that was originally scheduled to start operating by the end of last year, Pouyanne said. [nL3N1GS1JA]

"We always said by year-end. You have two things. You have the gas production upstream and then it takes time. We have to fill the pipeline and then start the train," he said, referring to LNG production units, known as trains in industry parlance.

Condensate shipments will start by the end of this year, while "LNG (cargoes) will be more in the beginning of 2018."

This would appear to be a delay from a statement on Inpex's website that says production is now expected to start in the third quarter of 2017. An Inpex spokesman contacted by Reuters said the published schedule is unchanged.

Pouyanne said the subcontractor disputes were not holding up the start-up and that such issues are common to large projects.

The central processing facility will set sail from a South Korean shipyard "soon", he said.

Most of the LNG plants being built in Australia, including Chevron's huge Gorgon facility and Royal Dutch Shell's floating Prelude production vessel, are having trouble keeping within budget and on schedule. More delays are expected.

Once completed, Ichthys is set to produce 8.9 million tonnes of LNG per year and about 100,000 barrels per day of condensate at its peak.

Inpex holds 62.245 percent of Ichthys and Total 30 percent. The rest is spread amongst Taiwan's CPC Corp [CHIP.UL] and Japanese utilities Tokyo Gas <9531.T>, Osaka Gas <9532.T>, Kansai Electric <9503.T>, JERA Corp and Toho Gas <9533.T>.

LNG supply gap to open up if new projects not sanctioned -Chevron vice chairman - 路透新闻

{{20170404T044507.263+0000}}LNG supply gap to open up if new projects not sanctioned -Chevron vice chairmanCHIBA, April 4 (Reuters) - A supply gap is likely to open up in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry if new projects are not sanctioned, said Chevron Corp Vice Chairman Michael Wirth at a gas industry conference on Tuesday in Japan.

"In the short term, LNG supply is coming online faster than demand is growing, but with continued demand growth in the next decade the market will rebalance," Wirth said.

"So, while we expect ample supply in the next few years ... a supply gap could eventually confront us in the years to follow if we don't eventually sanction new LNG projects," he said.

Talk of Tokyo: LNG trio to test leverage in push to free-up purchases - 路透新闻

{{20170402T230001.989+0000}}Talk of Tokyo: LNG trio to test leverage in push to free-up purchases* Destination clauses likely to die soon -KAPSARC researcher

* No meetings scheduled for buyers' club, but delegates watching

* More "flexible and liquid" LNG market developing -IEA

* China, India emergence also driving spot LNG trade -Platts

By Mark Tay

SINGAPORE, April 3 (Reuters) - The world's gas industry is descending on Tokyo this week with something other than cherry blossoms on its mind: a trio of Asian LNG buyers testing their collective muscle in a push for more flexible long-term contracts for the fuel.

Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) <036460.KS>, Japan's JERA and China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) [SASACY.UL] - whose joint liquefied natural gas volumes account for a third of global LNG trade - are attempting to cement a shift in power from producers to importers amid a supply glut that is expected to persist into the early-2020s. [nL3N1H02FJ]

Developing responses from LNG producers to the group's alliance may also soon start to give clues as to who will win advantage as the fuel surplus puts pressure on suppliers to give buyers greater contractual freedom than they have had since the industry first began to ramp up in the 1970s.

"Destination clauses will probably die soon under the pressure of buyers and the growing needs for flexibility," said Anne-Sophie Corbeau, a research fellow at the King Abdullah Petroleum Studies and Research Centre (KAPSARC) in Saudi Arabia.

No meetings between the three buyers and major producers such as Royal Dutch Shell , Chevron and Qatargas have yet been confirmed at the Gastech biannual industry gathering, but representatives of all are certain to be in attendance, and other delegates are sure to be watching to see what happens when their paths cross.

North Asian LNG buyers - including those agreeing last month to explore joint purchases of supplies - have for decades relied on rigid long-term contracts that prevent cargo resales because the main priority was security of supply as energy demand soared amid double-digit economic growth.

But a slowdown in Asian growth over the past few years, especially in top two buyers Japan and South Korea, and impending liberalisation of gas and power markets mean dominant utilities are now often stuck with surplus cargoes they cannot resell amid stagnant or shrinking demand at home. [nL3N17W21I]

Last year for instance, global installed LNG capacity was over 300 million tonnes a year, while only about 268 million tonnes of LNG were traded, according to Thomson Reuters data.

JERA and KOGAS have both indicated they aim to ink only future contracts that have more flexible terms, but it remains unclear if they or other Asian buyers plan to force existing contracts into arbitration. [nL3N1GN3O1][nL4N1FS2ZV]

Many LNG producers have so far declined to comment on the rising threat from more aggressive buyers, although Australia's Woodside Petroleum suggested last week that flexibility in long-term contracts would eventually lead to a more liquid market. [nL5N1H624Q]

(For graphics on the global LNG market, please see http://tmsnrt.rs/2ofFm2U and http://tmsnrt.rs/2mXdqgu.)

DISRUPTION

Another disrupting force in the LNG market could be the emergence of importers like Pakistan that utilise floating storage and regasification units, who would also be small-scale buyers seeking shorter-term contracts. [nL8N1G538U] [nL5N1FL3BG]

"There are more new types of players coming into the market so it's no longer the long-term bilateral type of dedicated deals between utilities and exporters, but we're seeing a more flexible and liquid market developing," Keisuke Sadamori, director of energy markets and security for the International Energy Agency, told Reuters.

Asia, which accounts for about 70 percent of the world's LNG demand, is poised as well to benefit from rising U.S. exports that are on track to make the United States the third-largest exporter of LNG next year. [nL1N1G80HH]

U.S. LNG is attractive to Asian buyers as cargoes have no destination restrictions that prevent them from being resold when domestic power demand is weak.

"This growth (in spot and short-term contracts) is driven by several factors including ... the Japanese gas and power sector deregulations, (and the) uncertainty of LNG demand in Japan and Korea given potential nuclear power plant re-starts," said Marc Howson, LNG Senior Managing Editor at S&P Global Platts. [nL3N1H732X]

The emergence of price-sensitive buyers in India and China is also driving the market towards more spot trade, Howson said.

India does not rule out the possibility of joining the China, Japan and Korea grouping to jointly buy LNG to extract better deals, the country's Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said last month, adding that the market was gradually becoming more consumer-centric. [nD8N1FU00D]

UPDATE 1-Venezuela court move may facilitate Russian investment, spook other oil majors - 路透新闻

{{20170331T173319.303+0000}}UPDATE 1-Venezuela court move may facilitate Russian investment, spook other oil majors(Recasts headline, adds context, link)

By Alexandra Ulmer

March 31 (Reuters) - The sight of Venezuela's National Assembly president tearing up a Supreme Court ruling and warning foreign firms against making deals with the leftist government will no doubt resonate in international boardrooms.

The ruling ripped up by Congress head Julio Borges on Thursday was designed to allow President Nicolas Maduro to create oil ventures without congressional approval, easing investment in the cash-strapped country's floundering oil industry.

And it may well facilitate deals with companies including Russia oil major Rosneft , which Reuters reported earlier this month had been offered a stake in an oil joint venture with Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] as part of a broader deal with Caracas' key ally. [nL2N1GT1M4]

But the ensuing muddy legal framework and international outcry is likely to further raise anxiety levels at foreign oil companies already nervous about buying oil field stakes in Venezuela because of the country's shaky finances, as well as stricter regulatory scrutiny at home, according to oil executives, lawyers, and other industry sources.

Under the Venezuelan constitution, Congress must approve contracts of "national public interest" with foreign companies. But the Supreme Court just ruled Congress does not have a say over joint ventures anymore, while lawmakers retort the top court is illegitimate, creating a legal maze.

That bodes poorly for Venezuela's ravaged economy, which depends on oil shipments for over 90 percent of its export revenue as millions skip meals due to food shortages and roaring inflation. [nL2N1GR0O1] [nL2N1GZ2BS]

"This complicates any investment decision," said a Caracas-based source at a foreign oil company that partners with PDVSA, asking to remain anonymous because the person was not allowed to speak to media.

Still, Russia is becoming an increasingly crucial financier for isolated Maduro at a time when many other foreign companies were already reluctant to pour money into Venezuela given the poor business climate and debts.

And should Venezuela manage to pull off further sales or loans with Rosneft, that could help Venezuela make some $2.5 billion in bond payments due in April and shoulder other operational costs.

But while Venezuela may receive a short term boost from the decision, in the long-term foreign oil companies will likely be stymied from potential further investments in the country with the world's biggest crude reserves.

PDVSA and the oil ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Rosneft declined to comment, as did U.S. major Chevron Corp , which has four joint venture operations with PDVSA.

Spain's Repsol, which last year extended a $1.2 billion credit line to bolster a joint venture it has with PDVSA, also declined to comment. [nL2N1CD1CC]

Other foreign oil companies operating in Venezuela, including state-run China National Petroleum Corp <601857.SS>, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

SPOOKED INVESTORS

But for the low-profile foreign oil companies which remain in Venezuela despite a wave of nationalizations and company exits, the Supreme Court ruling is another worry amid complex currency controls, a brain drain, and out-of-control crime.

Many companies were already concerned about Venezuela's legal framework after the opposition took control of the National Assembly in January 2016 and warned oil majors that investment deals affecting national interest required their approval.

When Rosneft bought a stake in the Petromonagas joint venture early last year, the National Assembly slammed the purchase as "illegal" because it bypassed the legislature. Rosneft responded that the deal was legal.

And, bucking international condemnation of what Maduro opponents have called a slide into dictatorship, Moscow on Friday urged the world to leave Venezuela alone.

"External forces should not add fuel to the fire to the conflict inside Venezuela," the Russian government said.

Some companies may also be betting that they would have enough muscle to negotiate with a hypothetical opposition-led government in the future to "legalize" any purchases made without the congressional green light, sources say.

But the recent Supreme Court move is unlikely to assuage the fears of foreign partners who have strict internal compliance and legal guidelines, especially as protests and international condemnation grow. [nL2N1H80DA]

"This doesn't solve the problem," said Francisco Monaldi, fellow in Latin American energy policy at the Baker Institute in Houston.

"It might for the Russians, but I doubt an international company would dare do anything here. This can definitely put a brake on the creation of new joint ventures."

UPDATE 1-Petrobras eyes five major assets in new divestment program - 路透新闻

{{20170331T134422.983+0000}}UPDATE 1-Petrobras eyes five major assets in new divestment program(Adds details on assets, context)

By Bruno Federowski

SAO PAULO, March 31 (Reuters) - Brazil's state-run oil company Petróleo Brasileiro SA is eyeing five major assets for a renewed divestment program to be formalized in the next two weeks, after a court forced it to restart most of its $21 billion asset sale program from scratch.

In a securities filing on Friday, Petrobras, as the firm is known, said new divestments may include fuel distribution unit BR Distribuidora, shallow offshore fields in the states of Sergipe and Ceará, the Baúna and Tartaruga Verde oil fields in the Santos and Campos Basins, onshore fields in the state of Sergipe, and deepwater rights in the Gulf of Mexico.

The ruling by Brazil's federal audit court earlier this month allowed Petrobras to proceed with the sale of liquefied gas unit Liquigas, gas pipeline unit NTS and petrochemical companies Suape and Citepe, which already had firm buyers. [nL2N1GS243]

The sale of a stake in the Saint Malo field in the Gulf of Mexico was also exempted from the court ruling, but Petrobras said it would be called off because it "did not achieve the expected results," without elaborating.

Reuters reported on Wednesday that Petrobras scrapped the sale of the Baúna and Tartaruga Verde fields because the deal fell through after the Australian buyer's partner backed out amid protracted legal challenges in Brazil. [nE6N1FG01G]

Since Chief Executive Pedro Parente took charge in May 2016, Petrobras has pursued aggressive asset sales as it sought to cut the largest debt burden among global oil firms.

The Brazilian firm is particularly keen on restarting the sale process of BR Distribuidora, the country's largest fuel distributor and retailer, with 7,500 gas stations nationwide.
