Elon Musk to compete to fund high-speed Loop in Chicago  - Reuters News

{{20171130T035148.280+0000}}Elon Musk to compete to fund high-speed Loop in Chicago Nov 29 (Reuters) - Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk said on Tuesday The Boring Company will compete to fund, build and operate a high-speed Loop connecting O'Hare Airport to downtown Chicago.

Musk, the chief executive of electric car maker Tesla Inc and rocket company SpaceX, recently started the Boring Company to build transport tunnels for the system, which he says would be far faster than current high-speed trains and use electromagnetic propulsion.

Earlier on Wednesday, Chicago's Mayor Rahm Emanuel asked respondents to present proposals to develop, design, equip, finance, operate and maintain an O'Hare Express operating system through a public-private agreement with Chicago. (http://bit.ly/2j1rHsC)

"Although cost estimates for the project are not yet known, the RFQ (Request for Qualifications) stipulates that the O'Hare Express Service will be funded solely by project-specific revenues (like fares or advertising) and financed entirely by the concessionaire," Mayor Emanuel's office said in a statement.

"There will be no taxpayer funding for the project."

Musk is seeking to revolutionize transportation by sending passengers and cargo packed into pods through an intercity system of giant vacuum tubes known as the "hyperloop."

When asked on Twitter to elaborate on his "high-speed loop" proposal that would link O'Hare Airport to downtown Chicago, Musk tweeted, "A Loop is like a Hyperloop, but without drawing a vacuum inside the tube."

"Don't need to get rid of air friction for short routes," Musk added.

Passengers will travel in "electric pods for sure. Rails maybe, maybe not," Musk said in another reply.

By Alexandria Sage

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 29 (Reuters) - After Tesla's Model S sedans and Model X SUVs roll off the company's Fremont, California assembly line, the electric vehicles usually make another stop - for repairs, nine current and former employees have told Reuters.

The luxury cars regularly require fixes before they can leave the factory, according to the workers. Quality checks have routinely revealed defects in more than 90 percent of Model S and Model X vehicles inspected after assembly, these individuals said, citing figures from Tesla's internal tracking system as recently as October. Some of these people told Reuters of seeing problems as far back as 2012.

Tesla Inc said its quality control process is unusually rigorous, designed to flag and correct the tiniest imperfections. It declined to provide post-assembly defect rates to Reuters or comment on those cited by employees.

The world's most efficient automakers, such as Toyota <7203.T>, average post-manufacturing fixes on fewer than 10 percent of their cars, according to industry experts. Getting quality right during initial assembly is crucial, they said, because repairs waste time and money.

At Tesla "so much goes into rework after the car is done ... that's where their money is being spent," a former Tesla supervisor said.

The Silicon Valley automaker said the majority of its post-assembly defects are minor and resolved in a matter of minutes.

Tesla has enthralled consumers with sleek designs, clean technology and legendary acceleration on its pricey cars. A Consumer Reports survey found 91 percent of Tesla owners would buy again.

Still, the magazine and market researcher J.D. Power have dinged the company on quality, citing troubles such as faulty door handles and body panel gaps. Bernstein analyst A.M. (Toni) Sacconaghi, Jr. test-drove one of the company's new Model 3 sedans earlier this month, writing that the fit and finish were "relatively poor." Tesla owners have complained on web forums of annoying rattles, buggy software and poor seals that allow rainwater to seep into the interior or trunk.

Auto industry experts say the company's survival now depends on its ability to crank out high-quality cars in volume as it begins to build its first mass-market car, the Model 3, which starts at $35,000.

Tesla has never turned an annual profit and is burning through $1 billion a quarter. That is unsustainable without fresh cash or a big increase in sales to mainstream customers who may prove less forgiving of potential defects.

"We've never doubted Tesla's ability to make exciting products with top specifications, but there's a difference between unveiling something and then actually making it perfectly in large volume. Tesla has not perfected the latter yet," Morningstar analyst David Whiston wrote earlier this month.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has vowed the company would become "the best manufacturer on Earth," helped by a new, highly automated assembly line and a simpler design for the Model 3. However, production woes have slowed deliveries of the much-anticipated sedan.[nL2N1N72DJ]

Snags are normal with any new launch. But chronic defects with Tesla's established Models S and X show a company still struggling to master basic manufacturing, workers said.

Known as "kickbacks" within Tesla, these vehicles have glitches as minor as dents and scratches to more complex troubles such as malfunctioning seats. Easy fixes are made swiftly on the factory floor, workers said.

Trickier cases head to one of Tesla's outdoor parking lots to await repair. The backlog in one of those two lots, dubbed the "yard," has exceeded 2,000 vehicles at times, workers told Reuters.

Tesla denied to Reuters that such "repair lots" exist.

Reuters interviewed nine current and former Tesla employees, including a former senior manager, with experience in assembly, quality control and repairs on Model S and Model X. All requested anonymity because the company required them to sign non-disclosure agreements. Four of the people were fired for cause, including two last month as part of a mass dismissal of hundreds of workers for what Tesla said was poor performance. [nL2N1MP02E] Sacked workers who spoke with Reuters denied they were poor performers.

People with knowledge of Tesla's internal quality data shared those figures with Reuters. The news agency was unable to confirm the information independently.

Defects included "doors not closing, material trim, missing parts, all kinds of stuff. Loose objects, water leaks, you name it," another former supervisor said. "We've been building a Model S since 2012. How do we still have water leaks?"

Tesla shares were down 3.4 percent to $306.60 in afternoon trading on Wednesday.

BUILD FAST, FIX LATER

Tesla disputed workers' portrayal of the automaker as struggling to produce defect-free vehicles. A spokesperson described a rigorous process that requires all cars to pass more than 500 inspections and tests. Any reworking of cars after assembly reflects the company's commitment to quality, the spokesperson said.

"Our goal is to produce perfect cars for every customer," Tesla said in a statement. "Therefore, we review every vehicle for even the smallest refinement. Most customers would never notice the work that is done post production, but we care about even a fraction of a millimeter body gap difference or a slight paint gloss texture. We then feed these improvements back to production in a pursuit of perfection."

Employees who worked on Model S and Model X described pressure to keep the assembly line moving, even when problems emerged. Some told of batches of cars being sent through with parts missing - windshields in one case, bumpers in another - because there were none on hand. The understanding, they said, was that these and other flaws would be fixed later.

Quality inspectors would sometimes find more defects than those reported by workers in the internal tracking system when a car came off the line. "We'd see two issues, that's pretty good. But then we'd dig in and there would be like 15 or 20," one person said.

One persistently tricky area was alignment, where body parts had to be "muscled," in the words of the senior manager, to a certain degree of flushness. Not every team follows the same rule book, workers said, resulting in gaps of different size.

Tesla denied that its quality control is inconsistent and said its "extensive" process for locating and fixing errors was "very successful."

Some workers traced the challenges to Musk's determination to launch vehicles faster than the industry norm by shortening the design process, skipping some pre-production testing, then making improvements on the fly. [nL1N1HW025] Such improvisation leads to high repair rates, employees said.

For a March report called "Beyond the Hype," J.D. Power found creaks, scratches and poor door alignment on new Model S and Model X vehicles, issues it blamed on the company's lack of manufacturing experience. The overall quality of Tesla vehicles, it concluded, was "not competitive" within the luxury segment, lacking "precision and attention to detail."

Such sloppiness is a rarity in luxury brands such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW , said Kathleen Rizk, director of global automotive consulting at J.D. Power.

"Those companies have been manufacturing forever," she said. "They have stopgaps."

Tesla said its high customer satisfaction proves it is building the "safest and best-performing cars available today."

Taco truck halts GM autonomous car's cruise through city streets - Reuters News

{{20171129T130012.396+0000}}Taco truck halts GM autonomous car's cruise through city streetsBy Alexandria Sage

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 29 (Reuters) - A self-driving General Motors Co Bolt slowly drove more than two miles through crowded San Francisco streets in its media debut on Tuesday, but double-parked cars and orange traffic cones tripped up the computer driver, and a taco truck stumped the machine.

GM's self-driving unit, Cruise Automation, gave reporters rides on Tuesday, the first public roadtrips for non-employees in its cars which have been tested in San Francisco, Phoenix and Detroit.

Major automakers as well as technology leaders like Alphabet Inc and Intel Corp have poured billions into autonomous vehicle research, although fully self-driving cars are a work in progress. Robo-taxi service is seen as the main use for most self-driving vehicles, including the Bolt.

"Our mission is to bring this technology to commercial deployment at scale, with safety, as soon as we humanly can do that," GM President Dan Ammann told reporters. He repeated Chief Executive Mary Barra's promise in October that GM would roll out self-driving cars within "quarters, not years."

During a roughly 15-minute ride in a busy area of San Francisco over a 2.2 mile (3.5km) trip, the Cruise-enhanced electric Bolt carrying a Reuters journalist encountered 117 people, 4 bikes and 129 cars, according to the car's sensors.

The car, never moving more than 20 miles per hour, navigated urban traffic, a tram line, construction zones, pedestrians crossing streets and many double-parked vehicles. Urban environments are as much as 46 times more complex than suburban areas, Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt said.

The Bolt reacted more conservatively than a human driver, for example slowing to a near stop after sensing a bike approaching in the opposite lane.

"Looking for a clear path" screens facing the driver and passengers read several times during the trip, when the car stopped next to some traffic cones or behind double-parked vehicles. After pauses, it restarted and passed the obstacles by itself.

A taco truck was too much, though. The Bolt's human backup driver disengaged the system and took the wheel after the car waited for more than a minute behind the truck where construction workers ordered lunch.

Vogt said those issues would improve over time and that the winner of the self-driving car race would be the one that first launches at "massive scale" rather than just being the first to market a model.

GM over the past several months has regained its status as the largest U.S. automaker by market capitalization over electric luxury car maker Tesla Inc .

Some of GM's share surge has come from investors betting on its investments in self-driving and electric cars, although the company's profits are driven entirely by demand for trucks and SUVs in North America, and its growing sales in China.[nL2N1MZ0FE]

"GM is aiming to more fundamentally alter investor perception on their position," wrote Barclays analyst Brian Johnson in a note to clients on Tuesday.

Alphabet's self-driving unit Waymo often is seen as company to beat in the emerging sector. It announced in November that it would launch a self-driving robo-taxi service in suburban Phoenix, carrying its first passengers in the next few months. [nL1N1ND197]

Earlier this month, GM said it would launch a range of electric vehicles in 2021 in a direct challenge to market leader Tesla, which is struggling to ramp up its more affordable, high-volume Model 3. [nL2N1N72DJ]

BMW looking for partners to develop electric small cars - Reuters News

{{20171129T083910.796+0000}}BMW looking for partners to develop electric small carsBy Joseph White

LOS ANGELES, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Germany's BMW AG is talking with other automakers "around the world" to try to find partners to lower the cost of electrifying its future Mini small cars, management board member Peter Schwarzenbauer told Reuters.

"We are talking to many OEMs (manufacturers) around the world, not only in China, (about) how to electrify smaller cars," Schwarzenbauer said. "There's no final conclusion on it."

Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor Co <601633.SS> said last month it was discussing a possible venture to build Mini vehicles in China. BMW currently does not build Mini vehicles outside Europe. [nL8N1MO2M8]

Schwarzenbauer declined to discuss the Great Wall situation, saying "this was speculation."

However, he said building smaller electric cars was challenging, not only because of the financial costs, but also the engineering problem of fitting batteries with sufficient range into a smaller vehicle package.

BMW has worked with rivals before to share the costs of clean vehicle technology. The automaker has a partnership with Japan's Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> to develop fuel cell vehicles.

BMW has said it plans to launch a new, electric Mini model in 2019. Eventually, Mini could become an entirely electric brand, aimed at urban consumers, Schwarzenbauer said.

Mini sales in the United States have fallen 10 percent through the first ten months of this year, as demand for many smaller cars has waned in favor of sport-utility vehicles and trucks.

"It's really only in the U.S. where we are facing this with Mini," Schwarzenbauer said.

BMW will not try to reverse that trend by adding larger SUVs to the Mini lineup, Schwarzenbauer said. Instead, he said, "the way for Mini in the U.S. is ... building the Mini brand in the direction of the electric urban mobility company."

On a separate issue, Schwarzenbauer said BMW intended to offer a self-driving car planned to debut in 2021 at a price that could be below $100,000.

The iNEXT model, which BMW previewed earlier this year, will be offered to individuals, ride services fleets and put into service in BMW fleets, Schwarzenbauer said.

"By 2021, you will have a lot of people who want to own this car," he said. "It will be a normal price. We are thinking of scaling this. To bring a $150,000 electric car is nice, but it will not really scale."

When it launches, the iNEXT may not be offered with complete, so-called Level 5, autonomy because the regulatory and legal frameworks for such a vehicle likely won't be in place, Schwarzenbauer said.

INSIGHT-Build fast, fix later: speed hurts quality at Tesla, some workers say - Reuters News

{{20171129T060001.886+0000}}INSIGHT-Build fast, fix later: speed hurts quality at Tesla, some workers sayBy Alexandria Sage

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 29 (Reuters) - After Tesla's Model S sedans and Model X SUVs roll off the company's Fremont, California assembly line, the electric vehicles usually make another stop - for repairs, nine current and former employees have told Reuters.

The luxury cars regularly require fixes before they can leave the factory, according to the workers. Quality checks have routinely revealed defects in more than 90 percent of Model S and Model X vehicles inspected after assembly, these individuals said, citing figures from Tesla's internal tracking system as recently as October. Some of these people told Reuters of seeing problems as far back as 2012.

Tesla Inc said its quality control process is unusually rigorous, designed to flag and correct the tiniest imperfections. It declined to provide post-assembly defect rates to Reuters or comment on those cited by employees.

The world's most efficient automakers, such as Toyota <7203.T>, average post-manufacturing fixes on fewer than 10 percent of their cars, according to industry experts. Getting quality right during initial assembly is crucial, they said, because repairs waste time and money.

At Tesla "so much goes into rework after the car is done ... that's where their money is being spent," a former Tesla supervisor said.

The Silicon Valley automaker said the majority of its post-assembly defects are minor and resolved in a matter of minutes.

Tesla has enthralled consumers with sleek designs, clean technology and legendary acceleration on its pricey cars. A Consumer Reports survey found 91 percent of Tesla owners would buy again.

Still, the magazine and market researcher J.D. Power have dinged the company on quality, citing troubles such as faulty door handles and body panel gaps. Bernstein analyst A.M. (Toni) Sacconaghi, Jr. test-drove one of the company's new Model 3 sedans earlier this month, writing that the fit and finish were "relatively poor." Tesla owners have complained on web forums of annoying rattles, buggy software and poor seals that allow rainwater to seep into the interior or trunk.

Auto industry experts say the company's survival now depends on its ability to crank out high-quality cars in volume as it begins to build its first mass-market car, the Model 3, which starts at $35,000.

Tesla has never turned an annual profit and is burning through $1 billion a quarter. That is unsustainable without fresh cash or a big increase in sales to mainstream customers who may prove less forgiving of potential defects.

"We've never doubted Tesla's ability to make exciting products with top specifications, but there's a difference between unveiling something and then actually making it perfectly in large volume. Tesla has not perfected the latter yet," Morningstar analyst David Whiston wrote earlier this month.

Musk has vowed Tesla would become "the best manufacturer on Earth," helped by a new, highly automated assembly line and a simpler design for the Model 3. However, production woes have slowed deliveries of the much-anticipated sedan.[nL2N1N72DJ]

Snags are normal with any new launch. But chronic defects with Tesla's established Models S and X show a company still struggling to master basic manufacturing, workers said.

Known as "kickbacks" within Tesla, these vehicles have glitches as minor as dents and scratches to more complex troubles such as malfunctioning seats. Easy fixes are made swiftly on the factory floor, workers said.

Trickier cases head to one of Tesla's outdoor parking lots to await repair. The backlog in one of those two lots, dubbed the "yard," has exceeded 2,000 vehicles at times, workers told Reuters.

Tesla denied to Reuters that such "repair lots" exist.

Reuters interviewed nine current and former Tesla employees, including a former senior manager, with experience in assembly, quality control and repairs on Model S and Model X. All requested anonymity because the company required them to sign non-disclosure agreements. Four of the people were fired for cause, including two last month as part of a mass dismissal of hundreds of workers for what Tesla said was poor performance. [nL2N1MP02E] Sacked workers who spoke with Reuters denied they were poor performers.

People with knowledge of Tesla's internal quality data shared those figures with Reuters. The news agency was unable to confirm the information independently.

Defects included "doors not closing, material trim, missing parts, all kinds of stuff. Loose objects, water leaks, you name it," another former supervisor said. "We've been building a Model S since 2012. How do we still have water leaks?"

BUILD FAST, FIX LATER

Tesla disputed workers' portrayal of the automaker as struggling to produce defect-free vehicles. A spokesperson described a rigorous process that requires all cars to pass more than 500 inspections and tests. Any reworking of cars after assembly reflects the company's commitment to quality, the spokesperson said.

"Our goal is to produce perfect cars for every customer," Tesla said in a statement. "Therefore, we review every vehicle for even the smallest refinement. Most customers would never notice the work that is done post production, but we care about even a fraction of a millimeter body gap difference or a slight paint gloss texture. We then feed these improvements back to production in a pursuit of perfection."

Employees who worked on Model S and Model X described pressure to keep the assembly line moving, even when problems emerged. Some told of batches of cars being sent through with parts missing - windshields in one case, bumpers in another - because there were none on hand. The understanding, they said, was that these and other flaws would be fixed later.

Quality inspectors would sometimes find more defects than those reported by workers in the internal tracking system when a car came off the line. "We'd see two issues, that's pretty good. But then we'd dig in and there would be like 15 or 20," one person said.

One persistently tricky area was alignment, where body parts had to be "muscled," in the words of the senior manager, to a certain degree of flushness. Not every team follows the same rule book, workers said, resulting in gaps of different size.

Tesla denied that its quality control is inconsistent and said its "extensive" process for locating and fixing errors was "very successful."

Some workers traced the challenges to Musk's determination to launch vehicles faster than the industry norm by shortening the design process, skipping some pre-production testing, then making improvements on the fly. [nL1N1HW025] Such improvisation leads to high repair rates, employees said.

For a March report called "Beyond the Hype," J.D. Power found creaks, scratches and poor door alignment on new Model S and Model X vehicles, issues it blamed on the company's lack of manufacturing experience. The overall quality of Tesla vehicles, it concluded, was "not competitive" within the luxury segment, lacking "precision and attention to detail."

Such sloppiness is a rarity in luxury brands such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW , said Kathleen Rizk, director of global automotive consulting at J.D. Power.

"Those companies have been manufacturing forever," she said. "They have stopgaps."

Tesla said its high customer satisfaction proves it is building the "safest and best-performing cars available today."

RPT-COLUMN-Cobalt, the heart of darkness in the shiny electric vehicle story: Andy Home - 路透新闻

{{20171129T010001.671+0000}}RPT-COLUMN-Cobalt, the heart of darkness in the shiny electric vehicle story: Andy Home(Repeats without change. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters)

By Andy Home

LONDON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - The electric vehicle (EV) story continues to gather momentum, with even major oil companies scrambling to join the coming green energy revolution.

Royal Dutch Shell has just announced a partnership with leading automotive companies to install super-fast chargers on European highways. [nL8N1NU2IF]

But as ever more companies sign up to the bright, shiny EV future, there is rising concern about the heart of darkness in this new technology -- you can't power an EV without a lithium-ion battery and, for now at least, you can't make a battery without using cobalt.

And most of the world's cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a country racked by political instability, legal opacity and, at its darkest, child labour in its mines.

This concentration of supply risk, both in terms of physical units and ethical sourcing, isn't going away any time soon and could even worsen.

THE DARK SIDE

The DRC accounted for 66,000 tonnes of global mined cobalt production of 123,000 tonnes last year, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

That's the official sector. There is also an artisanal stream of production, some of it using child labour and some of it controlled by insurgent militias.

Quite how much cobalt this grey sector generates is the main "known unknown" in any analysis of world production.

But it is an undisputed fact that it has been seeping into the official supply chain for years.

Speaking at a London Metal Exchange (LME) seminar in October, Tony Southgate, head of cobalt marketing at Eurasian Resources Group, warned that "it's almost inevitable (...) there are mobile phones in this room" containing cobalt from child labour in the DRC.

The issue has moved to the top of the LME's own agenda after complaints that one of its registered brands, produced by China's Yantai Cash Industrial, could include metal sourced from the dark side of the DRC cobalt sector.

The LME has written to producers asking for assurances on ethical and socially responsible minerals sourcing, while Yantai told the Financial Times that it is conducting its own due diligence exercise.

LEGAL OPACITY

Child labour is only one of multiple problems posed by the DRC to the emergence of an efficient raw materials chain for commodities used in batteries.

The legal and financial framework around the country's mining sector is both opaque and tinged with political interference.

A recent study by U.S. advocacy group The Carter Center described state mining company Gecamines as operating a "parallel state" and concluded that $750 million from DRC's copper mine privatisation process cannot be tracked reliably.

Such allegations are vehemently denied by the DRC government, but legal controversy is never too far away in the DRC mining sector.

Glencore , one of the leading operators in the country, has been sucked into a controversy surrounding the role of Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler in the acquisition of assets now operated by its Katanga Mining subsidiary. [nL5N1GG1Y5]

Another operator, Groupe Forrest, is in legal dispute with Gecamines after the latter blocked access to its production site this year and awarded mining rights to another entity, Bloomberg reported.

This particular three-way court tussle is having a direct market impact because production at the site has been halted, taking about 5,000 tonnes of cobalt out of the supply equation this year.

THE FUTURE IS (DRC) COBALT

Frankly, if the rest of the world could, it would happily not source any cobalt from the DRC.

And the likes of Tesla and Apple are trying to do just that, working with potential future producers in Canada and the United States to create their own cobalt supply chains.

There is no shortage of junior miner contestants in this ethical cobalt beauty contest, but right now the DRC is the dominant producer. And it's going to remain so for the foreseeable future.

Six of the top 10 cobalt-producing assets last year were located in the DRC, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

In 2022 the number will rise to nine out of the top 10, it forecasts. ("Cobalt - Supercharged as supply chain risk increases")

Quite simply, unless someone works out how to engineer cobalt out of the lithium-ion battery, the world is going to need a lot more cobalt and it's still going to get most of it from the DRC.

DANGEROUS DEPENDENCY

This is a dangerously concentrated dependency, leaving a whole supply chain beholden to the political, legal and ethical uncertainties surrounding the DRC's mining sector.

The only comparison, S&P Global suggests, is a similar concentration of platinum production in South Africa.

When that country was roiled by a wave of industrial action in 2014, it translated into a 20 percent dent in global supply that year. At least there were above-ground platinum stocks to fill the supply gap.

Whether there would be sufficient inventory of cobalt to buffer the market against serious disruption in the DRC is a very moot point.

The arrival of automotive companies to this dysfunctional market could in theory be a game-changer if they stimulate more supply and force a collective industry move to responsible sourcing.

A template already exists in the form of the iTSCi programme aimed at improving transparency in the tin-tantalum-tungsten mining sector of central Africa, including particularly challenging operating environments such as Kivu Province in the DRC.

Right now, however, a company such as Volkswagen is still at the early stage of simply trying to secure enough units to deliver on its electrification promise.

Attempts to lock in future supply at prices below current levels have not yet yielded any tangible results. [nL8N1NX3G4]

VW and other automakers are learning, to quote Rebecca Gordon, head of technology metals at CRU, "the value of cobalt in the ground".

Investing at the mine site would be one way of simultaneously ensuring supply in outright tonnage terms and in socially acceptable terms.

Most car companies are still understandably wary of getting involved at such an upstream part of a supply chain, but if they don't, they will remain exposed to whatever happens in the heart of darkness that is the DRC.

UPDATE 1-Tesla Truck gets DHL order as shippers test Semi - Reuters News

{{20171128T213008.629+0000}}UPDATE 1-Tesla Truck gets DHL order as shippers test Semi(Adds pricing information on the Tesla Semi, paragraph 6)

By Eric M. Johnson

SEATTLE, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Deutsche Post AG's DHL and Fortigo Freight Services Inc, one of Canada's largest fleet management companies, said on Tuesday they had pre-ordered Tesla Inc's electric truck unveiled earlier this month to test on limited routes.

High-profile logistics and transportation customers like fleet operator J.B. Hunt and retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc announced orders for the Tesla Semi after it was unveiled on Nov. 16. [nL1N1NM1N4] [nL3N1NN3V7]

The Semi, scheduled for rollout in 2019, is Tesla's next step to move the economy away from fossil fuels through electric cars, solar roofs and power storage.

DHL Supply Chain, which provides transportation, warehousing and distribution services for U.S. manufacturers and retailers, ordered 10 trucks to test at customer facilities in major U.S. cities, the company said in a statement.

"The trucks will be used for shuttle runs and same-day customer deliveries, and will be tested for fuel efficiency on longer runs from major markets to other DHL operations across the country," the company said.

Fortigo, based in Etobicoke, Ontario, ordered one Tesla Semi with a down payment of about 26,000 Canadian dollars (U.S. $20,290), with a balance due of under U.S. $181,000 when the Tesla is delivered, Chief Executive Elias Demangos said by email on Tuesday.

"We'll be running it in a pilot program to ensure it meets our business objectives," Demangos said.

Tesla will not provide a tally of orders it has received for the truck, company spokesman Dave Arnold said in an email.

The limited early orders reflect uncertainty about the market for electric commercial vehicles. The 500-mile (800 km) range between charges for the Tesla Semi is about half the range between fill-ups of a diesel Class 8 truck. Heavy batteries cut payload and add cost, potential deal killers for fleet buyers focused on operating cost per mile. [nL1N1NM1N4]

However, Tesla, and truck makers such as Daimler AG , Navistar International Corp and its partner Volkswagen AG are investing in electric models in a bet that the market will shift over the next decade.

DHL orders 10 Tesla Semi electric trucks, mainly for shorter routes - Reuters News

{{20171128T191453.725+0000}}DHL orders 10 Tesla Semi electric trucks, mainly for shorter routesBy Eric M. Johnson

SEATTLE, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Deutsche Post AG's DHL and Fortigo Freight Services Inc, one of Canada's largest fleet management companies, said on Tuesday they have pre-ordered Tesla Inc's electric truck unveiled earlier this month to test on limited routes.

High-profile logistics and transportation customers like fleet operator J.B. Hunt and retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc have also said they would give the Tesla Semi, unveiled on Nov. 16, a try. [nL1N1NM1N4] [nL3N1NN3V7]

The Semi, scheduled for rollout in 2019, is Tesla's next step to move the economy away from fossil fuels through electric cars, solar roofs and power storage.

DHL Supply Chain, which provides transportation, warehousing and distribution services for U.S. manufacturers and retailers, ordered 10 trucks to test at customer facilities in major U.S. cities, the company said in a statement.

"The trucks will be used for shuttle runs and same-day customer deliveries, and will be tested for fuel efficiency on longer runs from major markets to other DHL operations across the country," the company said.

Fortigo, based in Etobicoke, Ontario, ordered one truck, Chief Executive Elias Demangos said by email on Tuesday.

"We'll be running it in a pilot program to ensure it meets our business objectives," Demangos said.

Tesla will not provide a tally of orders it has received for the truck, company spokesman Dave Arnold said in an email.

The limited early orders reflect uncertainty about the market for electric commercial vehicles. The 500-mile (800 km) range between charges for the Tesla Semi is about half the range between fill-ups of a diesel Class 8 truck. Heavy batteries cut payload and add cost, potential deal killers for fleet buyers focused on operating cost per mile. [nL1N1NM1N4]

However, Tesla, and truck makers such as Daimler AG , Navistar International Corp and its partner Volkswagen AG are investing in electric models in a bet that the market will shift over the next decade.

Digital mapping company HERE to acquire ATS in connected-car play - Reuters News

{{20171128T163147.111+0000}}Digital mapping company HERE to acquire ATS in connected-car playLONDON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Digital mapping firm HERE said on Tuesday it plans to acquire Advanced Telematic Systems (ATS), a Germany-based company that provides "over the air" software updates for connected and autonomous vehicles.

The deal, whose terms were not disclosed and which should close in early 2018, would strengthen HERE's position as a provider of location and cloud services for self-driving cars that could hit the road in large numbers within a few years.

"The acquisition of ATS is a hugely important strategic investment for us to complement our portfolio as a premium automotive cloud provider," said Ralf Herrtwich, SVP Automotive of HERE Technologies.

HERE was itself sold to Nokia to Audi , BMW and Daimler in 2015 for more than $2 billion and functions as a research lab for the carmakers as they seek to counter the competitive threat from U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla .

Its mapping technology competes with Alphabet's Google Maps and Dutch rival TomTom .

HERE, the biggest provider of digital maps for the automotive industry, spent 640 million euros ($760 million) on research and development in 2016, or around 55 percent of its sales of 1.16 billion euros, according to documents reviewed by Reuters. http://reut.rs/2i0MTOJ

Over-the-air technology, or OTA, is in increasing demand as companies developing cars as digital devices and autonomous vehicles seek to keep their technology updated and user experience fresh.

It is similar to the way smartphones receive operating system and application updates over mobile networks, and has been pioneered by Tesla for updates to its car models. http://reut.rs/2zMLfeN

Security against hacker attacks is vital for such connected cars, and ATS's flagship product, OTA Plus v3, is supported by Uptane, a security framework that is being developed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

HERE says its plans for ATS's OTA technology includes both developing it as a standalone product and using it to boost other parts of its business that could also support secure map and software updates for other connected devices including drones. ($1 = 0.8420 euros)

COLUMN-Cobalt, the heart of darkness in the shiny electric vehicle story: Andy Home - 路透新闻

{{20171128T150706.035+0000}}COLUMN-Cobalt, the heart of darkness in the shiny electric vehicle story: Andy Home(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters)

By Andy Home

LONDON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - The electric vehicle (EV) story continues to gather momentum, with even major oil companies scrambling to join the coming green energy revolution.

Royal Dutch Shell has just announced a partnership with leading automotive companies to install super-fast chargers on European highways. [nL8N1NU2IF]

But as ever more companies sign up to the bright, shiny EV future, there is rising concern about the heart of darkness in this new technology -- you can't power an EV without a lithium-ion battery and, for now at least, you can't make a battery without using cobalt.

And most of the world's cobalt comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a country racked by political instability, legal opacity and, at its darkest, child labour in its mines.

This concentration of supply risk, both in terms of physical units and ethical sourcing, isn't going away any time soon and could even worsen.

THE DARK SIDE

The DRC accounted for 66,000 tonnes of global mined cobalt production of 123,000 tonnes last year, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.

That's the official sector. There is also an artisanal stream of production, some of it using child labour and some of it controlled by insurgent militias.

Quite how much cobalt this grey sector generates is the main "known unknown" in any analysis of world production.

But it is an undisputed fact that it has been seeping into the official supply chain for years.

Speaking at a London Metal Exchange (LME) seminar in October, Tony Southgate, head of cobalt marketing at Eurasian Resources Group, warned that "it's almost inevitable (...) there are mobile phones in this room" containing cobalt from child labour in the DRC.

The issue has moved to the top of the LME's own agenda after complaints that one of its registered brands, produced by China's Yantai Cash Industrial, could include metal sourced from the dark side of the DRC cobalt sector.

The LME has written to producers asking for assurances on ethical and socially responsible minerals sourcing, while Yantai told the Financial Times that it is conducting its own due diligence exercise.

LEGAL OPACITY

Child labour is only one of multiple problems posed by the DRC to the emergence of an efficient raw materials chain for commodities used in batteries.

The legal and financial framework around the country's mining sector is both opaque and tinged with political interference.

A recent study by U.S. advocacy group The Carter Center described state mining company Gecamines as operating a "parallel state" and concluded that $750 million from DRC's copper mine privatisation process cannot be tracked reliably.

Such allegations are vehemently denied by the DRC government, but legal controversy is never too far away in the DRC mining sector.

Glencore , one of the leading operators in the country, has been sucked into a controversy surrounding the role of Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler in the acquisition of assets now operated by its Katanga Mining subsidiary. [nL5N1GG1Y5]

Another operator, Groupe Forrest, is in legal dispute with Gecamines after the latter blocked access to its production site this year and awarded mining rights to another entity, Bloomberg reported.

This particular three-way court tussle is having a direct market impact because production at the site has been halted, taking about 5,000 tonnes of cobalt out of the supply equation this year.

THE FUTURE IS (DRC) COBALT

Frankly, if the rest of the world could, it would happily not source any cobalt from the DRC.

And the likes of Tesla and Apple are trying to do just that, working with potential future producers in Canada and the United States to create their own cobalt supply chains.

There is no shortage of junior miner contestants in this ethical cobalt beauty contest, but right now the DRC is the dominant producer. And it's going to remain so for the foreseeable future.

Six of the top 10 cobalt-producing assets last year were located in the DRC, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

In 2022 the number will rise to nine out of the top 10, it forecasts. ("Cobalt - Supercharged as supply chain risk increases")

Quite simply, unless someone works out how to engineer cobalt out of the lithium-ion battery, the world is going to need a lot more cobalt and it's still going to get most of it from the DRC.

DANGEROUS DEPENDENCY

This is a dangerously concentrated dependency, leaving a whole supply chain beholden to the political, legal and ethical uncertainties surrounding the DRC's mining sector.

The only comparison, S&P Global suggests, is a similar concentration of platinum production in South Africa.

When that country was roiled by a wave of industrial action in 2014, it translated into a 20 percent dent in global supply that year. At least there were above-ground platinum stocks to fill the supply gap.

Whether there would be sufficient inventory of cobalt to buffer the market against serious disruption in the DRC is a very moot point.

The arrival of automotive companies to this dysfunctional market could in theory be a game-changer if they stimulate more supply and force a collective industry move to responsible sourcing.

A template already exists in the form of the iTSCi programme aimed at improving transparency in the tin-tantalum-tungsten mining sector of central Africa, including particularly challenging operating environments such as Kivu Province in the DRC.

Right now, however, a company such as Volkswagen is still at the early stage of simply trying to secure enough units to deliver on its electrification promise.

Attempts to lock in future supply at prices below current levels have not yet yielded any tangible results. [nL8N1NX3G4]

VW and other automakers are learning, to quote Rebecca Gordon, head of technology metals at CRU, "the value of cobalt in the ground".

Investing at the mine site would be one way of simultaneously ensuring supply in outright tonnage terms and in socially acceptable terms.

Most car companies are still understandably wary of getting involved at such an upstream part of a supply chain, but if they don't, they will remain exposed to whatever happens in the heart of darkness that is the DRC.

RPT-PREVIEW-Automakers struggle with the future in Los Angeles - Reuters News

{{20171127T130001.007+0000}}RPT-PREVIEW-Automakers struggle with the future in Los Angeles(Repeating story originally published over the weekend)

By Joseph White

DETROIT, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Car manufacturers' attempts to square what U.S. consumers want against the clean vehicles regulators and investors demand will be on display in Los Angeles this week at an auto show that has moved away from calling itself just an auto show.

Automakers on Monday will begin previewing new models for the media at an event called AutoMobility LA, reflecting an emphasis on digital technology and new ways to get around, such as self-driving cars. On Friday, the Los Angeles Auto Show will open to the public for 10 days, attracting visitors from one of the world's most affluent and culturally influential metropolitan markets.

For now, self-driving cars are not ready for consumers, and sales of the battery-powered vehicles demanded by California regulators remain marginal and money-losing. Profits are generated by gasoline-fueled sport utility vehicles and trucks.

Automakers caught between the petroleum past and the digital future will send muddled messages.

Volkswagen AG will try to replace memories of the diesel emissions cheating scandal that tarnished its image with many California customers by promoting its $40 billion wave of electric vehicles. [nL8N1NN3IV]

In the next breath, the German automaker will tout its gasoline-fueled Audi A8 large luxury sedan, which can pilot itself under limited circumstances but is out of step with a market where buyers are switching to sport utility vehicles.

Rivals overshadowed by electric vehicle pioneer Tesla Inc are in a quandary, too. Despite a booming stock market, sales for luxury brands BMW, Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz and Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> Lexus are down for the first 10 months of 2017. [nL2N1N131G] [nL2N1MN0QW]

BMW AG is expected to roll out new versions of its i8 plug-in hybrid sports car. But for those not interested in electrification, the company will use the show to promote a high-performance version of its 5 Series sedan.

Tata Motors unit Jaguar Land Rover will accompany its new gasoline-powered Range Rover SVAutobiography, billed as the "pinnacle" of a lineup that already has models priced above $100,000, with its first plug-in hybrid Range Rovers.

At AutoMobility LA, auto and technology industry executives will debate how ride-sharing, self-driving vehicles and electric cars will shape the future. At the auto show itself, the stars will be gasoline-burning SUVs, such as the Subaru Ascent, a large, three-row SUV from a brand known for compact, all-wheel-drive cars.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV will unveil a new Jeep Wrangler with styling that still harks back to the trusty vehicles that helped the United States win World War Two.

UPDATE 4-ThyssenKrupp lifted by record orders as shifts from steel - Reuters News

{{20171123T181854.552+0000}}UPDATE 4-ThyssenKrupp lifted by record orders as shifts from steel* Highest order intake in 5 yrs at 44.29 bln euros

* Adjusted EBIT up 30 pct at 1.91 bln euros

* Expects adj EBIT of 1.8-2.0 bln euros in 2017/18

* Proposes unchanged dividend of 0.15 euro/share

* Shares close up nearly 4 pct

(Adds comments from shareholder Cevian to Handelsblatt)

By Christoph Steitz and Tom Käckenhoff

ESSEN, Germany, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Demand for next-generation lifts and car components enabled Thyssenkrupp to report its highest annual order intake in five years as the German firm slowly exits steelmaking.

Thyssenkrupp is in the middle of a major shift under Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger towards technology and away from the more volatile steel industry, its traditional mainstay.

It has sold its money-losing Brazilian steel mill CSA Cia Siderúrgica do Atlántico SA to Ternium SA and struck a deal to combine its European steel businesses with that of India's Tata Steel in 2018. [nL5N1M10F1] [nL1N1G7009]

"The structural problems in the European steel industry have not gone away. We still have significant overcapacities also on the European flat steel market," Hiesinger said on Thursday.

But labour representatives are demanding job protection for workers and say Thyssenkrupp is shirking responsibility for a business whose roots go back more than 200 years.

Hiesinger said he remained confident an agreement with workers can be found as thousands were expected to stage demonstrations at Thyssenkrupp's tin plate production site in Andernach, calling for job and plant guarantees.

"All conceivable alternatives would involve far greater job cuts," Hiesinger said, referring to 2,000 job losses that were already announced along with the joint venture in September.

Shareholder Cevian, which holds around 18 percent of Thyssenkrupp, described the results as concerning, saying management had set a target four years ago to achieve operating margins of 6-7 percent but was only making half that.

"The strategy has not yet delivered what was promised" Cevian co-founder Lars Foerberg told German daily Handelsblatt in an interview.

He said while the company had found a good solution for the steel division, it needed to look at finding the right structure for its other divisions to become more competitive.

"There are various options to find the right structure. A joint venture, decentralised company structure, spin-off. The main point is that old-style conglomerates don't work," he said.

The chief executive of Siemens also said earlier this month that he saw no future for old-school conglomerates. [nF9N17F03W]

CATCHING A LIFT

While slowly reducing its dependency on steel, Thyssenkrupp is staking its future on its elevators unit, its most profitable, as well as demand from the automotive sector, its biggest customer group accounting for about a quarter of sales.

ThyssenKrupp's order intake rose 18 percent to 44.29 billion euros ($52 billion) in the financial year to Sept. 30 while adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) reached 1.91 billion euros, beating the 1.73 billion expected by analysts in a Reuters poll.

Operating profit at its elevators unit, which mostly caters to clients in the United States and Europe with its internet-connected elevators, rose 7 percent to 922 million euros, making it the group's single biggest profit contributor.

At its components technology unit, which supplies parts to nine out of 10 premium cars, including all models of electric car maker Tesla , operating profit grew 12 percent to 377 million euros.

Shares in the group turned positive after sharp early falls, and closed up almost 4 percent. "The numbers came out better than feared, although the outlook could disappoint people a bit," said one trader.

Thyssenkrupp, which recommended an unchanged dividend of 0.15 euros per share, said it expects adjusted EBIT this year of 1.8-2.0 billion euros while analysts on average expect 2.03 billion euros. ($1 = 0.8462 euros)

UPDATE 4-ThyssenKrupp lifted by record orders as shifts from steel - 路透新闻

(Adds comments from shareholder Cevian to Handelsblatt)

By Christoph Steitz and Tom Käckenhoff

ESSEN, Germany, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Demand for next-generation lifts and car components enabled Thyssenkrupp to report its highest annual order intake in five years as the German firm slowly exits steelmaking.

Thyssenkrupp is in the middle of a major shift under Chief Executive Heinrich Hiesinger towards technology and away from the more volatile steel industry, its traditional mainstay.

It has sold its money-losing Brazilian steel mill CSA Cia Siderúrgica do Atlántico SA to Ternium SA and struck a deal to combine its European steel businesses with that of India's Tata Steel in 2018. [nL5N1M10F1] [nL1N1G7009]

"The structural problems in the European steel industry have not gone away. We still have significant overcapacities also on the European flat steel market," Hiesinger said on Thursday.

But labour representatives are demanding job protection for workers and say Thyssenkrupp is shirking responsibility for a business whose roots go back more than 200 years.

Hiesinger said he remained confident an agreement with workers can be found as thousands were expected to stage demonstrations at Thyssenkrupp's tin plate production site in Andernach, calling for job and plant guarantees.

"All conceivable alternatives would involve far greater job cuts," Hiesinger said, referring to 2,000 job losses that were already announced along with the joint venture in September.

Shareholder Cevian, which holds around 18 percent of Thyssenkrupp, described the results as concerning, saying management had set a target four years ago to achieve operating margins of 6-7 percent but was only making half that.

"The strategy has not yet delivered what was promised" Cevian co-founder Lars Foerberg told German daily Handelsblatt in an interview.

He said while the company had found a good solution for the steel division, it needed to look at finding the right structure for its other divisions to become more competitive.

"There are various options to find the right structure. A joint venture, decentralised company structure, spin-off. The main point is that old-style conglomerates don't work," he said.

Tesla cranks up big battery in Australia - Reuters News

{{20171123T030455.892+0000}}Tesla cranks up big battery in AustraliaMELBOURNE, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc has completed construction of the world's largest lithium ion battery in Australia, putting it on track to meet a 100-day deadline for switching the battery packs on, the South Australian government said on Thursday.

Tesla won a bid in July to build the 129 megawatt hour battery for South Australia, the country's most wind power-dependent state, with a vow from Chief Executive Elon Musk to install it within 100 days of signing a grid connection agreement or give it to the state for free. [nL4N1MA3KF]

When the grid connection deal was signed on Sept 29, Tesla was already half way through installing the battery packs.

The Tesla Powerpacks have now been fully installed at a wind farm run by France's Neoen, and testing is set to begin to provide grid security services in South Australia.

"While others are just talking, we are delivering our energy plan, making South Australia more self-sufficient, and providing back up power and more affordable energy for South Australians this summer," state Premier Jay Weatherill said in a statement.

The state has yet to say how much it would pay for the battery, which is part of a A$510 million ($390 million) plan that includes diesel-fired generators to help keep the lights on following a string of blackouts over the past 18 months.

Australia's energy market operator has warned that power supply will be tight this summer, particularly in South Australia and neighbouring Victoria, where one of the market's biggest coal-fired power plants was shut in March.

UPDATE 1-Norway's minority government wins backing for 2018 fiscal budget - Reuters News

{{20171122T185039.255+0000}}UPDATE 1-Norway's minority government wins backing for 2018 fiscal budget(Updates with confirmation, detail on dropped 'Tesla tax')

OSLO, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Norway's right-wing minority government reached a deal on Wednesday with two centrist parties for a 2018 budget, securing the plan's passage in parliament, the parties said.

The government of Conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Progress Party Finance Minister Siv Jensen relies on compromises with the opposition Christian Democrats and the Liberal Party to win backing for its policies.

"We are glad that we have reached an agreement on a budget that focuses on jobs," said Nikolai Astrup, the lead negotiator for the Conservatives, flanked by the negotiators for the other three parties.

The four parties scrapped a budget proposal to trim lavish tax breaks for Tesla and other electric cars, which have given the Nordic country the world's highest rate of battery-vehicle ownership.

The Christian Democrats and the Liberals are environmentally minded and the proposal, dubbed the "Tesla tax" in the Norwegian media, had stirred controversy after it was proposed.

The proposal in the draft budget would have mainly affected large cars weighing more than two tonnes, and was intended to scale back the favourable treatment of luxury models such as Tesla's Model X sport utility vehicle.

Norwegian media had estimated it could have pushed up the price of a Tesla Model X by 70,000 Norwegian crowns ($8,557.98).

India-based automaker Mahindra wants to sell electric vehicles in U.S. - Reuters News

{{20171120T220802.625+0000}}India-based automaker Mahindra wants to sell electric vehicles in U.S.By Paul Lienert

DETROIT, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd , one of India's oldest vehicle manufacturers, is testing autonomous tractors, trucks and cars, while moving closer to bringing electric vehicles to the United States, Chairman Anand Mahindra said on Monday.

The company, which opened a new North American headquarters north of Detroit on Monday, is considering when to begin U.S. sales of the vehicles, Anand Mahindra said in an interview.

It is also weighing whether the vehicles should carry the Mahindra brand or those of its affiliates Pininfarina, the famed Italian design house; and Ssangyong Motor Co <003620.KS>, a Korean manufacturer of utility and crossover vehicles, he added.

Mahindra & Mahindra bought Ssangyong in 2011 and Pininfarina in 2015. The Indian parent is collaborating with both companies on the development of electric vehicles, including premium models for Pininfarina that likely would compete with Tesla Inc . Anand Mahindra suggested that Ssangyong and Pininfarina electric vehicles might be sold in both the United States and China.

Earlier this year, Autocar India reported that Pininfarina was developing a family of electric vehicles for China's Hybrid Kinetic Group, as well as its own electric supercar. The magazine also reported that Ssangyong planned to launch an all-electric crossover vehicle in Korea in 2019.

In early November, Ssangyong said it had received approval to begin testing of autonomous vehicles in Korea, but did not say when it planned to produce them.

Anand Mahindra said his company, one of the world's largest tractor manufacturers, had been testing self-driving models since it bought a minority stake in Japan's Mitsubishi Agriculture Machinery in 2015. Mahindra & Mahindra operates several U.S. tractor assembly plants.

While work on the self-driving vehicles is still in the early stages, Mahindra & Mahindra has been building electric vehicles in India since the mid-1990s, when it developed a small fleet battery-powered, three-wheeled rickshaws for use in Delhi, the chairman said.

Mahindra & Mahindra bought Reva Electric Car Co, a small Bangalore-based manufacturer, in 2010 and transformed it into Mahindra Electric Mobility Ltd, which designs and builds compact electric vehicles for the Indian market.

In mid-September, the company renewed ties with Ford Motor Co through a new alliance that envisions sharing of technology, product development and parts sourcing, especially on electric vehicles.

The companies had a short-lived joint venture, Mahindra Ford India Ltd, established in 1995. Ford took control of the venture in 1998 and renamed it Ford India.

RPT-From Las Vegas to Washington D.C., lobbyists swarm U.S. Congress on tax bill - Reuters News

{{20171120T180001.247+0000}}RPT-From Las Vegas to Washington D.C., lobbyists swarm U.S. Congress on tax bill(Repeating without changes for wider distribution)

By Patrick Rucker and David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Recreational vehicle retailers from across the country were sipping morning coffee at a convention in Las Vegas earlier this month when word whipped through the hotel's "dealers' lounge" that the U.S. Congress was considering tax law changes threatening their businesses.

Republicans in the House of Representatives wanted to jettison a part of the tax code that lets dealers of RVs, cars, boats, even farm and construction machinery, write off all the interest expense of keeping inventories of vehicles on their sales lots.

The RV dealers jumped on the phones to their representatives in Washington, adding to a wave of calls made by members of the powerful National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) as well as lobbyists for boat dealers and farm machinery dealers.

"It's an eyedropper approach," said Phil Ingrassia, head of the RV dealers' trade group who marshaled their effort from the Bally's Hotel. "Just get heard."

By the end of the day, the crisis had passed, at least temporarily. The House had backed away from repealing the tax deduction for what dealers call floor-plan interest expense, or the financing costs they incur for vehicles on their lots, but they must still convince the Senate.

NADA, which represents more than 16,000 dealers nationwide, plans to send a letter on Monday to Senate Republican leaders, saying the group will not support a tax bill lacking the House language.

"The Senate business interest provision unfairly puts small businesses with high cost inventory at serious risk of paying higher taxes even when a business does not show a profit. NADA respectfully urges the Senate to include the language of H.R. 1, so that floor plan interest remains fully deductibility," said the letter from NADA President Peter Welch reviewed by Reuters.

Senate Republicans want to put broad limits on business interest deductibility, including dealer floor plan interest. Auto lobbyists did not convince the Senate Finance Committee to change the proposal before the panel approved it late Thursday, sending it on to the full Senate for consideration.

As Congress and President Donald Trump push ahead on what could be the largest tax overhaul since the 1980s, the crush of lobbyists descending on Washington, D.C., is a reminder that no legislation sweeps across American interests quite like a tax bill.

Floor plan interest deductibility has been part of the tax code since 1918. The deduction costs the U.S. Treasury about $300 million a decade which is not much relative to the $4 trillion annual federal budget, but Republicans are looking at every source of new federal revenues they can find to offset the costs of deep cuts they want to make in corporate tax rates.

Republicans also have raised questions about why interest costs paid by businesses in many forms is tax deductible at all, given it may encourage over-leveraging by business, and given corporations are not permitted a tax deduction for the costs of raising equity capital.

For lawmakers, such questions have to be weighed against aggressive lobbying exerted by groups defending their interests, such as the NADA, whose members employ over 1.1 million people selling cars from all major automakers, including General Motors Co , Volkswagen and Toyota <7203.T>.

Dealers argue that they have no choice but to pay significant interest costs to finance new vehicle inventory and would face higher costs if the provision is not changed.

FOREIGN AUTOMAKERS

Beyond the floor plan issue, the Electric Drive Transportation Association wants Congress to preserve a $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit.

A group of retired military leaders, including a former commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps and a former Navy secretary, sent a letter to Congress last week reviewed by Reuters urging lawmakers to keep the credit, but reform it. They suggest ending the credit in 2023, but lifting the existing 200,000 vehicle cap, a move that could help automakers like Tesla Inc and General Motors.

Foreign automakers such as Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> and Honda Motor Co <7267.T> are focused on a proposal that could increase taxes for foreign automakers that pay royalties, interest or other payments to their parent companies abroad.

The National Association of Home Builders wants a homeowners tax credit in the bill, especially if homeowners are only allowed to deduct the first $500,000 of their mortgage interest, as the House proposes. The association last week brought 100 builders from nationwide to fan out across Capitol Hill.

UPDATE 4-J.B. Hunt, Wal-Mart climb aboard Tesla's electric truck - Reuters News

{{20171117T213813.904+0000}}UPDATE 4-J.B. Hunt, Wal-Mart climb aboard Tesla's electric truck(Recasts throughout, adds context on regulatory pressure to cut diesel pollution)

By Arjun Panchadar and Eric M. Johnson

Nov 17 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Friday got high-profile orders from Wal-Mart Stores Inc and fleet operator J.B. Hunt for its future electric truck, but would-be customers indicated they are giving the big rig a try, not buying in volume.

Most of the customers who announced plans to put down $5,000 deposits for the Tesla Semi indicated they wanted to test a few of the vehicles. Wal-Mart said it plans to order a total of 15 Tesla trucks, five for the United States and ten for Canada. The company operates a fleet of about 6,000 trucks in the United States.

JB Hunt Transport Inc was the first major U.S. trucking company to announce an order for Tesla's new "Semi" electric trucks, saying it had reserved multiple vehicles for use on the U.S. West Coast. [nBw11VJ7Xa]

Hunt did not say how many of the vehicles it would reserve. Tesla unveiled the Semi on Thursday without specifying prices.[nL1N1NM1N4]

The early orders reflected the uncertainty about how the market for electric commercial vehicles will develop. About 260,000 Class-8 trucks are produced in North America annually, and that market has a value of about $28.6 billion, said Don Ake, vice president of commercial vehicles at FTR, an industry economics research firm.

The 500-mile (800 km) range between charges that Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk promised on Thursday for the Tesla Semi is about half the range between fill-ups of a diesel Class 8 truck. Heavy batteries cut payload and add cost, potential deal killers for fleet buyers focused on operating cost per mile. [nL1N1NM1N4]

However, Tesla, and incumbent truck makers such as Daimler AG , Navistar International Corp and its partner Volkswagen AG are investing in electric trucks in a bet that the market will shift over the next decade.

For global truck makers, the biggest market for electric trucks will likely be China, where the government is moving aggressively to convert the transportation system to electrified vehicles.

Regulators around the world are ratcheting up pressure on the trucking industry to slash emissions of soot and carbon dioxide from diesel trucks. In the United States, the government has estimated that heavy-duty trucks represent 4 percent of vehicles on the road but account for 20 percent of carbon emissions. Under President Barack Obama, the United States required truck makers to boost fuel efficiency through 2027.

Separately, some cities and ports are discussing banning or heavily taxing diesel vehicles. The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in Southern California have a goal of only having zero-emissions trucks by 2035. California is committing $140 million to subsidize low-carbon freight transportation.

Tesla has been trying to convince the trucking community that it can build an affordable electric big rig with the range and capacity to compete with relatively low-cost, time-tested diesel trucks.

It was not clear how many orders for Semis Tesla had in hand. Among companies announcing plans to acquire small numbers of Tesla trucks were Michigan retailer Meijer Inc [MEIJR.UL] and Canadian retail chain Loblaw , which has said it wants an entirely electric corporate vehicle fleet by 2030. [nL1N1NN1LM]

Some big logistics companies stayed on the sidelines. United Parcel Service Inc said the courier had nothing to announce regarding Tesla's vehicles but would always look for options that fit its needs.

Brad Pinchuk, chief executive of Dubuque, Iowa-based Hirschbach Motor Lines, said his firm was looking to test non-diesel big-rig options but needed longer ranges than Tesla could provide and speedier fuel-up times.

Pinchuk said he plans to buy two hydrogen-powered trucks made by Salt Lake City-based electric Nikola Motor Company when they are available in 2020.

"It's a different application – putting liquid hydrogen into tanks – so it will be very similar sort of situation to diesel," Pinchuk said. "You'd be able to fuel up. It would take about the same amount of time to fuel up a diesel and go about the same distance."

UPDATE 3-Tesla's unfettered ambition will drain finances -analysts - Reuters News

{{20171117T203245.877+0000}}UPDATE 3-Tesla's unfettered ambition will drain finances -analysts* Tesla likely to burn bulk of cash reserves by end-Q1

* May need to tap more skeptical debt markets

* Shares gain, but still down more than 20 pct from high

(Adds context on regulatory demands for cleaner trucks)

By Supantha Mukherjee

Nov 17 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc may have to ask creditors and shareholders for more capital to fund development of an electric semi truck, a new roadster and accelerated production of a high-volume electric sedan, analysts said on Friday.

Musk unveiled one flashy strategy for generating cash during the launch event Thursday for the Semi truck, surprising the audience with a prototype of a new generation of the Tesla Roadster. Musk promised the Roadster will be the fastest production car available. The first 1,000 cars will cost $250,000 each, paid in full upfront, with later models starting at $200,000. [nL1N1NM1N4]

Those deposits would put $250 million into Tesla's cash drawer today for a car that is likely to go into production in 2020.

Musk did not offer details about how Tesla would generate additional funds to deliver the semi truck and the roadster, and overcome production problems that have hobbled production of the company's high-volume sedan, the Model 3. [nL2N1N72DJ]

Tesla spent $1.1 billion on its auto business in the third quarter, and expects expenses of $1 billion in the current one. It had about $3.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents as of Sept. 30.

At the current cash-burn rate, it would likely be down to about $1 billion in cash by the end of the first quarter.

"In essence, all last night's event did was add to Elon Musk's shopping list of things he needs to spend money on at a time when the company is having difficulty making its base vehicle (Model 3)," said Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne.

Despite such concerns, Tesla shares were up about 1.4 percent at mid-day. While the shares are up more than 40 percent this year, they have fallen 20 percent from record highs in mid-September.

Shares in heavy truck diesel engine maker Cummins Inc fell 4.7 percent, and shares in Class-8 truck makers Paccar Inc and Navistar International Corp also fell.

Tesla this month pushed back its target for volume production on the Model 3 sedan - widely seen as crucial to the company's long-term future - by about three months to fix production bottlenecks. [nL1N1NM1N4] [nL2N1N72DJ]

Osborne said Tesla's cumulative capex announcements now exceed $15 billion to $20 billion over the next few years.

Some analysts fear the trucks will be an expensive distraction for the company, which has never posted an annual profit and is in self-described "manufacturing hell" related to the $35,000 Model 3 sedan.

Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois estimated that Tesla would need to raise $2.5 billion to $3 billion to keep production running smoothly.

"Longer term, we continue to think the capital intensity of the business model will keep returns below best-in-class auto(makers)," Houchois said in a research note.

Tesla's last debt sale in August was well-received in a hot bond market, allowing the company to increase the offering to $1.8 billion from $1.5 billion. But the bond has underperformed in the secondary market, suggesting it could be more challenging for Tesla to tap the high-yield debt market again so soon.

"They are losing $1.5 billion a quarter and the bond is unsecured so it is not of interest to me," said Jim Brilliant, chief investment officer at Century Management.

CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Tesla's unfettered ambition to drain finances - analysts - Reuters News

* Tesla likely to burn bulk of cash reserves by end-Q1

* May need to tap more skeptical debt markets

* Shares gain, but still down 20 pct since Sept. 18

By Supantha Mukherjee

Nov 17 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc will face further questions about how fast it is burning through its cash pile and how soon it will have to ask creditors and shareholders for more after it unveiled its latest electric vehicles.

Investors prodded Tesla's shares 2 percent higher in early trade in New York, shrugging off worries it was over-stretching itself with the new futuristic trucks and pricey sports car launched in a glitzy event in California on Thursday.

But Chief Executive Elon Musk did not offer details about how Tesla would fund these projects, leaving Wall Street analysts skeptical about the company's ability to ramp up production as it spends money at a quick clip.

Tesla spent $1.1 billion on its auto business in the third quarter, and expects expenses of $1 billion in the current one. It had about $3.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of Sept. 30.

At the current cash-burn rate, it would likely be down to about $1 billion in cash by the end of the first quarter.

"In essence, all last night's event did was add to Elon Musk's shopping list of things he needs to spend money on at a time when the company is having difficulty making its base vehicle (Model 3)," Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne.

Tesla this month pushed back its target for volume production on the Model 3 sedan - widely seen as crucial to the company's long-term future - by about three months to fix production bottlenecks. [nL1N1NM1N4] [nL2N1N72DJ]

Osborne said Tesla's cumulative capex announcements now exceed $15 billion to $20 billion over the next few years.

Some analysts fear the trucks will be an expensive distraction for the company, which has never posted an annual profit and is in self-described "manufacturing hell" related to the $35,000 Model 3 sedan.

Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois estimated that Tesla would need to raise $2.5 billion to $3 billion to keep production running smoothly.

"Longer term, we continue to think the capital intensity of the business model will keep returns below best-in-class auto(makers)," Houchois said in a research note.

Tesla's last debt sale in August was well received in a hot bond market, allowing the company to upsize the offering to $1.8 billion from $1.5 billion.

But the bond has underperformed in the secondary market since, suggesting it could be more challenging for Tesla to tap the high-yield debt market again so soon.

While shares in the company are up more than 40 percent this year, they have fallen 20 percent since hitting record highs in mid-September.

The Model 3 is expected to go into production in 2018, electric trucks in 2019. Production for the new Roadster sports car, a likely Ferrari rival, will start in 2020.

The first 1,000 Roadsters will cost $250,000 each, paid in full upfront, with later models starting at $200,000.

Houchois called the plan interesting, noting that it would help Tesla raise $250 million plus the $50,000 deposits on reservations.

FACTBOX-Automakers get serious about electric cars - Reuters News

{{20171117T170343.037+0000}}FACTBOX-Automakers get serious about electric carsNov 17 (Reuters) - Volkswagen's leaders on Friday approved a five-year spending plan that aims to further the German carmaker's goal of transforming itself into a leading force in electric cars.

Europe's largest carmaker by unit sales will spend more than 34 billion euros ($40 billion) on electric cars, autonomous driving and new mobility services by the end of 2022. [nL8N1NN3IV]

Several carmakers have unveiled plans to mass produce electric vehicles, spurred on by government crackdowns on engine emissions, falling battery costs and an increasing range of electric cars.

China has set strict quotas for electric and plug-in hybrid cars that come into effect from 2019. It has a target of 2 million so-called new-energy vehicle (NEV) sales by 2020 and has signalled that longer term it will phase out the sale of conventional petrol-engine cars.

Here are carmakers' plans for a technology that has only played a marginal role until now:

Tesla Motors Inc – Next year could be make or break for the Californian pure-play electric vehicle maker, which just launched its first mass-market car, the Model 3. The company made just 260 Model 3 sedans in the third quarter due to what it called production bottlenecks. It had planned to build more than 1,500. This month it pushed back its target for volume production by about three months, saying it was difficult to predict how long it would take to fix production bottlenecks. It now expects to build 5,000 Model 3s per week by late in the first quarter of 2018, instead of its original target date of December. [nL2N1N72DJ]

On Thursday, the Palo Alto-based company also unveiled a prototype electric big-rig truck, the Tesla Semi, which it expects to start producing in 2019, and showed off a Roadster electric sports car, which it said will be available in 2020. [nL1N1NM1N4]

Toyota <7203.T> - The Japanese carmaker says it wants all its vehicles to be zero emission by 2050. It has championed its hybrid Prius and has focused much of its efforts on hydrogen vehicle technology. But it says it is not "anti-EV" and is spending heavily on technologies such as the solid-state battery, which has the potential to cut the cost of making electric cars and which Toyota is racing to commercializes by the first half of the 2020s. [nL4N1N23K3]

VW Group – Spurred on by its diesel emissions crisis, Europe's biggest carmaker says it will roll out 80 new electric cars by 2025 across its group brands which include Skoda, SEAT and Audi. VW Group is aiming for 2-3 million electric vehicle sales by 2025. All its models will have electric versions by 2030. The first big test will be the I.D., VW's answer to Tesla's Model 3.

Renault-Nissan <7201.T> – The French-Japanese alliance so far leads the deployment of modern electric cars - 490,000 to date - thanks to the top-selling Nissan Leaf introduced in 2010 and Renault's Zoe subcompact launched two years later. Twelve new pure-electric models will be on the road by 2022 as the alliance seeks to defend its head-start. Nissan has sold 250,000 Leafs and is aiming for a fifth of its vehicles to be zero emission by 2020. But the group is also hedging its bets by developing the hybrid gasoline-electric Nissan Note e-Power. [nL5N1LW0TK]

General Motors – The U.S. automaker plans to launch a new family of electric vehicles in 2021 that will cost less to build and make a profit, Chief Executive Mary Barra told investors this week. She said GM aims to be selling a million electric vehicles a year by 2026, many of them in China. GM still makes most of its profits from selling big, gasoline powered trucks and SUVs to Americans. Its electric Chevrolet Bolt is seen as a serious contender for Tesla. [nL1N1NL0VD]

Ford – The U.S. automaker plans to invest $5 billion in electric vehicles by 2022 and introduce at least 13 electric or hybrid models worldwide in the next five years including a small SUV built in its home state of Michigan offering an estimated range of 300 miles on one charge. It is cutting spending on future internal combustion engines but still plans for a third of vehicles to have internal combustion engines by 2030 - the year some European governments have proposed banning petroleum-fueled cars. Ford has not given any electric vehicle production targets. [nL4N1ME3GX]

Daimler – The company is investing 10 billion euros in electric and hybrid technology and is preparing to launch the EQ electric car. It aims for 100,000 annual electric car sales by 2020. By 2022, Mercedes plans to offer an electric version of every model it sells, with a total of at least 50 electric or hybrid models for sale. The Smart brand will stop offering combustion-engined variants altogether in 2020. [nL5N1H622Z]

BMW – A pioneer in electric cars, BMW launched the i3 in 2013 but sales have been relatively low and management has wrestled with whether to go all-out on electrification. That changed in September when the German manufacturer vowed to achieve mass production by 2025 with 12 fully electric models, with a range of up to 700 kilometres. BMW aims to deliver 100,000 electric cars this year globally. [nL8N1LO3RS]

Fiat – CEO Sergio Marchionne was for years a vocal sceptic of electric cars and their high battery costs, once telling people not to buy the electric Fiat 500e because he was losing money on each car. But in July he told analysts he had "joined the rest of the crew", a change of heart driven partly by the diesel emissions crisis. For now, his most concrete plans involve Fiat Chrysler's luxury, low volume brand Maserati which he wants to be half electric by 2022. [nL1N1HY1A7]

Volvo Cars – All Volvo car models launched after 2019 will be electric or hybrids, the Chinese-owned premium manufacturer said in July, making it the first major traditional carmaker to set a date for phasing out vehicles powered solely by the internal combustion engine. [nL8N1JW0JU]

Electric cars not ready for mass production yet - Toyota chairman to Spiegel - Reuters News

{{20171117T170001.167+0000}}Electric cars not ready for mass production yet - Toyota chairman to SpiegelFRANKFURT, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Battery-powered cars are not ready for mass production yet, the chairman of Japan's Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> told a German magazine, adding that he did not see U.S. electric vehicle pioneer Tesla as a role model.

"Battery-powered cars with a long range are very expensive and it takes a long time to charge them," Takeshi Uchiyamada was quoted as saying by Der Spiegel. "Such cars do not fit in our program."

Toyota in September established a venture to develop electric vehicle technology with partner Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T>, seeking to catch up with rivals in an increasingly frenetic race to produce more battery-powered cars. [nL4N1M91ER]

Both automakers are somewhat behind their peers, with neither having a fully electric passenger car on the market yet. This contrasts with Tesla, which late on Thursday unveiled an electric heavy duty truck as well as a new roadster. [nL1N1NM1N4]

"Tesla is not our enemy and not our role model," Uchiyamada said. "I think it's the German manufacturers that rather see Tesla as a competitor."

BMW and Mercedes are betting they can mass produce new electric cars based on conventional vehicles, defying sceptics who say they will need more radical designs to head off the threat from Tesla and other start-up carmakers. [nL8N1MA166]

Uchiyamada said that Toyota was working on a new type of solid-state battery that is able to store more power and can be recharged much more quickly than current types.

"This technology will be a big development step. But that will still take time. We expect mass production in four to five years."

On Friday, Toyota and Suzuki Motor Corp <7269.T> said they had agreed to cooperate in selling electric vehicles in India from around 2020, aiming to give each other a leg up in emerging markets and in low-emission technology. [nL3N1NN3TG]

REUTERS SUMMIT-Pets or planes? Investors tout lesser-known bets for 2018 - 路透新闻

{{20171117T163021.623+0000}}REUTERS SUMMIT-Pets or planes? Investors tout lesser-known bets for 2018(For other news from Reuters Global Investment 2018 Outlook Summit, click http://www.reuters.com/summit/investment18)

By Jonathan Stempel

NEW YORK, Nov 17 (Reuters) - With U.S. stock prices near record highs and major economies worldwide on an upswing, top investment professionals are seeking out less familiar and less popular ways to invest.

At this week's Reuters Global Investment 2018 Outlook Summit in New York, London, Hong Kong and Singapore, many investors said equities look relatively costly, and a lack of fear may leave investors ill-positioned for when prices head south.

That, they said, justifies diversification.

For Thomas Kwan, chief investment officer of Hong Kong-based Harvest Global Investments, dogs, cats and other furry friends that people keep as pets is one pick of the litter.

He said people in China, whose population is 1.4 billion, are taking care of pets better, and will buy more from companies making products such as pet food than they once did.

"People have been getting more reluctant to have kids, or they want kids but they also want pets where they can find love," he said. "There's a margin in this type of product that can be much higher than in other products because the customers -- dogs and cats -- are really not that picky."

Beyond the earth-bound, Marc Lasry, the billionaire co-founder of Avenue Capital Group in New York and co-owner of the National Basketball Association's Milwaukee Bucks, is looking to the sky to buy.

Lasry, who buys "distressed" and other undervalued securities, said he is investing in older, short-haul planes such as the Airbus A320, as low fuel prices prompt carriers to lease planes longer rather than update aging fleets.

"We're willing to buy end-of-life planes," Lasry said. "You're able to generate very, very high rates of return. Think of an old car. A 20-year-old car, the value is $500. But you don't mind driving it because fuel is cheap."

Other investors are betting on things they believe should be cheap.

Glen Kacher, whose Light Street Capital Management hedge fund in Palo Alto, California was up 53 percent from January to October, said he is "shorting almost every retailer," betting their share prices will fall.

Kacher said many big retailers have failed to adapt to changing customer preferences.

He said some even lag the prototypical corner deli now using technology to let people buy their breakfast sandwiches and coffee in seconds with the tap of a finger.

"The retailing industry is going to be an apocalypse," he said, without identifying which retailers will go down in flames. "Anyone working in the consumer retailing industry ... should be training for a new job."

Jim Chanos, the president of Kynikos Associates LP in New York who was early to predict Enron Corp's 2001 downfall, is again breaking with the popular wisdom by going short against Elon Musk's electric carmaker Tesla Corp .

That bet has yet to work out well, but Chanos is unfazed.

"It's a future bankruptcy," he said, without providing a time frame. "If you just look at the cash flow, it's not a sustainable business model."

Mario Gabelli, the Wall Street legend who oversees Gamco Investors Inc and Gabelli mutual funds, has a more conventional forecast, expecting a flurry of mergers he called "global lovemaking" if the Republican-controlled White House and Congress cut corporate taxes.

But he foresees an "old-fashioned correction" at some point, pointing to recent power assertions by two young non-U.S. leaders: Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has purged some rivals, and Kim Jong Un, whose military arsenals in North Korea could destabilize the Korean peninsula and beyond.

"There's a 32-year-old in Saudi Arabia and a 32-year-old in Pyongyang," Gabelli said. "Something is going to go wrong." Kim is more widely believed to be 33.

TOP-THEMA-VW steckt mehr als 70 Milliarden Euro in saubere Autos - Reuters (German)

{{20171117T153151.722+0000}}TOP-THEMA-VW steckt mehr als 70 Milliarden Euro in saubere Autos(durchweg neu mit mehr Details)

* 34 Milliarden Euro allein für E-Mobilität und autonomes Fahren

* Liquidität soll dennoch 20 Milliarden Euro nicht unterschreiten

* Betriebsrat begrüßt Beschlüsse als Signal an die Belegschaft

- von Jan Schwartz und Andreas Cremer

Wolfsburg, 17. Nov (Reuters) - Volkswagen will nach 'Dieselgate' wieder in die Offensive kommen und in den nächsten fünf Jahren massiv in die Elektromobilität investieren. Um neuen Konkurrenten wie dem US-Konzern Tesla die Stirn zu bieten, sollen bis Ende 2022 mehr als 34 Milliarden Euro in E-Autos, autonomes Fahren und die Digitalisierung fließen, wie der Wolfsburger Konzern am Freitag ankündigte. Einschließlich der Investitionen in die weltweiten Standorte sowie weitere Projekte sind es sogar knapp 72 Milliarden Euro. Der Aufsichtsrat machte das Geld dafür locker. Damit seien die Voraussetzungen geschaffen, Volkswagen bis zum Jahr 2025 "zur weltweiten Nummer Eins in der Elektromobilität" zu machen, sagte Vorstandschef Matthias Müller.

Das Werk in Zwickau in Sachsen soll zu einem europäischen Standort für die Serienproduktion von Elektrofahrzeuge umgebaut werden. Um dafür Platz zu schaffen, werden die dort bislang gebauten Varianten der Modelle Passat und Golf in die schwächer ausgelasteten Werke in Emden und Wolfsburg verlagert.[nL8N1NK2HT]

Mit dem Fahrplan erhöht Volkswagen das Tempo im Vergleich zu den im September auf der Messe IAA vorgestellten Plänen. Damals waren bis zum Jahr 2030 mehr als 20 Milliarden Euro für den Aufbau der Elektromobilität angekündigt worden. Analysten halten das neue Programm für ehrgeizig. Wegen seiner Größe mit zwölf Marken sei der Konzern aber in der Lage, die Summe zu stemmen. "Das Erstaunliche ist, trotz 25 Milliarden Euro für Dieselgate reicht das Geld bei Volkswagen immer noch für Zukunftsinvestitionen", sagte Frank Schwope von der NordLB. "Bei anderen wäre es der Exitus gewesen."

Die Barmittel im Kerngeschäft - darauf schauen besonders die Ratingagenturen - sollen trotz der hohen Kosten die Marke von 20 Milliarden Euro im laufenden Jahr nicht unterschreiten. Dazu sieht sich der Konzern dank des starken Autogeschäfts und weltweit sprudelnder Einnahmen in der Lage. Zuletzt hatte Volkswagen im Automobilgeschäft eine Netto-Liquidität von 25,4 Milliarden Euro.

EIN SPAGAT

Volkswagen sei für den Wandel gut aufgestellt, betonte Müller. Er sagte, die Investitionen in die Elektromobilität sollten geschultert werden, ohne dabei die aktuellen Technologien und Fahrzeugprojekte zu vernachlässigen. "Denn damit verdienen wir auf absehbare Zeit unser Geld." Der Konzernchef zeigte sich überzeugt, dass der Spagat zwischen der herkömmlichen Verbrennungstechnologie und dem Aufbruch ins Zeitalter selbstfahrender Autos und neuer Mobilitätsdienste gelingen werde. Müller verwies dabei auf das noch in dem Konzern steckende Potenzial an Kostenvorteilen und Einsparungsmöglichkeiten.

Der Betriebsrat begrüßte den Investitionsplan als wichtiges Signal an die Belegschaft. "Volkswagen geht die Weichenstellungen für seine künftige Ausrichtung konsequent und mit hohem Tempo an", sagte Betriebsratschef Bernd Osterloh. Dabei würden die zehn deutschen Produktionsstandorte mit Milliardensummen gestärkt. Allein drei Milliarden Euro flössen ins Stammwerk in Wolfsburg. "Wir verteilen Produkte und Investitionen so, dass wir Beschäftigung sichern und dabei gleichzeitig betriebswirtschaftlich sinnvoll den maximalen Gewinn erzielen." Vorhandene Kapazitäten müssten dabei so gut wie möglich ausgelastet werden.

AUFSICHTSRATSCHEF: RAZZIA WAR KEIN THEMA

Die jüngsten Durchsuchungen durch Staatsanwälte und Steuerfahnder in Wolfsburg seien im Aufsichtsrat nicht besprochen worden, sagte Chefkontrolleur Hans Dieter Pötsch. Die Ermittler gehen der Frage nach, ob Volkswagen bei angeblich überhöhten Zahlungen an Osterloh zu wenig Steuern gezahlt hat. Der Konzern bestreitet dies und betont, die Regeln des Betriebsverfassungesetzes und des Steuerrechts einzuhalten. [nL8N1NL5Z5]

Wachsen will der weltgrößte Autokonzern in den kommenden Jahren vor allem in Brasilien, China, Russland und Nordamerika. Dort sowie auf dem Heimatmarkt in Europa wird das Geld verdient, das VW für neue Technologien benötigt, um den CO2-Austoß der Fahrzeuge zu reduzieren. Wenn das nicht gelingt, drohen sonst ab 2021 empfindlich Strafen der EU.[nL5N1NE6SW] Finanzvorstand Frank Witter dringt daher darauf, den Wandel zu Anbieter von Elektroautos "mit hoher Effizienz" voranzutreiben.

Bis 2025 sollen die Konzernmarken mehr als 80 neue Elektromodelle auf den Markt bringen, darunter rund 50 rein batteriebetriebene Fahrzeuge. Die Zahl soll danach weiter steigen. Spätestens 2030 will der Konzern mindestens jeweils eine Elektroversion seiner insgesamt 300 Fahrzeugmodelle anbieten. Um den Bedarf an Batterien zu decken, hat Volkswagen bereits eines der größten Beschaffungsprogramme in der Geschichte beschlossen.[nL5N1LS436]

Nicht in dem Fünf-Jahres-Plan enthalten sind die Investitionen der chinesischen Gemeinschaftsunternehmen. Diese finanzieren ihre Ausgaben in die Werke und Produkte aus eigenen Mitteln. Auch dort investiert VW massiv in Elektromobilität, um die staatlichen Vorgaben zu erfüllen.[nL8N1NM209]

BREAKINGVIEWS-Tesla takes crowdfunding to 250 mph - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20171117T142058.482+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Tesla takes crowdfunding to 250 mph(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Richard Beales

LONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Elon Musk has found a new way to help satisfy Tesla's unquenchable thirst for capital. The money-losing $53 billion electric carmaker unveiled a surprise new Roadster model while showing off a battery-powered truck. The flourish came with a financial twist: pre-orders for the first-edition supercar alone may raise $250 million up front.

Thursday's event provided some details of Musk's planned entrance into the electric road-haulage market: a truck with a 500-mile range at full load. Already some analysts see the big rig as a distraction from what Musk himself has called the "manufacturing hell" of getting production of the company's Model 3 sedan anywhere near the eventually anticipated 500,000-plus a year.

The Roadster, which Musk said would hit the road in 2020, a year after the truck, only adds to the company's ambitious plans. Moreover, they all cost more money for a carmaker that is already burning through well over $1 billion of cash per quarter.

Tesla in August sold $1.8 billion of junk bonds at a 5.3 percent coupon, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in an offering boosted from an initially planned $1.5 billion. At an enterprise value well over 100 times analysts' average estimate of 2017 EBITDA, according to Thomson Reuters data, Tesla stock is pricey enough to issue more, too. Despite a recent slide of more than 10 percent it's still up 46 percent this year.

Down-payments for cars that won't be delivered for years are, however, a handy source of cost-free working capital. The 1,000 special "Founders Series" Roadsters, if all pre-ordered right away, would only bring in enough to cover about three weeks of cash burn at the 2017 pace to date. Orders for the regular version of the sports car, with a $50,000 reservation fee, could further add to Tesla's pot – with $686 million of customer deposits already on its balance sheet at the end of September.

The bonds issued in August have traded down and now yield around 6 percent. Wannabe early adopters of the lightning-fast new Roadster – which Musk says will accelerate from zero to 60 mph in less than 2 seconds and be able to drive 620 miles before recharging – might be rich and eager enough to let the entrepreneur have their money with no such return. If so, he will have succeeded in taking crowdfunding to 250 mph.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Tesla on Nov. 16 unveiled a new Roadster model, upstaging its own debut of an electric heavy-duty truck, the Semi. Chief Executive Elon Musk said the new $200,000 sports car would be the fastest production car ever.

- Reservations for the new model require a $50,000 payment, according to Tesla's website, but an initial 1,000 "Founders Series" cars will cost $250,000, to be paid in full up front.

- Musk did not give a price for the truck, or say how or where either product would be built, but he said the Semi would begin production in 2019 and that the Roadster would be available a year later.

- Some analysts fear the truck will be an expensive distraction for Tesla, which is burning cash, has never posted an annual profit, and is in self-described "manufacturing hell" starting up production of its $35,000 Model 3 sedan.

UPDATE 4-J.B. Hunt, Wal-Mart climb aboard Tesla's electric truck - 路透新闻

{{20171117T131848.000+0000}}UPDATE 4-J.B. Hunt, Wal-Mart climb aboard Tesla's electric truckNov 17 (Reuters)

(Recasts throughout, adds context on regulatory pressure to cut diesel pollution)

By Arjun Panchadar and Eric M. Johnson

Nov 17 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Friday got high-profile orders from Wal-Mart Stores Inc and fleet operator J.B. Hunt for its future electric truck, but would-be customers indicated they are giving the big rig a try, not buying in volume.

Most of the customers who announced plans to put down $5,000 deposits for the Tesla Semi indicated they wanted to test a few of the vehicles. Wal-Mart said it plans to order a total of 15 Tesla trucks, five for the United States and ten for Canada. The company operates a fleet of about 6,000 trucks in the United States.

JB Hunt Transport Inc was the first major U.S. trucking company to announce an order for Tesla's new "Semi" electric trucks, saying it had reserved multiple vehicles for use on the U.S. West Coast. [nBw11VJ7Xa]

Hunt did not say how many of the vehicles it would reserve. Tesla unveiled the Semi on Thursday without specifying prices.[nL1N1NM1N4]

The early orders reflected the uncertainty about how the market for electric commercial vehicles will develop. About 260,000 Class-8 trucks are produced in North America annually, and that market has a value of about $28.6 billion, said Don Ake, vice president of commercial vehicles at FTR, an industry economics research firm.

The 500-mile (800 km) range between charges that Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk promised on Thursday for the Tesla Semi is about half the range between fill-ups of a diesel Class 8 truck.

However, Tesla, and incumbent truck makers such as Daimler AG , Navistar International Corp and its partner Volkswagen AG are investing in electric trucks in a bet that the market will shift over the next decade.

For global truck makers, the biggest market for electric trucks will likely be China, where the government is moving aggressively to convert the transportation system to electrified vehicles.

Regulators around the world are ratcheting up pressure on the trucking industry to slash emissions of soot and carbon dioxide from diesel trucks. In the United States, the government has estimated that heavy-duty trucks represent 4 percent of vehicles on the road but account for 20 percent of carbon emissions. Under President Barack Obama, the United States required truck makers to boost fuel efficiency through 2027.

Separately, some cities and ports are discussing banning or heavily taxing diesel vehicles. The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in Southern California have a goal of only having zero-emissions trucks by 2035. California is committing $140 million to subsidize low-carbon freight transportation.

Tesla has been trying to convince the trucking community that it can build an affordable electric big rig with the range and capacity to compete with relatively low-cost, time-tested diesel trucks.

It was not clear how many orders for Semis Tesla had in hand. Among companies announcing plans to acquire small numbers of Tesla trucks were Michigan retailer Meijer Inc [MEIJR.UL] and Canadian retail chain Loblaw , which has said it wants an entirely electric corporate vehicle fleet by 2030. [nL1N1NN1LM]

Some big logistics companies stayed on the sidelines. United Parcel Service Inc said the courier had nothing to announce regarding Tesla's vehicles but would always look for options that fit its needs.

Brad Pinchuk, chief executive of Dubuque, Iowa-based Hirschbach Motor Lines, said his firm was looking to test non-diesel big-rig options but needed longer ranges than Tesla could provide and speedier fuel-up times.

Pinchuk said he plans to buy two hydrogen-powered trucks made by Salt Lake City-based electric Nikola Motor Company when they are available in 2020.

"It's a different application – putting liquid hydrogen into tanks – so it will be very similar sort of situation to diesel," Pinchuk said. "You'd be able to fuel up. It would take about the same amount of time to fuel up a diesel and go about the same distance."

Tesla's unfettered ambition to strain finances but investors unfazed - Reuters News

{{20171117T130519.496+0000}}Tesla's unfettered ambition to strain finances but investors unfazedBy Supantha Mukherjee

Nov 17 (Reuters) - Investors shrugged off any concern over Tesla Inc over-stretching its production and financial resources with the unveiling of new futuristic semi-trucks and a pricey sports car, pushing its shares up almost 4 percent on Friday.

Chief Executive Elon Musk shocked industry-watchers by launching a $200,000 sports car on Thursday, along with two electric trucks, possibly adding more logistical nightmares even as it wrestles with production issues related to its Model 3 sedan.

"In essence, all last night's event did was add to Elon Musk's shopping list of things he needs to spend money on at a time when the company is having difficulty making its base vehicle (Model 3)," Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne.

The company this month pushed back its target for volume production on the Model 3 by about three months to fix production bottlenecks. [nL1N1NM1N4] [nL2N1N72DJ]

Osborne said the company's cumulative capex announcements now exceed $15 billion to $20 billion over the next few years.

Some analysts fear the trucks will be an expensive distraction for Tesla, which is burning cash, has never posted an annual profit, and is in self-described "manufacturing hell" related to the $35,000 Model 3 sedan.

Tesla's ambitious plans would need a steady flow of cash, analysts said.

Jefferies analyst Philippe Houchois estimated that Tesla would need to raise $2.5 billion to $3 billion to keep production running smoothly.

"Longer term, we continue to think the capital intensity of the business model will keep returns below best-in-class auto OEMs," Houchois said in a research note.

Tesla spent $1.1 billion on its auto business in the third quarter and expects expenses of $1 billion in the current one.

The company had about $3.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents for the period ended Sept. 30. The company raised $1.8 billion by selling debt in August.

Although Tesla has made inroads among luxury car buyers with its Model S sedan and Model X SUV, it is the Model 3 on which the company's long-term success rests.

The Model 3 sedan is expected to go into production in 2018, electric trucks in 2019. Production for the new Roadster sports car, a likely Ferrari rival, will start in 2020.

The first 1,000 Roadsters will cost $250,000 each, paid in full upfront, with later models starting at $200,000.

Houchois called the plan interesting, noting that it would help Tesla raise $250 million plus the $50,000 deposits on reservations.

But the plan to make the trucks is likely to open up new growth areas for Tesla as the global race heats up to overcome the challenges of substituting batteries for diesel engines.

The company faces competition from the likes of Daimler AG , Navistar International Corp and Volkswagen AG , as well as a host of start-ups.

FOKUS 1-Tesla greift mit Elektro-Truck und erneuertem Roadster an - Reuters (German)

{{20171117T123709.065+0000}}FOKUS 1-Tesla greift mit Elektro-Truck und erneuertem Roadster an(Neu: Details zum Lkw, Branchenhintergrund)

* Musk: Tesla E-Truck günstiger als Diesel-Lkw

* Kaufpreis und Ladekapazitäten unbekannt

* Tesla stellt neuen Super-Sportwagen vor

Hawthorne/Los Angeles, 17. Nov (Reuters) - Der Elektroauto-Pionier Tesla will den traditionellen Herstellern wie Daimler jetzt auch bei Nutzfahrzeugen das Wasser abgraben. Umjubelt von seinen Anhängern stellte Tesla-Chef Elon Musk am Donnerstagabend (Ortszeit) in Los Angeles das mit Spannung erwartete vollelektrische Schwerlaster-Modell Tesla Semi vor. Die Gesamtkosten pro Meile - Kaufpreis einschließlich Stromverbrauch, Versicherung und Wartung - seien bei einem Diesel-Lkw 20 Prozent höher als beim Tesla-Laster, erklärte Musk. Wichtige Details wie den Kaufpreis und die Ladekapazität des Herausforderers von Freightliner, der führenden US-Marke von Platzhirsch Daimler, blieb Musk jedoch schuldig. Auch blieb offen, wo der für 2019 geplante Elektrotruck gebaut werden soll.

Daimler oder MAN arbeiten schon länger an Elektrolastwagen, allerdings maximal bis 26 Tonnen Gewicht. Die Serienproduktion des mittelschweren E-Lasters plant Mercedes-Benz für 2020. MAN will 2021 elektrische Lkw für den Stadtverkehr in größeren Stückzahlen bauen. 40-Tonner mit Stromantrieb wären den Herstellern zufolge dagegen noch viel teurer als Diesel-Lkw, denn es müssten sehr große Batterien eingebaut werden, die schwer sind und den Laderaum verkleinern. Zudem sind die Reichweiten derzeit vielen Kunden zu gering - steht ein Lkw oft, etwa zum Aufladen, häufen sich auch die Kosten. Und Speditionen rechnen mit sehr spitzem Bleistift. "Elektromobilität ist für den innerstädtischen Verteilerverkehr vorstellbar", sagt Branchenexperte Wolfgang Bernhart von Roland Berger. "Für Langstrecken-Lkw sehe ich das nicht."

FUTURISTISCHES DESIGN

Der Tesla Semi könnte beim zulässigen Gesamtgewicht von rund 36 Tonnen und Durchschnittstempo auf der Autobahn 500 Meilen (800 Kilometer) am Stück schaffen, erklärte Musk. Die Batterie könne innerhalb von 30 Minuten Strom für 400 Meilen Reichweite laden, während gleichzeitig die Ladung gelöscht werde. Der Tesla-Brummi hebt sich mit einer windschnittigen Fahrerkabine vom Design her von der Konkurrenz ab. Der Fahrer sitzt in der Mitte, flankiert von großen Bildschirmen an jeder Seite. Großflächige Scheiben ermöglichen weiten Rundumblick.

Analysten fürchten unterdessen, Tesla könnte sich mit dem Projekt übernehmen, da der defizitäre Autobauer derzeit schon Schwierigkeiten mit der Massenproduktion des Alltagswagens Model 3 hat. George Galliers vom Analysehaus Evercore ISI schrieb: "Es besteht das Risiko, dass die Produkte das Management vom überaus wichtigen Model 3 ablenken." Karl Brauer, Herausgeber von "Autotrader", kommentierte die Show mit den Worten: "Elons Effekthascherei bleibt intakt, auch wenn die Geduld der Model-3-Kunden schwindet." Tesla könnte auch bei den Nutzfahrzeugen ein Spitzenprodukt anbieten - vorausgesetzt, sie könnten auch produziert und verkauft werden. "Letzteres lässt Tesla Motors im Unklaren, das macht es schwer, darin mehr zu sehen als ein Was-wäre-wenn-Konzeptauto." Bei den Anlegern kamen Musks Pläne indes gut an: Der Aktienkurs stieg vor Börsenbeginn um gut zwei Prozent.

Die Show gestohlen hat dem matt in Silbermetallic lackierten Truck ohnehin seine überraschende Fracht: Zumindest der neu überarbeitete Sportwagen Tesla Roadster passt in den Laderaum und rollte von der Rampe. Die ersten 1000 Autos des Modells, das für 2020 angekündigt ist, sollen 250.000 Dollar kosten, danach sinkt der Preis auf 200.000 Dollar. Der feuerrot gespritzte Flitzer stelle neue Rekorde auf, betonte Musk: eine Reichweite von 1000 Kilometern und eine Beschleunigung von Null auf 100 Stundenkilometern in 1,9 Sekunden sowie mehr als 400 Stundenkilometer Spitzengeschwindigkeit. Im Vergleich dazu werde ein Sportwagen mit Benzin wie eine Dampfmaschine wirken, spottete der Tesla-Chef.

UPDATE 7-New $200,000 Tesla Roadster speeds in front of electric big-rig truck - Reuters News

{{20171117T070418.043+0000}}UPDATE 7-New $200,000 Tesla Roadster speeds in front of electric big-rig truck(Adds details of truck plans)

By Alexandria Sage

HAWTHORNE, Calif., Nov 16 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc upstaged its own debut of an electric heavy duty truck on Thursday when a red Roadster pulled out of the big rig's trailer and Chief Executive Elon Musk said the new $200,000 sports car would be the fastest production car ever.

The showmanship wowed the crowd although some analysts' heads started throbbing at the variety of new projects launched as the company is struggling to produce the more affordable sedan upon which its future depends.

As the presentation appeared to end, the Tesla Semi opened its trailer, and the Roadster drove out. The sports car with a removable glass roof is an updated version of Tesla's first production vehicle. It can seat four and travel 620 miles (1,000 km) on a single charge, a new record for an electric vehicle, Musk said. It can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour (100 km per hour) in 1.9 seconds with a maximum speed over 250 mph, which would make it the fastest car in general production.

"You'll be able to travel from LA to San Francisco, and back, at highway speed without recharging. The point of doing this is to just give a hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars. Driving a gasoline sports car is going to feel like a steam engine with a side of quiche," Musk boasted.

The first 1,000 cars will cost $250,000 each, paid in full up front, with later models starting at $200,000.

Musk did not give a price for the Semi, or say how or where either product would be built, but he said the truck would begin production in 2019 and that the Roadster would be available a year later.

PROJECTS AND PRODUCTS MULTIPLY

Musk has described electric trucks as Tesla's next effort to move the economy away from fossil fuels through projects including electric cars, solar roofs and power storage.

Some analysts fear the truck will be an expensive distraction for Tesla, which is burning cash, has never posted an annual profit, and is in self-described "manufacturing hell" starting up production of the $35,000 Model 3 sedan. [nL2N1N72DJ]

"Elon's showmanship remains intact, even as his customers' patience for Model 3 delivery wanes," Karl Brauer, executive publisher of Kelley Blue Book and Autotrader, said by email.

"The specs on the new semi truck and sports car would put both vehicles at the top of their segments...assuming they can be produced and sold as part of a sustainable business plan. So far that final element has eluded Tesla Motors, which makes it difficult to see these vehicles as more than 'what if' concept cars," he added.

Tesla also has to convince the trucking community that it can build an affordable electric big rig with the range and cargo capacity to compete with relatively low-cost, time-tested diesel trucks. The heavy batteries eat into the weight of cargo an electric truck can haul.

The truck can go up to 500 miles (800 km) at maximum weight at highway speed, Musk said, without giving the size of the payload. Musk said the Class 8 vehicle, the heaviest weight classification for trucks, in 30 minutes can recharge the battery enough to go 400 miles, and that Tesla would build a global, solar-powered network of "megachargers."

Diesel trucks are capable of traveling up to 1,000 miles (1,600 km) on a single tank of fuel. Musk said diesel trucks were 20 percent more expensive per mile to operate than his electric truck.

Self-driving technology would allow the trucks to travel in convoys, where only the front truck would need a driver, making trucks cheaper than rail, Musk added.

That vision, however, faces an uncertain regulatory future, since Congress is considering exempting heavy duty trucks from looser self-driving rules in the works, after truckers lobbied that safety and millions of jobs could be at risk.

The day cab - which is not a sleeper - has a less prominent nose than on a classic truck, and the battery is built into the chassis. Tesla designed the cab for good visibility, with a center seat flanked by two touch screens.

Tesla showed off the semi on a webcast which offered reservations for the truck at $5,000 each, but Musk did not discuss reservation volume.

Old Dominion Freight Line Inc , the fourth-largest U.S. less-than-truckload carrier, which consolidates smaller freight loads onto a single truck, said it was not signing on.

"We met with Tesla and at this time we do not see a fit with their product and our fleet," Dave Bates, senior vice president of operations, said in an email, without elaborating.

Tesla faces a much more crowded field for electric trucks than it did when it introduced its electric cars.

Manufacturers such as Daimler AG , Navistar International Corp and Volkswagen AG are joining a host of start-ups racing to overcome the challenges of substituting batteries for diesel engines as regulators crack down on carbon dioxide and soot pollution.

Still, manufacturers are mostly focused on medium-duty trucks, not the heavy big rig market Tesla is after.

Tesla would need to invest substantially to create a factory for those trucks. The company is currently spending about $1 billion per quarter, largely to set up the Model 3 factory, and is contemplating a factory in China to build cars.

Charging and maintaining electric trucks that crisscross the country could be expensive and complex.

Shares of Tesla have risen 46 percent this year to make the company the No. 2 U.S. automaker by market value.

Tesla greift mit neuem Elektro-Truck und verbessertem Roadster an - Reuters (German)

{{20171117T064502.230+0000}}Tesla greift mit neuem Elektro-Truck und verbessertem Roadster anHawthorne, 17. Nov (Reuters) - Der Elektroauto-Pionier Tesla nimmt jetzt auch den Lastwagen-Markt ins Visier. Das kalifornische Unternehmen stellte einen Prototyp für einen E-Truck vor, der ab 2019 gefertigt werden soll. Gleichzeitig präsentierte Tesla-Chef Elon Musk am Donnerstag in Los Angeles einen neuen Roadster vor, der eine modernisierte Form des ersten Tesla-Autos darstellen soll.

Der Truck mit der Bezeichnung Tesla Semi soll Musk zufolge bei voller Beladung und Autobahn-Geschwindigkeit eine Reichweite von 800 Kilometern haben. Diesel-Lkw schaffen mit einer Tankladung etwa die doppelte Strecke. Einen Preis für den Truck nannte Tesla nicht. Der geplante Roadster bietet nach Angaben des kalifornischen Unternehmens Platz für vier Insassen und kann mit einer Batterieladung rund 1000 Kilometer zurückgelegen. Dies wäre ein neuer Rekord für ein E-Auto. Der Wagen kann Musk zufolge zudem in 1,9 Sekunden auf 100 Kilometer pro Stunde beschleunigen. Die ersten 1000 Autos sollen 250.000 Dollar kosten, danach sinkt der Preis auf 200.000 Dollar.

Tesla hatte zuletzt mit Produktionsschwierigkeiten bei seinem Model 3 zu kämpfen. Wegen verschiedener Engpässe kommt das Unternehmen mit der Produktion nicht hinterher. Der Tesla 3 gilt als Hoffnungsträger des Unternehmens, weil er mit 35.000 Dollar nur halb so viel wie das Flagschiff S kostet.

Tesla to unveil electric big-rig truck in midst of Model 3 factory 'hell' - Reuters News

{{20171116T120000.983+0000}}Tesla to unveil electric big-rig truck in midst of Model 3 factory 'hell'By Alexandria Sage

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Thursday will unveil a prototype electric big-rig truck, which may be able to drive itself, throwing the company into a new market even as it struggles to roll out an affordable sedan which is central to the company's future.

Chief Executive Elon Musk has described electric trucks as Tesla's next effort to move the economy away from fossil fuels through projects including electric cars, solar roofs and power storage.

But some analysts fear the truck, named Tesla Semi, will be an expensive distraction for Tesla, which is burning cash, has never posted an annual profit, and is in self-described "manufacturing hell" starting up production of the $35,000 Model 3 sedan. [nL2N1N72DJ]

The young market for electric cargo trucks is mostly focused on medium duty, rather than the heavy big rig market Tesla is after. The power capacity, weight and cost of batteries all limit a truck's ability, analysts say.

Reuters in August reported that Tesla was working on self-driving technology for the truck. Several Silicon Valley companies see long-haul trucking as a prime early market for the self-driving technology, citing the relatively consistent speeds and little cross-traffic trucks face on interstate highways and the benefits of allowing drivers to rest while trucks travel. [nL1N1KV1X5]

The truck would have a working range of 200 to 300 miles (320 to 480 km), at the low end of what is considered "long-haul" trucking, Reuters reported. [nL2N1LA0XJ] Diesel trucks are capable of traveling up to 1,000 miles (1,600 km) on a single tank of fuel.

Musk, who has pushed back the debut twice, said this week that the truck would "blow your mind clear out of your skull" when it was introduced in a webcast on Thursday at 8 p.m. PST (0400 GMT Friday).

"Semi specs are better than anything I've seen reported so far. Semi eng/design team work is aces, but other needs are greater right now," Musk tweeted in October, announcing the second delay.

"It can transform into a robot, fight aliens and make one hell of a latte," he added on Wednesday, posting a picture of a backlit, shadowed Semi with trapezoidal blue headlights. He has forecast large-scale production within a couple of years.

A Tesla truck with a range of 300 to 450 miles would be able to address less than half of the total semi-truck market, estimated Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi in a note on Monday.

"It is somewhat unclear why the company needs another major initiative ... on its already full plate," wrote Sacconaghi.

Volkswagen steckt in China zehn Milliarden Euro in Elektroautos - Reuters (German)

{{20171116T085552.221+0000}}Volkswagen steckt in China zehn Milliarden Euro in ElektroautosGuangzhou, 16. Nov (Reuters) - Volkswagen investiert in China massiv in neue Elektroautos, um die staatlich verordnete Quote zu erfüllen. In den nächsten sieben Jahren werde der Konzern auf dem weltgrößten Automarkt zehn Milliarden Euro in die Entwicklung neuer, batteriebetriebener Autos und Hybridfahrzeugen stecken, kündigte China-Chef Jochem Heizmann am Donnerstag vor der Automesse in Guangzhu an. Davon sollen allein in den nächsten zwei bis drei Jahren 15 Modelle auf den Markt kommen, weitere 25 seien bis zum Jahr 2025 geplant. Alle Autobauer stecken derzeit viel Geld in die Entwicklung so genannter New Energy Vehicles, um die von China ab 2019 verlangte Quote für Elektroautos einzuhalten.

Um das zu schaffen, will Volkswagen den Verkauf von E-Mobilen bis 2020 auf jährlich 400.000 Stück hochschrauben, fünf Jahre später sollen es 1,5 Millionen im Jahr sein. Die Fahrzeuge sollen eine Reichweite zwischen 400 und 600 Kilometern haben. Zum Vergleich: Das Flaggschiff Model S des US-Elektroautobauers Tesla kommt mit einer Batterieladung fast 500 Kilometer weit und kann je nach Akku-Kapazität sogar mehr als 600 Kilometer schaffen.

Heizmann zeigte sich zuversichtlich, dass Volkswagen die staatlich verordnete Elektroauto-Quote zusammen mit seinen Partnern erfüllen werde. Diese sieht vor, dass 2019 zehn Prozent des Jahresabsatzes der Hersteller aus E- und Hybrid-Fahrzeugen bestehen. 2020 soll diese Quote auf zwölf Prozent steigen. Verfehlen Hersteller die Hürde, müssen sie Kreditpunkte erwerben. Der US-Autobauer General Motors hatte vergangene Woche angekündigt, er werde die Vorgaben mindestens erreichen, wenn nicht sogar übertreffen.

CORRECTED-UPDATE 3-GM challenges Tesla with promise of profitable electric cars  - Reuters News

{{20171115T190117.951+0000}}CORRECTED-UPDATE 3-GM challenges Tesla with promise of profitable electric cars (Corrects to remove reference to 2021 as the date in which GM plans to put a shared autonomous vehicle into commercial service in 14th paragraph)

By Paul Lienert and Nick Carey

Nov 15 (Reuters) - General Motors Co plans to launch a new family of electric vehicles in 2021 that will cost less to build and make a profit for the U.S. No. 1 automaker, Chief Executive Mary Barra told investors on Wednesday.

Her plans represent a direct challenge to money-losing electric vehicle specialist Tesla Inc , which is struggling to get its more affordable, high-volume Model 3 launched and recently reported its largest-ever quarterly loss. [nL2N1N72DJ]

"We are committed to a future electric vehicle portfolio that will be profitable," Barra said at the Barclays Global Automotive Conference in New York.

Electric and autonomous vehicles - known in the industry as EVs and AVs - are widely seen as the keystones of future transport, but Tesla, Ford Motor Co and other manufacturers are still working out how to make money on them.

GM is looking to break out of that pattern by developing an all-new electric vehicle platform that will accommodate multiple sizes and segments, to be sold by different GM brands in the United States and China, Barra said, adding new details to GM's aggressive electrification strategy.

In early October, GM said it planned to launch 20 new electric vehicles by 2023, but did not provide specifics. [nL2N1MD1YS]

In comparison, rival Ford has said it plans to introduce 13 "electrified" vehicles - mostly hybrid gasoline-electric models - by 2022. [nL4N1ME3GX]

GM's shares were down 0.4 percent at $42.84 in midday trade. Tesla and Ford shares were also down slightly in a broadly lower market.

CHEAPER BATTERY

Barra said GM aims to be selling 1 million electric vehicles a year by 2026, many of them in China, which has set strict production quotas on such vehicles. On Monday, GM's China chief said the automaker and its joint-venture partners will be able to meet the country's 2019 electric vehicle requirements without purchasing credits from other companies. [nL3N1NJ344]

GM's cost reduction efforts on electric vehicles center on a new battery system that will be more than 30 percent cheaper than the one that powers the Chevrolet Bolt.

The company aims to cut the cost of its lithium-ion batteries to less than $100 per kilowatt-hour from $145 per kilowatt-hour by 2021, which would bring the overall cost of electric vehicles much closer to comparable gasoline-engine models.

GM said the new batteries would hold more energy and charge quicker. The company is aiming to boost electric vehicle range to more than 300 miles (483 km) with the new batteries. The current Bolt is rated at 238 miles between charges.

Barra said GM will have the ability to manufacture high volumes of the new batteries at plants in the United States and China. She said GM projects sales of 1 million electric vehicles a year by 2026. So far, the company has sold about 17,000 Bolts.

GM's new electric vehicle platform in 2021 will serve as a base for at least nine derivatives, ranging from a compact crossover to a large seven-passenger luxury sports utility vehicle and a large commercial van. It will also provide the underpinning for a shared autonomous vehicle (AV) that GM plans to put into commercial service.

Before the new platform arrives, GM plans to introduce three new electric vehicles by 2020, including two crossovers, that will share basic components with the Bolt, Barra said. She described GM as "the only fully integrated developer of AVs with true scale capability."

"We are not capital constrained in our EV or AV development," she added.

GM is generating strong profit from selling trucks and sport utility vehicles in the United States, and Barra reaffirmed a promise to investors that GM's core North American vehicle business should achieve 10 percent pre-tax profit margins.

Oct 24 (Reuters) - Venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ), which has invested in SpaceX, said it is independently probing sexual harassment allegations against its founding partner Steve Jurvetson.

The company came to know about "indirect and second-hand allegations" against Jurvetson earlier this summer, a DFJ spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.

"We immediately opened an independent investigation, which is ongoing at this time," the spokeswoman said.

Technology news website The Information earlier reported that the Menlo Park, California-based firm has hired an external law firm to investigate charges against Jurvetson and had started the probe in August after rumors on his conduct with women. http://bit.ly/2yPuDkY

Jurvetson was not immediately available for comment.

Tesla says it will fight lawsuit claiming racial discrimination - Reuters News

{{20171115T140456.843+0000}}Tesla says it will fight lawsuit claiming racial discriminationNov 15 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Wednesday it would fight a class-action lawsuit filed against it earlier this week claiming the electric automaker's California production plant was a "hotbed for racist behavior."

The lawsuit, filed on Monday by former Tesla worker Marcus Vaughn on behalf of a group of black workers at the plant, claimed that they were addressed using racial slurs and that the company ignored their complaints. [nL1N1NJ20U]

Tesla contested details of the lawsuit in a blog post on Tuesday and signaled it would fight it.

"At Tesla, we would rather pay ten times the settlement demand in legal fees and fight to the ends of the Earth than give in to extortion and allow this abuse of the legal system," the blog post said. http://bit.ly/2mrs8R5

Vaughn had said in the lawsuit that he was routinely called the "n-word" by supervisors and coworkers after he began working at the factory in April, and that Tesla never investigated his claims following written complaints.

Tesla said it had investigated "disappointing behavior" several months ago involving a group of individuals who worked on or near Vaughn's team and fired three employees.

Monday's lawsuit was at least the third filed this year against Tesla by black workers who say the company ignored their complaints of racial harassment.

Vaughn in the lawsuit also said he was fired in October for "not having a positive attitude."

Tesla said in its blog post that Vaughn was not fired, he left when his six-month temporary contract had simply ended.

"Tesla is absolutely against any form of discrimination, harassment, or unfair treatment of any kind," said Tesla. "When we hear complaints, we take them very seriously, investigate thoroughly and, if proven to be true, take immediate action."

BREAKINGVIEWS-Tencent's overseas strategy is name of the game  - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20171115T115402.566+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Tencent's overseas strategy is name of the game (The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Robyn Mak

HONG KONG, Nov 15 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tencent <0700.HK> has mastered the skill of entertaining millions of Chinese smartphone-wielding consumers. Now it needs to export that talent beyond its home market. Mobile games helped power quarterly sales to 65.2 billion yuan ($9.8 billion), up 61 percent from a year earlier, but growth in China's gaming sector is likely to slow quickly and Tencent's investments abroad have so far been a mess.

Pony Ma's firm raked in 26.8 billion yuan in sales from online games in the three months to end-September. "Honour of Kings", the fantasy role-playing game which boasts an estimated 80 million daily active users, is so wildly popular one state-backed newspaper has labelled it too addictive.

Veiled compliments aside, annual sales growth in China's online gaming market is set to slow from 21 percent this year to just 5 percent next year, according to iResearch. And while Tencent is diversifying into things like advertising, payments, and video-streaming, games will still account for almost 40 percent of total revenue in 2018, Morgan Stanley analysts reckon.

That helps explain the $472 billion behemoth's rush overseas. The Shenzhen-based company last year led a consortium to buy Supercell, the Finnish maker of mobile hit "Clash of Clans", for $8.6 billion. Beyond gaming, Tencent has also snapped up minority stakes in U.S. electric car-maker Tesla , New York-listed messaging-app Snap and Indian ride-sharing group Ola.

Yet these scatter-shot investments are yet to support its core business. Earlier this year, Tencent announced it would release an international version of "Honour of Kings", swapping out Chinese characters for more familiar Western ones like the Batman. But the much-anticipated North American launch has been delayed until sometime next year.

It'll take sharper plans to justify trading at 40 times earnings. Shares of Tencent have more than doubled over the past year and trade at over 30 percent above their average two-year forward earnings multiple. Tencent's overseas strategy is the real name of the game.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Chinese gaming and social-media company Tencent on Nov. 15 reported revenue of 65.2 billion yuan ($9.8 billion) for the three months to end-September, an increase of 61 percent compared to the same period a year earlier. Earnings rose 69 percent to 18 billion yuan.

- Revenue from online games topped 26.8 billion yuan, up 48 percent from a year earlier.

- In the third quarter this year, Tencent's "Honour of Kings" was the No.1 mobile game in the world by revenue on Apple's App Store, according to data from SensorTower. The company had planned to release an international version of the game, called "Arena of Valor", in the United States and Canada in November, but has delayed the launch to next year.

- Separately, disappearing-messaging-app company Snap on Nov. 8 disclosed that Tencent and its affiliates had bought a 12 percent stake in the U.S.-based group on the open market through its non-voting class A shares.

REUTERS SUMMIT-Short-seller Chanos adds to Tesla bet, predicts CEO will leave - 路透新闻

{{20171114T222248.806+0000}}REUTERS SUMMIT-Short-seller Chanos adds to Tesla bet, predicts CEO will leave(Adds Tesla did not respond to request for comment)

By David Randall and Jennifer Ablan

NEW YORK, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Noted short-seller Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates continued to add to his short position in electric car maker Tesla Inc throughout the year even as the company's shares rallied, he said at the Reuters Global Investment 2018 Outlook Summit on Tuesday.

Chanos, who first disclosed his short position in Tesla in May last year, said he expected company co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk to step down as CEO by 2020 to focus on his private rocketship company SpaceX as competitors such as BMW and Porsche expand their lines of luxury electric vehicles.

"Obviously this is not being valued as a car company, it's being valued on Musk ... he's the reason people own the stock," Chanos said.

Shares of Tesla are up 44 percent for the year to date, at one point pushing the company's market value higher than competitor General Motors despite Tesla's not turning a profit.

On Nov. 1, Tesla reported its largest-ever quarterly loss and pushed back its target for volume production of its new Model 3 sedan by three months. The company said it now expects to build 5,000 Model 3s per week by late in the first quarter of 2018 from its original target date of December.

Despite the production delays, Tesla has been among the most painful for short-sellers this year, with losses among funds that bet on its decline totaling more than $4 billion this year, according to S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm.

"Put it this way," Chanos said. "If you wouldn't be short a multi-billion-dollar loss-making enterprise in a cyclical business, with a leveraged balance sheet, questionable accounting, every executive leaving, run by a CEO with a questionable relationship with the truth, what would you be short? It sort of ticks all the boxes."

He said the company is burning more than $1 billion in cash each quarter and will have a harder time tapping capital markets if and when Musk leaves.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

{{20171113T232953.694+0000}}UPDATE 1-Jurvetson quits VC firm DFJ, on leave from Tesla amid harassment probe(Adds comments from DFJ)

Nov 13 (Reuters) - Steve Jurvetson on Monday resigned from venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ) and took a leave of absence form the boards of Tesla Inc and SpaceX amid an internal probe into sexual harassment allegations made against him.

Jurvetson, founding partner of DFJ, denied the allegations and said in a tweet on Monday, "I am leaving DFJ to focus on personal matters, including taking legal action against those whose false statements have defamed me." (http://bit.ly/2zVC0Zx)

DFJ, which has invested in Tesla's SpaceX, said three weeks back that it had started an independent probe after it came to know about "indirect and second-hand allegations" against Jurvetson. [nL4N1N01UZ]

"As of today and by mutual agreement, Steve Jurvetson will be leaving DFJ," a spokeswoman for the Menlo Park, California-based firm said in an e-mailed statement.

A Tesla spokesperson said by e-mail, "Steve Jurvetson is on a leave of absence from the SpaceX and Tesla boards pending resolution of these allegations."

Tesla hit by class-action lawsuit claiming racial discrimination  - Reuters News

{{20171113T223229.000+0000}}Tesla hit by class-action lawsuit claiming racial discrimination By Daniel Wiessner

Nov 13 (Reuters) - U.S. automaker Tesla Inc on Monday was hit with a class-action lawsuit claiming its California production plant is a "hotbed for racist behavior."

The lawsuit filed in California state court in Oakland is at least the third filed this year by black workers who say they were addressed using racial slurs and that the company ignored their complaints.

But Monday's lawsuit, filed by former Tesla employee Marcus Vaughn, is the first to bring those claims on behalf of a large class of black workers at the automaker's Fremont, California factory.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

The company is also facing lawsuits accusing it of discrimination against gay and older workers. It has denied those claims.

Vaughn in the lawsuit says he was routinely called the "n-word" by supervisors and coworkers after he began working at the factory in April. He says he complained in writing to human resources officials, but the company never investigated his claims.

Vaughn says he was fired in October for "not having a positive attitude." He is seeking unspecified damages under a California anti-discrimination law.

The growing number of discrimination lawsuits against Tesla come as the company is also facing a unionization campaign from the United Auto Workers.

In February, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk told the website Gizmodo that an employee who wrote a blog post criticizing the company was "paid by the UAW to join Tesla and agitate for a union."

The union and the worker denied that he had been paid by UAW. Last month, the union filed a complaint with a federal labor board on behalf of scores of workers who it says were laid off because they support the union.

The company denied the claims and said the decision was based on employee performance reviews.

Continental eyes investment in solid-state batteries - Reuters News

{{20171111T122627.995+0000}}Continental eyes investment in solid-state batteriesFRANKFURT, Nov 11 (Reuters) - German automotive supplier Continental is considering investing in battery production to compete with Asian and U.S. manufacturers, Chief Executive Elmar Degenhart told trade weekly Automobilwoche in an interview published on Saturday.

"We could well imagine getting into the production of innovative batteries," he said. "That also goes for producing battery cells."

Degenhart said, however, that Conti would not invest in the lithium-ion batteries that are currently in use, but rather in the next generation of solid-state batteries, which might go into production in 2024 or 2025.

"We need a technology leap in energy density and costs," he said. "Such solid-state cells can manage without liquid electrolyte and so are far less flammable."

Although European carmakers assemble battery packs for electric cars, the region has no significant player in battery cells - the essential building blocks for the batteries that are now mostly made in Asia.

The market is dominated by Japanese firms Panasonic <6752.T> and NEC <6701.T>, Korea's LG <051910.KS> and Samsung <005930.KS> and China's BYD <002594.SZ> and CATL, as well as U.S. manufacturer Tesla .

Degenhart said he would aim for a consortium to share the cost, which he estimated at 3 billion euros ($3.5 billion) for a plant that could supply around 500,000 electric cars a year.

The European Union last month hosted automotive, chemical and engineering executives to discuss developing battery manufacturing in the bloc, and said EU funding could support the creation of such a consortium. [nL8N1ME2U9]

Degenhart said it would make sense to build three plants, one in Europe, one in America and one in Asia to be close to customers in each region.

He added that Germany would be out of the question as a location due to its high electricity prices, pointing out that LG and Samsung were building smaller battery factories in Poland and Hungary, where electricity was 50 percent cheaper. ($1 = 0.8574 euros)

UPDATE 1-U.S. safety board to probe self-driving shuttle crash in Las Vegas - Reuters News

{{20171110T200914.372+0000}}UPDATE 1-U.S. safety board to probe self-driving shuttle crash in Las Vegas(Adds additional statement from NTSB, details of damage)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Federal transportation safety officials headed to Las Vegas on Friday to investigate a collision this week between a self-driving shuttle bus on its first day of service and a truck, which was blamed on human error.

The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, which has the power to issue safety recommendations and determines probable causes of crashes, wants to learn more about "how self-driving vehicles interact with their environment and the other human-driven vehicles around them," said NTSB spokesman Christopher O'Neil.

There have been other crashes involving self-driving vehicles but this was the first involving a self-driving vehicle operating in public service, O'Neil said. Four NTSB investigators were expected to arrive in Las Vegas on Friday.

The Navya Arma, an autonomous and electric vehicle operated by Keolis North America, went into service on Wednesday. A few hours later, a delivery truck backed into the stopped shuttle, according to a reporter on the shuttle and one of its sponsor companies.

Las Vegas police issued the truck driver a ticket, the city government said in a blog post. The shuttle's front end sustained minor damage, including a crumpled front fender, and resumed service on Thursday.

"The shuttle did what it was supposed to do, in that its sensors registered the truck and the shuttle stopped," the city said.

The Automobile Association of America (AAA) of Southern Nevada, one of the shuttle's sponsors, said it would assist the safety board's investigation.

"Working together and sharing information will ensure this new technology is safely implemented for the public, and that's AAA's top priority," the organization said in a statement.

The shuttle is also sponsored by the city of Las Vegas, Keolis North America and the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada.

Reporter Jeff Zurschmeide, who was on the shuttle at the time of the crash, said the self-driving vehicle did what it was programmed to do but not everything a human driver might do.

"That's a critical point," Zurschmeide wrote on digitaltrends.com. "We had about 20 feet of empty street behind us (I looked), and most human drivers would have thrown the car into reverse and used some of that space to get away from the truck. Or at least leaned on the horn and made our presence harder to miss."

The crash follows a rising number of incidents involving human drivers behaving improperly or recklessly around self-driving cars. There have been 12 crashes in California alone since Sept. 8 involving General Motors Co's self-driving unit, Cruise Automation. All were the fault of human drivers in other vehicles, GM told regulators. [nL2N1MG01F]

The NTSB investigated a May 2016 crash of a Tesla Inc Model S that killed a driver using the vehicle's semi-autonomous "Autopilot" system. In September, the board recommended that auto safety regulators and automakers take steps to ensure that semi-autonomous systems were not misused. [nL2N1LT0T4]

UPDATE 1-Finnish nickel producer, Trafigura tap electric vehicle boom - Reuters News

{{20171110T183424.820+0000}}UPDATE 1-Finnish nickel producer, Trafigura tap electric vehicle boom(Adds detail on new Trafigura nickel/cobalt offtake, financing)

HELSINKI, Nov 10 (Reuters) - Finland's Terrafame nickel mine is planning to start producing material for electric vehicle batteries by 2020, the company said on Friday, after securing $200 million more in funding from commodities trader Trafigura Group.

Trafigura, which will also increase its nickel and cobalt sulphides offtake agreement with Terraframe, is providing the funds with Galena Asset Management and Nordic fund Sampo Plc.

"The new funding package ... is a significant factor enabling Terrafame to move from established industrial operations to investing in new business opportunities associated with the electric vehicle battery segment," Trafigura said in a statement on Friday.

With the electric vehicle revolution gaining speed, miners and metals traders are racing to shore up supply deals with battery makers. This deal will help Trafigura compete on the trading side with rival mining and trading giant Glencore that already dominates cobalt supplies with its assets in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Terraframe, formerly known as Talvivaara , has been under government control since 2015 after years of losses and production problems. It returned to profit last year and commodities trader Trafigura agreed in February to take a stake and help to ramp up production. [nL5N1FV3RJ]

Terrafame said it plans to build a new chemical plant by 2020, which would convert nickel into a valuable form of sulphate, a powder-like substance particularly suited for use in batteries.

Most electric vehicles rely on lithium-ion batteries, with the main component comprised mostly of nickel.

Lithium batteries, which keep a charge over longer distances, are being installed in electric cars from Tesla's top-of-the-line Model X to General Motors' more modestly priced Chevy Bolt.

"The availability of nickel and cobalt is critical for the electric vehicles market to continue developing. As a producer of these metals, Terrafame is aiming to take a leading role in supplying battery manufacturers," Terrafame CEO Joni Lukkaroinen said in a statement.

The new plant would have annual capacity of about 150,000 tonnes of nickel sulphate, which Terrafame said would make it one of the largest producers globally.

The company said it expects to make a final decision on the investment in the first half of 2018.

Trafigura added in its statement that it will market all of Terraframe's forthcoming nickel and cobalt products until end 2027. The trader already takes all of Terraframe's existing output of nickel and cobalt sulphides.

Trafigura added it has extended its current offtake agreement for 80 percent of Terraframe's zinc sulphide precipitates until end 2027.

U.S. safety board to probe self-driving shuttle crash in Las Vegas - Reuters News

{{20171110T181515.507+0000}}U.S. safety board to probe self-driving shuttle crash in Las VegasBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Nov 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a team to Las Vegas to investigate a collision this week between a self-driving shuttle bus and a truck that was blamed on human error.

The board, which has the power to issue safety recommendations and determines probable causes of crashes, said four investigators were expected to arrive on Friday.

The Navya Arma, an autonomous and electric vehicle operated by Keolis North America, went into service on Wednesday. A few hours later, a delivery truck backed into the stopped shuttle, according to a reporter on the shuttle and one of its sponsor companies.

Las Vegas police issued the truck driver a ticket, the city government said in a blog post. The shuttle sustained minor damage.

"The shuttle did what it was supposed to do, in that its sensors registered the truck and the shuttle stopped," the city said.

The Automobile Association of America (AAA) of Southern Nevada, one of the shuttle's sponsors, said it would assist the safety board's investigation.

"Working together and sharing information will ensure this new technology is safely implemented for the public, and that's AAA's top priority," the organization said in a statement.

The shuttle also is sponsored by the city of Las Vegas, Keolis North America and the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada.

Reporter Jeff Zurschmeide, who was on the shuttle at the time of the crash, said the self-driving vehicle did what it was programmed to do but not everything a human driver might do.

"That's a critical point," Zurschmeide wrote on digitaltrends.com. "We had about 20 feet of empty street behind us (I looked), and most human drivers would have thrown the car into reverse and used some of that space to get away from the truck. Or at least leaned on the horn and made our presence harder to miss."

The crash follows a rising number of incidents involving human drivers behaving improperly or recklessly around self-driving cars. There have been 12 crashes in California alone since Sept. 8 involving General Motors Co's self-driving unit, Cruise Automation. All were the fault of human drivers in other vehicles, GM told regulators. [nL2N1MG01F]

NTSB investigated a May 2016 crash of a Tesla Inc Model S that killed a driver using the vehicle's semi-autonomous "Autopilot" system. The board recommended in September auto safety regulators and automakers take steps to ensure that semi-autonomous systems were not misused. [nL2N1LT0T4]

U.S. Senate tax plan does not kill electric vehicle credit - Reuters News

{{20171110T020033.211+0000}}U.S. Senate tax plan does not kill electric vehicle creditWASHINGTON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate tax reform proposal unveiled on Thursday does not eliminate a $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit as Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have proposed.

Killing the credit could hurt automakers like General Motors Co , Volkswagen AG , Tesla Inc and Nissan Motor Co <7201.T>. Current law allows automakers to use the credit, which phases out after an automaker hits 200,000 plug-in vehicles sold. Electric vehicles have expensive batteries that make them pricier than gasoline-powered vehicles.

UPDATE 1-SpaceX to launch Turkish satellites, minister says - Reuters News

{{20171109T084349.618+0000}}UPDATE 1-SpaceX to launch Turkish satellites, minister says(Adds details, background)

ISTANBUL, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Turkey's Turksat 5A and 5B satellites will be launched by Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX), Turkish Transport Minister Ahmet Arslan said on Thursday.

"Our friends decided to launch our satellites with the Falcon 9 rockets of Airbus' subcontractor, SpaceX," Arslan said at an event in Istanbul.

The agreement to build and launch satellites will be worth around $500 million, Turksat Chairman said during his speech at the same event.

In October, Airbus submitted the best bid to build the satellites. The 5A satellite will be launched in 2020 and the 5B in 2021.

Elon Musk, chief executive of American electric car maker Tesla and aerospace company SpaceX, met Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara on Wednesday and discussed cooperation between Tesla, SpaceX and Turkish firms.

Musk's SpaceX plans a manned mission to Mars by 2024 and a rocket capable of carrying passengers from one continent to another in less than an hour.

China electric car startup Nio raises over $1 bln from Tencent, others -sources  - Reuters News

{{20171109T062308.071+0000}}China electric car startup Nio raises over $1 bln from Tencent, others -sources By Julie Zhu

HONG KONG, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle startup Nio has raised more than $1 billion in its latest fundraising round, led by existing investor Tencent Holdings Ltd <0700.HK>, valuing the firm at about $5 billion, two people with knowledge of the matter said.

New investors in the round include U.S. hedge fund Lone Pine Capital, Chinese investment firm CITIC Capital and Scottish fund manager Baillie Gifford, said one of the people.

The fundraising comes as Beijing has been promoting electric vehicles in its battle with urban smog, with startups flooding the market after it opened up the sector to investment from technology firms and other backers outside the industry.

It marks a hectic news week for Tencent, Asia's second-most valuable company with a market capitalisation of around $475 billion.

Snap Inc said on Wednesday that Tencent had taken a 12 percent stake in the messaging app. A day earlier, Tencent's e-book unit China Literature Ltd <0772.HK> saw its shares surge more than 80 percent in their debut. [nL3N1NE4G2][nL3N1NE1AM]

Tencent, CITIC Capital and Baillie Gifford didn't immediately respond to requests for comment on the Nio fundraising. Nio declined to comment. Lone Pine Capital was not immediately available for comment outside of normal business hours.

The sources declined to be named as the financing plans were not public.

Shanghai-based Nio, founded by Chinese internet entrepreneur William Li in 2014, has already attracted big-name investors, counting Tencent as its main backer alongside investment firms Hillhouse Capital Group and Sequoia Capital.

Nio, formerly known as NextEV, is also among the first of a raft of Chinese electric vehicle firms to launch a production vehicle, with many so far only showing concept cars.

Its first mass production car - the ES8 pure-electric, seven-seat sport-utility vehicle is set to be released in mid- December, according to the company. Chairman Li told Reuters in April that the model would offer more features than the Tesla Model X at a lower price. [nL3N1HS28T]

Tencent is also an investor in U.S. electric car maker Tesla Inc .

Nio has also vowed to bring an autonomous electric car to the U.S. market by 2020. The firm said in April it was teaming up with China's fourth-largest automaker Chongqing Changan Automobile <000625.SZ> to form a joint venture to cooperate on researching and selling electric cars. [nL3N1HI21P]

It was valued at about 20 billion yuan ($3.02 billion) when it raised $600 million in March, according to Chinese media reports at the time.

Tencent's own news portal, Tencent Technology, first reported Nio's latest financing round on Wednesday. ($1 = 6.6249 Chinese yuan renminbi)

Michigan Senator urges Congress to retain electric car tax credit - Reuters News

{{20171108T212606.063+0000}}Michigan Senator urges Congress to retain electric car tax creditBy David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - A Democratic U.S. Senator from Michigan on Wednesday urged his fellow lawmakers to retain a $7,500 tax credit for people who buy electronic vehicles instead of eliminating it as Republicans have proposed.

In a letter seen by Reuters, Senator Gary Peters wrote to Senate leaders that "a new generation of jobs and families will be supported by electric vehicles. Eliminating important economic incentives for electric vehicles would be a step in the wrong direction."

Last week, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives proposed to eliminate the tax credit, which could hurt automakers such as General Motors Co , Tesla Inc and Nissan Motor Co <7201.T>. [nL2N1N81A8]

Republicans in both chambers of Congress backed by U.S. President Donald Trump, also a Republican, are working on separate plans to give the U.S. tax code its biggest overhaul since the 1980s. [nL1N1NE1KT] Republican senators are set to introduce a tax proposal on Thursday. A spokesman for Senator Orrin Hatch, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, did not immediately comment.

Critics of the credit say electric vehicle buyers tend to be wealthier than average and do not need subsidies.

Automakers have invested billions in electric vehicles and announced plans to shift significant production to plug-in models.

Current law allows automakers to use the credit, which phases out after an automaker hits 200,000 plug-in vehicles sold. Electric vehicles have expensive batteries that make them pricier than gasoline-powered vehicles. GM and Tesla may hit the limit for vehicles that can get the tax credit by 2019.

Environmental groups and an auto industry trade group oppose the House proposal, which would kick in at the end of this year. GM vowed to fight, saying the credits are "an important customer benefit that can help accelerate the acceptance of electric vehicles." Tesla declined to comment.

Former President Barack Obama unsuccessfully proposed hiking the tax credit for electric vehicles to $10,000 and converting it to a point-of-sale rebate.

Automakers face mandates from California and a dozen other states to produce a rising number of zero-emission vehicles and have said the credits are essential to meeting requirements.

UPDATE 4-China's Tencent takes 12 percent stake in Snap as shares plunge - Reuters News

{{20171108T180252.961+0000}}UPDATE 4-China's Tencent takes 12 percent stake in Snap as shares plunge((Adds Snap comment, graphic showing Snap share plunges))

By Supantha Mukherjee and Munsif Vengattil

Nov 8 (Reuters) - Snap Inc said on Wednesday that Chinese tech and media investment firm Tencent Holdings Ltd <0700.HK> had taken a 12 percent stake in the company, a day after the owner of disappearing-messaging app Snapchat was punished by Wall Street for disappointing quarterly results.

Snap's shares fell 16 percent to $12.67, well below their $17 initial public offering price in March, as investors fretted about Snap's slowing user growth in the latest quarter and viewed Tencent's move as an investment rather than the precursor to a merger. [nL3N1ND65C]

"(Tencent) buys all sorts of minority investments, and I don't think we can extrapolate that this means they intend to take over the company," said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter.

Snap said it had only received the details of the stake from Tencent this month. Tencent's 145.8 million class A common shares of Snap, worth about $1.7 billion at Wednesday's price, give the Chinese company no voting rights.

Tencent president Martin Lau told Snap his firm is "excited" to deepen its relationship with the firm, Snap said in a regulatory filing. A Snap spokesman declined to comment further.

The Chinese tech company, which owns mobile chat service WeChat, has bought stakes in several companies over the past few years, including electric car maker Tesla Inc and ride services company Lyft Inc. In 2013 it invested in Snap through an affiliate.

Investments in the United States by Chinese tech heavyweights have become common, and the two countries unveiled $9 billion in new deals on the arrival of U.S. President Donald Trump in Beijing on Wednesday. [nS6N1MZ01X]

Apart from Tencent, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Baidu Inc have poured cash from a decade of growth in China into buying stakes in U.S. firms.

Snap's ownership structure, which reserves 95 percent of voting rights for its co-founders, made it likely Tencent was just accumulating a financial stake, analysts said.

While the stake could lead to a business partnership with Tencent and help Snap expand its reach into China, Morningstar analyst Ali Mogharabi said Snap's problems remained, chiefly slowing user growth and competition from Facebook Inc's Instagram.

ROLE MODEL

Snap co-founder and Chief Executive Evan Spiegel, who has in the past referred to Tencent as a role model, said on Tuesday that he was looking to redesign Snapchat to reach a broader audience.

Snap's daily active users (DAU) stood at 178 million in the third quarter, below expectations of 181.8 million, according to research firm FactSet.

The company has disappointed investors each quarter since it floated on the New York Stock Exchange in March. Snap has fallen by more than a half since its high of $29.44 on March 3, a day after it went public.

Unlike many U.S. stock market-listed corporations, Snap is not obligated to disclose changes in Tencent's ownership of Snap's class A stock.

LEAD 1-Le chinois Tencent prend une participation de 12% dans Snap - Reuters (French)

{{20171108T164648.845+0000}}LEAD 1-Le chinois Tencent prend une participation de 12% dans Snap(Actualisé avec précisions et cours de Bourse)

8 novembre (Reuters) - Snap , le propriétaire de l'application Snapchat, a annoncé mercredi que le géant technologique chinois Tencent Holdings <0700.HK> avait pris une participation de 12% dans le groupe, après avoir annoncé la veille un nombre d'utilisateurs jugés décevant au troisième trimestre.

En réaction à cette annonce, le titre s'est brièvement retourné à la hausse, gagnant de 1,2% en avant-Bourse, alors qu'il perdait jusqu'à 20% quelques minutes auparavant. Il abandonnait 15,08% à 12,84 dollars vers 16h40 GMT à Wall Street.

La start-up américaine a annoncé mardi un chiffre d'affaires et une croissance du nombre des utilisateurs actifs de Snapchat au troisième trimestre inférieurs aux attentes. [nL5N1ND9H3]

Snap a indiqué que Tencent avait acquis 145,8 millions d'actions ordinaires de catégorie A sans droit de vote via des achats sur le marché libre ce mois-ci. (http://bit.ly/2zqvybE)

Snap avait environ 1,2 milliard d'actions en circulation.

Ces dernières années, Tencent a investi dans plusieurs groupes technologiques comme Tesla et le spécialiste de la voiture autonome Lyft.

Même si cette prise de participation pourrait donner naissance à un partenariat avec Tencent et permettre à snap de pénétrer en Chine, les difficultés de la société américaine demeurent, estime Ali Mogharabi, analyste chez Morningstar, qui évoque la faible croissance du nombre des utilisateurs et la concurrence d'Instagram, propriété de Facebook .

ANKARA, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Tesla Inc chief executive Elon Musk met on Wednesday to discuss cooperation between Tesla, SpaceX and Turkish firms, Turkey's presidential spokesman said.

Musk, who is in Turkey to attend the Global SatShow in Istanbul, met Erdogan and Turkey's transportation and industry ministers at the presidential palace in Ankara.

Presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said Musk and Erdogan discussed potential joint operations between Tesla Inc, Musk's SpaceX company and Turkish firms, as well as the launch of Turkey's Turksat 5A and 5B satellites.

"We also exchanged views on what sort of joint operations Turkish firms could have with the SpaceX and Tesla companies," Kalin was quoted as saying by the state-run Anadolu news agency.

Turkey aims to launch the Turksat 5A satellite in 2020 and the 5B in 2021. In October, Airbus submitted the best bid in a tender to build the Turkish satellites.

Kalin said an agreement would be signed with Airbus on Thursday, and Musk would also be present at the meeting as a subcontractor.

Musk's SpaceX plans its first trip to Mars in 2022, carrying only cargo, to be followed by a manned mission in 2024.

Kalin also said Erdogan and Musk had discussed electric cars, days after Turkey unveiled plans to launch a car made entirely in Turkey by 2021, which the president cast as a long-harboured dream of the Turkish people.

Tesla vai comprar fabricante de equipamentos de automação Perbix - Reuters (Portuguese, Brazil)

{{20171107T142949.165+0000}}Tesla vai comprar fabricante de equipamentos de automação Perbix7 Nov (Reuters) - A montadora de veículos elétricos Tesla disse nesta terça-feira vai comprar a Perbix Machine Co, que projeta equipamentos de fabricação automatizada.

Os termos financeiros do acordo não foram divulgados.

A Perbix, com sede em Minnesota, é fornecedora de Tesla há quase três anos e a aquisição pela montadora permitirá que mais peças sejam produzidas internamente.

"Com a compra da Perbix, a Tesla avança em seus esforços para transformar a própria fábrica em um produto - para construir a máquina que faz a máquina", disse a montadora em seu site.

O presidente-executivo da Tesla, Elon Musk, insiste em realizar grande parte do trabalho dentro da empresa, uma das razões pelas quais a Tesla vem adiando as metas de produção do sedã Model 3.

A montadora fabrica muitas das suas peças, incluindo assentos de carro, que as grandes montadoras costumam terceirizar para empresas especializadas.

Workhorse to test electric vans for new customer in California, Ohio - Reuters News

{{20171107T140001.928+0000}}Workhorse to test electric vans for new customer in California, OhioBy Nick Carey

DETROIT, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Electric delivery van maker Workhorse Group Inc said on Tuesday it will test its new lightweight N-Gen electric van in cities in Ohio and California as the race to develop mass-market electric delivery vehicles heats up.

Workhorse's customers already include package delivery groups United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp .

Chief Executive Officer Steve Burns told Reuters the company has signed up a new customer but said he could not disclose the name. Workhorse will test two versions of the van, including one carrying a drone in the roof for remote deliveries, he added. The company is already testing van-based drone deliveries with UPS.

Burns did not disclose the exact locations for the tests, but said they would take place in several cities in Ohio and California.

Cincinnati-based Workhorse is also in the running for a contract to replace the delivery vans in the United States Postal Service's fleet, in partnership with a unit of Singapore Technologies Engineering Ltd . The N-Gen has a similar frame to the vehicle the USPS is evaluating.

Workhorse said the tests will begin in the first quarter of 2018.

The market for medium- and heavy-duty electric trucks is in its infancy and the distance they can travel before recharging is still limited.

They tend to cost more than conventional internal combustion engine vehicles, but as battery costs come down they should become more competitive.

Vehicle manufacturers such as Daimler AG and Navistar International Corp , as well as Tesla Inc and a host of other new entrants, are racing to overcome the challenges of substituting batteries for diesel engines as regulators crack down on carbon dioxide and soot pollution. [nL2N1LA0XJ]

Some manufacturers argue that with their short, largely predictable daily routes, delivery vehicles are a natural market for electrified versions.

Cutting the high cost associated with last-mile delivery as ecommerce has grown has become a major priority for the likes of Amazon Inc , which runs its own delivery service in some cities and has leased cargo planes to reduce expenses.

Daimler said in September that UPS will be the first U.S. commercial customer for its new battery-powered eCanter truck. [nL2N1LV11Y]

U.S. truck leasing and rental company Ryder System Inc is a strategic service partner with Workhorse and last week also ordered 125 all-electric delivery vans from Chanje, a unit of FDG Electric Vehicles Ltd <0729.HK>. [nL2N1N520J]

Workhorse's Burns said the N-Gen van has a lightweight carbon frame, weighs 5,500 lbs (2,495 kg) when empty - 5,000 lbs lighter than comparable vehicles - and its load space measures 500 cubic feet (14 cubic meters).

He said Workhorse vans cost more than conventional vehicles, but gas and fuel savings make up the difference in less than three years.

"The premium that we charge is made back very quickly," he said. "Fleets that look at total cost of ownership understand that and that's how we sell our vehicles."

UPDATE 2-Investments weigh on BMW profit as it strives to regain industry lead - Reuters News

{{20171107T135613.019+0000}}UPDATE 2-Investments weigh on BMW profit as it strives to regain industry lead* BMW faces "challenging" Q4 amid upfront costs - CFO

* Raises FY pretax profit growth target to 5-10 pct

* Q3 profit fell 5.9 pct on technology, personnel costs

* Lowers FY autos revenue growth forecast to 1-5 pct

(Adds analyst, detail, background and shares)

By Andreas Cremer

BERLIN, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Rising costs for new models and technology will weigh on profits at BMW for the rest of the year, it said on Tuesday, as the German carmaker battles to recapture ground lost to rival Mercedes-Benz .

BMW, the top seller of luxury cars for more than a decade, was overtaken by Mercedes last year, and its third quarter operating profit fell 3 percent as it invests in catching up.

The company, which is spending money on electric and self-driving technologies while also upgrading its line-up of conventional models, said upfront costs for the redesigned X3 sport-utility vehicle, due to hit showrooms this month, and the all-new X2 and X7 models would weigh on fourth-quarter results.

"Significant advance payments on R&D (research and development) will be necessary at present and in the coming years," finance chief Nicolas Peter said during a results call.

He predicted a "challenging" fourth quarter, echoing Volkswagen's Audi brand which is also refreshing its line-up of high-end and compact models. [nL8N1N51ST]

BMW shares were down 2.7 percent to 87.53 euros at 1340 GMT, the biggest drop on Germany's benchmark DAX <.GDAXI> index.

"BMW used to be in a league of its own but these days it faces a totally different level of competition from Mercedes, Audi and Land Rover , plus a load of other rebooted smaller players and of course Tesla ," said Bernstein analyst Max Warburton.

Spending on R&D at the BMW group, which includes the Mini and Rolls Royce brands as well as its namesake cars, jumped over a fifth in the first nine months of this year to 4.1 billion euros ($4.7 billion), Peter said.

Third-quarter operating group profit fell to 2.3 billion euros, near the lowest 2.28-billion-euro forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts. [nL8N1N86VC]

As a result, BMW's operating margin slipped to 8.3 percent in the July-to-September quarter from 8.5 percent a year earlier, within its 8-10 percent target range but below Audi's 8.9 percent and 9.2 percent at Mercedes.

"BMW's competitive environment has changed and that's evident in these Q3 numbers," Warburton said.

Despite a 5.9 percent drop in quarterly pretax profit, BMW nudged up its full-year outlook to a 5-10 percent rise from 1-5 percent previously, thanks to a strong first-half performance.

Helped by strong demand for the redesigned 5 Series, BMW's second best-selling model, and an upgraded 4 Series, it forecast a "slight" increase in deliveries to a new record this year.

But it pared back revenue expectations, forecasting sales at its core automotive operations to grow by 1-5 percent amid exchange rate headwinds and political volatility, down from 5-10 percent previously.

($1 = 0.8651 euros)

Tesla buys automation equipment maker Perbix - Reuters News

{{20171107T125142.552+0000}}Tesla buys automation equipment maker PerbixNov 7 (Reuters) - Electric car maker Tesla Inc said on Tuesday it agreed to buy privately held Perbix Machine Co Inc, which designs automated manufacturing equipment.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Minnesota-based Perbix has been a Tesla supplier for nearly three years and an acquisition by the carmaker would allow it to bring more parts production in house. http://bit.ly/2hilfQb

"With the acquisition of Perbix, Tesla further advances its efforts to turn the factory itself into a product – to build the machine that makes the machine," Tesla said on its website.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has insisted on performing much of the work within the company, one of the reasons Tesla has been continually pushing back production targets for the Model 3 sedan.

Tesla makes many of its auto parts, including car seats, which big automakers usually farm out to specialists.

Stephen Hawking dice que tecnología podría poner fin a pobreza, pero pide tener tomar precauciones - Reuters (Spanish)

{{20171106T232112.070+0000}}Stephen Hawking dice que tecnología podría poner fin a pobreza, pero pide tener tomar precaucionesPor Belinda Goldsmith

LISBOA, 6 nov (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - La tecnología podría revertir parte del daño causado al planeta por la industrialización y también ayudar a poner fin a la pobreza, pero la inteligencia artificial (IA) debe ser controlada, dijo el lunes el británico Stephen Hawking.

El científico sostuvo que la tecnología podría cambiar cada uno de los aspectos de la vida actual, pero advirtió que la IA presenta nuevos desafíos.

Sostuvo que esa tecnología, al igual que los robots, amenaza millones de puestos de trabajo, pero destacó que esta nueva revolución podría ayudar a la sociedad a aliviar la pobreza y las enfermedades.

"El desarrollo de la IA podría ser lo peor o lo mejor que le ha pasado a la humanidad", dijo Hawking a través de una teleconferencia en el inicio de la Web Summit en Lisboa, en la que participan unas 60.000 personas.

"Simplemente debemos ser conscientes de los peligros, identificarlos, usar las mejores prácticas posibles y prepararnos por adelantado para las consecuencias", agregó.

Los comentarios de Hawking se dieron en medio de un creciente debate sobre los pros y los contras de la IA, un término usado para describir las máquinas con un código que aprende a medida que hace determinadas cosas.

El emprendedor Elon Musk, jefe ejecutivo de la fabricante de autos eléctricos Tesla Inc y de la compañía de cohetes SpaceX, ha advertido que la IA es una amenaza para la humanidad. Pero el cofundador de Microsoft Bill Gates dijo hace poco en una inusual entrevista que no hay nada por lo que asustarse.

Hawking sostuvo que cada persona tiene un rol que cumplir para asegurar que la actual generación y la próxima estén comprometidas con el estudio de la ciencia para crear "un mundo mejor para toda la raza humana".

"Tenemos que llevar el conocimiento más allá de la discusión teórica respecto a cómo debería ser la IA y tomar decisiones para asegurarnos que planeemos cómo puede ser", destacó Hawking.

Tesla's head of battery engineering exits - Reuters News

{{20171106T204121.440+0000}}Tesla's head of battery engineering exitsNov 6 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's director of battery engineering, Jon Wagner has left the electric car manufacturer, according to his LinkedIn profile.

According to Wagner's LinkedIn page, he is launching a battery and powertrain startup in California. The timeline of his departure is not know.

Wagner, who joined the company in January 2013, was involved in developing technology for all of Tesla's cars, as well as the Powerwall, according to his profile. (http://bit.ly/2hagy7D)

Last week, Tesla pushed back its target for volume production on its new Model 3 sedan by about three months, saying it was difficult to predict how long it would take to fix production bottlenecks. [nL2N1N72DJ]

Tesla had also said that the main constraint was its battery module assembly line at its Nevada Gigafactory, where the company had to redesign part of the production process.

Tesla and Wagner did not respond to requests for comment.

{{20171103T155424.087+0000}}Montadoras planejam 400 estações de carregamento de carros elétricos na Europa até 2020FRANKFURT, 3 Nov (Reuters) - Um grupo de montadoras, a maioria alemãs, vai abrir estações ultrarrápidas de carregamento de veículos elétricos neste ano e planeja uma rede pan-europeia com 400 pontos até 2020, na esperança de diminuir a liderança da Tesla .

Notícias sobre a iniciativa, anunciada pela primeira vez há um ano, foram muito antecipadas, já que os governos pressionam por melhorias na infraestrutura que encorajariam os motoristas a mudar para carros elétricos.

A Ionity, joint venture de BMW , Ford , Daimler e Volkswagen com as marcas Audi e Porsche, quer abrir 20 estações para o público este ano na Alemanha, Noruega e Áustria. Elas ficarão a 120 quilômetros de distância uma da outra e serão operadas em parceria com Tank & Rast [LINDOTA.UL], Circle K e OMV .

"A primeira rede de HPC pan-europeia representa um papel essencial no estabelecimento de um mercado para veículos elétricos", disse o presidente-executivo da Ionity, Michael Hajesch, nesta sexta-feira. Ele afirmou também que as estações receberão pagamentos por meios digitais.

A Ionity ainda está em negociações com fornecedores de estações de carregamento e uma decisão deve ser tomada em breve, disse uma porta-voz, que não quis dizer quanto a joint venture vai investir.

HINTERGRUND-Henne oder Ei? Für E-Autos fehlen Zehntausende Ladesäulen - Reuters (German)

{{20171103T121429.065+0000}}HINTERGRUND-Henne oder Ei? Für E-Autos fehlen Zehntausende Ladesäulen(Aktualisierte Wiederholung vom 5. September)

* Studie: Ausbau der Infrastruktur ist Schlüssel zum Erfolg

* Experten sehen Bedarf für fünf bis zehn Mal so viele Stationen

* Aber für Betreiber rechnet es sich noch nicht

- von Irene Preisinger

München, 03. Nov (Reuters) - Das eigene Auto steht für viele Menschen für Freiheit. Setzt sich ein Fahrer in Flensburg ans Steuer, scheint er die Gewissheit zu brauchen, problemlos bis nach Garmisch-Partenkirchen gelangen zu können. Dass er auf den rund tausend Kilometern auch mal Sprit nachtanken muss - kein Thema. Die nächste Tankstelle kommt bestimmt. Sollen aber die knapp 20 Kilometer, die Berufstätige in Deutschland im Schnitt auf dem Weg zur Arbeit zurücklegen, im Elektroauto bewältigt werden, macht das viele Fahrer schon nervös: Wo steht die nächste Ladesäule? Ist sie frei? "Eine ausgebaute Ladeinfrastruktur ist der Schlüssel für den Erfolg der Elektromobilität", betonen Experten vom Deutschen Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) und vom Karlsruher Institut für Technologie (KIT) in einer Studie.

Die Wissenschaftler haben untersucht, wie viele öffentliche Ladepunkte in Deutschland bis zum Jahr 2020 benötigt werden, sollten dann tatsächlich - wie es die Politik anpeilt - eine Million Fahrzeuge mit Batterie-Antrieb auf den Straßen rollen. Die Zahl der Stromtankstellen müsste dafür nach Berechnungen der Forscher mehr als drei Mal so groß sein, wie sie es heute ist: 35.000 öffentliche und sogenannte halböffentliche Ladepunkte, etwa beim Einkaufen, würden gebraucht. Zusätzlich seien bis zu 4.000 Schnellladesäulen für den Alltagsverkehr empfehlenswert - davon gibt es derzeit knapp 570. Die Experten raten, das Netz rasch auszubauen, auch weil sichtbare Infrastruktur das Vertrauen in die E-Mobilität steigere. Die von der Bundesregierung ins Leben gerufene "Nationale Plattform Elektromobilität" (NPE) hält 2020 sogar 70.000 öffentliche Ladepunkte sowie 7.100 Schnellladestationen für nötig.

Der Weg zur Elektromobilität auf breiter Basis ist noch sehr weit, da sind sich alle Fachleute einig: 34.000 E-Autos waren Ende 2016 in Deutschland zugelassen und gut 165.000 Hybrid-Pkw, die Verbrennungsmotor und Batterieantrieb kombinieren. In diesem Jahr zog die Nachfrage nach reinen Elektroautos dank der staatlichen Kaufprämie an: Von Januar bis Oktober wurden laut Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt 18.613 Stromer neu zugelassen. Nicht nur die aus Kundensicht zu geringe Reichweite bremst bisher den Verkauf von E-Autos. Die Fahrzeuge sind oft auch teurer als solche mit Benzin- oder Dieselmotor, zudem gibt es deutlich weniger Auswahl. Ob erst neue Modelle für Schwung beim Absatz sorgen müssen, oder erst die Infrastruktur auszubauen ist - das bleibt das ungelöste Henne-Ei-Problem der Branche.

So klagt der Bundesverband der Energie- und Wasserwirtschaft (BDEW), der Betrieb von Ladesäulen lohne sich wegen der geringen Fahrzeugzahl noch nicht. "Die Automobilindustrie muss jetzt endlich nachziehen und E-Autos auf den Markt bringen, die in Preis und Leistung einer breiteren Käuferschicht entsprechen", forderte BDEW-Hauptgeschäftsführer Stefan Kapferer.

Voran geht es nur im Schritttempo: Die deutschen Autobauer wollen bis 2020 ihr Angebot an E-Auto-Modellen auf rund 100 mehr als verdreifachen; die nächste Generation soll mit einer Akkuladung 500 bis 600 Kilometer weit fahren können. Die Zahl der öffentlichen Ladepunkte wächst immer schneller, liegt aber derzeit erst bei knapp 11.000.

DIE KRÄFTE BÜNDELN

Dass es so langsam vorwärts geht, hat Experten zufolge einfache Gründe: "Heute verdient man mit Ladesäulen noch kein Geld", erläutert Jens Lorkowski vom Beratungsunternehmen Oliver Wyman. Energieversorger, Autobauer und Kommunen hätten deshalb lange halbherzig nach cleveren Ansätzen gesucht - und die jeweils anderen für zuständig erklärt. "Bisher haben alle Beteiligten die heiße Kartoffel hin- und hergeschoben", kritisiert auch Klaus Schmitz von der Unternehmensberatung Arthur D. Little. Doch damit sei nun Schluss: "Die Autobauer nehmen das jetzt zusammen mit Partnern selber in die Hand. Sie können nicht warten." Am Freitag kündigten Audi, BMW, Daimler, Ford, Porsche und Volkswagen an, dass ihr Gemeinschaftsunternehmen Ionity mit dem Aufbau eines europaweiten Netzes von 400 Ladestationen mit jeweils bis zu sechs Ladepunkten beginnt.

UPDATE 1-Carmakers plan 400 Europe car charging stations by 2020 - Reuters News

{{20171103T102654.472+0000}}UPDATE 1-Carmakers plan 400 Europe car charging stations by 2020* To open 20 stations to the public this year

* To expand to 100 stations in 2018

* Electric cars and chargers: http://tmsnrt.rs/2jmqNcC

(Recasts, adds context, details)

FRANKFURT, Nov 3 (Reuters) - A group of mainly German carmakers will open ultra-fast electric vehicle charging stations this year and plans a pan-European network of 400 by 2020, hoping to narrow Tesla's lead.

News about the initiative, first flagged a year ago, had been long anticipated as governments push for improvements in infrastructure that would encourage drivers to switch to electric cars. [nL1N1DU18Q]

IONITY, a joint venture of BMW AG , Daimler AG , Ford Motor Co and Volkswagen with its Audi and Porsche brands, plans to open 20 stations to the public this year in Germany, Norway and Austria. They will be 120 km (75 miles) apart and run in partnership with Tank & Rast [LINDOTA.UL], Circle K and OMV .

"The first pan-European HPC network plays an essential role in establishing a market for electric vehicles," IONITY's CEO Michael Hajesch said on Friday. He added that the fast-charging stations would also offer digital-payment capability.

IONITY is still in talks with charging station suppliers and a decision is expected soon, a spokeswoman said, declining to say how much the joint venture would invest.

Installing thousands of High-Power Charging (HPC) stations across the globe will require billions of dollars in investment and offer an opportunity to manufacturers. The car consortium's new fast chargers will cost about 200,000 euros ($233,000) each, sources said previously. [nL5N1EZ1OG]

Companies ranging from engineering conglomerates such as Siemens to small specialists like ChargePoint are all hoping for a slice of the pie. [nL8N1LF39T]

IONITY will expand its network to 100 stations in 2018, each one enabling several drivers of different car brands to charge their vehicles at the same time.

Anxiety over whether battery-powered cars have the range to reach their destination is inhibiting some drivers from switching from petrol or diesel models.

But with U.S. all-electric challenger Tesla stealing a lead, established brands are teaming up to ensure that electric vehicles (EVs) can get quickly back on the road.

Each charging point will have a capacity of 350 kW, and will use an existing European standard, the Combined Charging System, to reduce charging times compared to existing systems.

A half-hour charge will give a Tesla driver about 270 km in extra driving range - roughly half the time it would take to get a similar boost at a 50 kW charge point that is now the industry standard. ($1 = 0.8587 euros)

Carmakers launch pan-European charging network - Reuters News

{{20171103T070001.503+0000}}Carmakers launch pan-European charging networkFRANKFURT, Nov 3 (Reuters) - A group of mainly German car makers said on Friday it had formed a joint venture to build out a pan-European network of 400 fast charging stations for electric vehicles by the year 2020.

The venture, called IONITY, is backed by BMW AG , Daimler AG , Ford Motor Co and Volkswagen with its Audi and Porsche brands, the companies said in a statement.

Anxiety over whether battery-powered cars have the range to reach their destination is inhibiting some drivers from switching from traditional petrol- or diesel-powered models.

But with U.S. all-electric challenger Tesla stealing a lead, established brands are teaming up to ensure that electric vehicles (EVs) can get quickly back on the road after hooking up to a High-Power Charging (HPC) station.

"The first pan-European HPC network plays an essential role in establishing a market for electric vehicles," IONITY's CEO Michael Hajesch said. He added that the fast-charging stations would also offer digital-payment capability.

IONITY, to be headquartered in Munich, will open its first 20 charging stations to the public this year in Germany, Norway and Austria. These would be 120 km (75 miles) apart, and run in partnership with Tank & Rast, Circle K and OMV .

The network will be expanded to 100 stations in 2018, each one enabling several drivers of different car brands to charge their vehicles at the same time.

Each charging point will have a capacity of 350 kW, and will use the an existing European standard, the Combined Charging System, to reduce charging times compared to existing systems. The system is not tied to brands, which should make EVs more appealing to drivers, IONITY said.

UPDATE 4-U.S. House Republicans propose to scrap $7,500 electric vehicle credit - Reuters News

{{20171102T192559.589+0000}}UPDATE 4-U.S. House Republicans propose to scrap $7,500 electric vehicle credit(Adds Nissan reaction)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - House Republicans are proposing to eliminate the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles, which could hurt automakers like General Motors Co , Tesla Inc and Nissan Motor Co <7201.T>, according to the bill made public on Thursday.

Current law allows automakers to use the credit, which phases out after an automaker hits 200,000 plug-in vehicles sold. Electric vehicles have expensive batteries that make them pricier than gasoline-powered vehicles.

Environmental groups and an auto industry trade group blasted the proposal, which would kick in at the end of this year. GM vowed to fight, saying the credits are "an important customer benefit that can help accelerate the acceptance of electric vehicles." Tesla declined to comment.

Nissan said it supports continuing the tax credit and noted it has "made significant investments in the development of market-leading electric vehicles."

Critics of the credit say electric vehicle buyers tend to be wealthier than average and do not need subsidies.

Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing GM, Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Volkswagen AG and others, said the change could hurt electric vehicle sales.

"The potential elimination of the federal electric vehicle tax credit will impact the choices of prospective buyers and make the electric vehicle mandate in 10 states - about a third of the market - even more difficult to meet," Bergquist said.

"The EV tax credit repeal would cede U.S. leadership in clean vehicles, putting our companies at a competitive disadvantage and threatening jobs while costing drivers more at the pump and increasing pollution," said Luke Tonachel, director of the National Resources Defense Council's Clean Vehicles and Fuels Project.

Automakers have invested billions in electric vehicles and announced plans to shift significant production to plug-in models.

Former President Barack Obama unsuccessfully proposed hiking the tax credit for electric vehicles to $10,000 and converting it to a point-of-sale rebate.

GM shares fell 1.2 percent in late trading, while Tesla was down 7 percent after reporting earnings.

The House GOP plan also calls for repealing and phasing out other energy tax credits, including production and investment tax credit for solar, geothermal, fuel cell, wind energy and other clean energy projects.

Automakers face mandates from California and a dozen other states to produce a rising number of zero-emission vehicles and have said the credits are essential to meeting requirements.

GM's electric Chevrolet Bolt starts around $30,000 including the tax credit but rises to $37,500 without it.

Study predicts slow, steady rise of electric vehicles to 2030 - Reuters News

{{20171102T184035.755+0000}}Study predicts slow, steady rise of electric vehicles to 2030By Paul Lienert

DETROIT, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Pure electric vehicles will not begin to gain serious traction in most global markets until after 2025 and will likely account for only 14 percent of total global vehicle production by 2030, according to a study released on Thursday by Boston Consulting Group.

By then, the study's authors said, improved battery technology, lower costs and government mandates will drive greater consumer demand for EVs, which this year will account for less than 1 percent of the nearly 100 million vehicles sold worldwide and only 6 percent by 2025.

"Eventually, we'll reach a point where we don't need incentives anymore" to boost EV sales, said Xavier Mosquet, BCG senior partner and lead author of the study. By 2030, Mosquet said, EV demand will be driven by market forces, not regulation.

Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have already proposed eliminating one of the biggest EV incentives, a $7,500 tax credit, which could hurt automakers like General Motors Co , Tesla Inc and Nissan Motor Co <7201.T> that are selling large numbers of those vehicles. [nL2N1N81A8]

BCG expects battery costs to fall rapidly after 2020, to as low as $80 per kilowatt-hour by 2025, compared with about $150 today and more than $650 in 2010.

Total operating costs also will drop, BCG said, until the cost of owning and operating an electric vehicle over 10 years will fall below that of a comparable combustion-engine vehicles by 2021.

In addition, more stringent environmental targets in many countries will push vehicle manufacturers to add some form of electrification, including hybrid electric-gasoline powertrains, to reduce exhaust emissions after 2020.

Even as costs drop and more advanced technology is introduced over the next 12 years, BCG said it expects 86 percent of new vehicles to continue using some form of combustion engine by 2030.

Mosquet said a gradual shift to ride sharing in big cities and larger metropolitan areas, especially in the United States, will drive demand for EVs, in large part because the shared vehicles will accumulate miles more rapidly and thus narrow the gap in operating costs with combustion-engine vehicles.

Likewise, a shift to self-driving vehicles, particularly in ride-sharing fleets, will boost EV demand after 2025. The cost per mile for a battery-powered self-driving vehicle could drop as low as 74 cents by 2030, making such vehicles less expensive than those with combustion engines, BCG said.

FOKUS 4-Steuerpläne der Republikaner beflügeln Wall Street nicht - Reuters (German)

* Entscheidung über künftige Fed-Spitze am Abend erwartet

* Facebook überzeugt Anleger nicht

(neu: Fokus auf Wall Street mit aktuellen Kursen)

New York, 02. Nov (Reuters) - Die Wall Street hat auf die Steuerpläne der US-Republikaner verhalten reagiert. Der Dow Jones<.DJI> mit den 30 Standardwerten notierte am Donnerstag im New Yorker Mittagshandel 0,1 Prozent höher bei 23.461 Punkten, während der breiter aufgestellte S&P 500<.SPX> um 0,1 Prozent auf 2575 Stellen sank. Beim Nasdaq<.IXIC> betrug das Minus 0,2 Prozent auf 6704 Zähler. In Frankfurt hatte der Dax<.GDAXI> 0,2 Prozent auf 13.440 Punkte nachgegeben.

Die Steuerpläne der Republikaner fielen weitgehend so aus wie erwartet. Sie wollen die Unternehmenssteuer von 35 Prozent auf 20 Prozent senken.[nL8N1N82TC] Zudem soll es weniger Steuersätze für Privatleute geben. Die Pläne von Präsident Donald Trump haben seit seiner Wahl vor einem Jahr zur Rally an der Wall Street beigetragen. Allerdings gibt es Zweifel, ob dem Kongress die erste große Steuerreform seit 1986 gelingen wird. "Ich weiß nicht, ob aus Washington wirklich so viel Substanz kommt, dass die Erwartungen des Marktes erfüllt werden", sagte der Chef der Firma Longbow Asset Management, Jake Dollarhide.

Aufmerksam verfolgen werden die Investoren am Abend (20.00 Uhr MEZ) die Ankündigung Trumps, wen er für den Chefposten bei der US-Notenbank nominieren wird. Es wird erwartet, dass Fed-Direktor Jerome Powell Nachfolgerin von Janet Yellen wird. Er unterstützt ihre Geldpolitik größtenteils, gilt aber als marktfreundlicher.[nL8N1N8304]

Bei den Einzelwerten sorgten Quartalsbilanzen für Katerstimmung. So gaben die Papiere von Tesla um 7,8 Prozent nach, weil der Elektroautobauer das Produktionsziel für seinen Hoffnungsträger Model 3 um mehrere Monate verschieben muss.[nL8N1N81V8]

Aktien von Facebook belasteten mit einem Rückgang um 2,3 Prozent den S&P. Die Betreiberin des größten sozialen Netzes konnte zwar den Gewinn um fast 80 Prozent steigern, stimmte Anleger aber auf steigende Kosten für die Sicherheit ein.[nL8N1N80L0][nL8N1N87DP]

Dagegen stiegen Apple-Anteilsscheine um 0,5 Prozent. Der iPhone-Hersteller will nach Börsenschluss seine Quartalsbilanz veröffentlichen.

UPDATE 2-Tesla must stop overpromising, could need more finance -analysts - Reuters News

{{20171102T163513.893+0000}}UPDATE 2-Tesla must stop overpromising, could need more finance -analysts(Adds more comment, changes in analysts recommendations since May)

By Arjun Panchadar

Nov 2 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc shares fell more than 6 percent on Thursday on concern that the carmaker's performance was consistently falling short of chief executive Elon Musk's promises, while several analysts argued it could need more financing soon.

Four major houses - including Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan - cut their price targets by $5-$10 after the electric carmaker reported its worst ever quarterly loss and pushed back production targets for its Model 3 vehicle by three months.

While shares in Silicon Valley star Musk's venture were still up 50 percent for the year, reflecting faith in its positioning as a major future manufacturer, the company's share price has now retreated 23 percent since mid-September.

"Tesla needs to slow down and more narrowly focus its vision and come up for a breath of fresh air," Cowen and Co analysts said in a note. "Elon Musk needs to stop over promising and under delivering."

Wall Street's ratings on Tesla remain largely as they have been for most of this year. Only 7 of 24 brokerages rate it a "sell", up from 6 of 21 in May; 8 houses still recommend buying the stock compared to 7 six months ago.

Most remained hopeful that Tesla can overcome the problems in the rampup of production of its more affordable Model 3 sedan that have dominated company statements in the past three months.

But analysts were more divided on Musk's assurances that the company was now on top of the Model 3 issues and well-capitalised for the extra investment needed to resolve them. [nL2N1N72DJ]

"With Tesla's cash drain growing and production and gross margin visibility low, we see TSLA as a show me story," Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said in a note. "(It) is clearly still struggling with production issues."

He rates the stock "market-perform" but with a price target of $265, $35 below its current market price.

Goldman analysts, who already recommend selling Tesla shares, zeroed in on Musk's estimate that the company would not start spending heavily on future production in China before 2019, saying investors had expected the company to produce in the Chinese market within one to two years.

They said Musk would have to raise more capital in the second quarter of next year.

REFILE-Tesla must stop overpromising, could need more finance -analysts - Reuters News

{{20171102T132421.839+0000}}REFILE-Tesla must stop overpromising, could need more finance -analysts(Fixes typo in Silicon Valley in second paragraph)

Nov 2 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc was set to open more than 6 percent below the previous close on Thursday after it spooked investors with its biggest quarterly loss yet and a delay in production targets for its Model 3 vehicle by about three months.

After a year which has seen shares in Silicon Valley star Elon Musk's venture rise 50 percent on faith in its positioning as a major future carmaker and manufacturer, analysts expressed doubt over Musk's communication with markets and one - Nomura's Romit Shah - said the company could need more financing.

"Tesla needs to slow down and more narrowly focus its vision and come up for a breath of fresh air," Cowen and Co analysts said in a note. "Elon Musk needs to stop over promising and under delivering."

Tesla said bottlenecks in the rampup of production of the more affordable Model 3 sedan, widely seen as crucial to the company's future profitability, stemmed from its battery module assembly line at its Nevada Gigafactory, where Tesla had to redesign part of the production process. [nL2N1N72DJ]

It now expects to build 5,000 Model 3s per week by the end of the first quarter of 2018 from its original target date of December.

Some analysts were encouraged by the detail Tesla provided about the battery and production issues and expressed confidence in its ability to fix the problems.

But they were more divided on the company's promise that it was now on top of the Model 3 issues and well-capitalised for the extra investment needed to resolve them.

"While we expect that increased Model 3 production will provide a meaningful injection of liquidity on a number of fronts, Tesla runs the risk of requiring financing over the next few quarters, particularly if Model 3 production continues to undershoot expectations," Nomura Instinet analyst Romit Shah said in a note on the results.

He added that the market would continue to support Tesla's capital requirements.

Wall Street is now cautious on the stock in general, with 8 of 24 brokerages rating it "Buy" or higher, 9 "Hold" and 7 "Sell" or lower.

FOKUS 1-Tesla kämpft mit Produktionspannen - Rekordverlust - Reuters (German)

{{20171102T113232.096+0000}}FOKUS 1-Tesla kämpft mit Produktionspannen - Rekordverlust(Durchweg neu mit Analysten)

* US-Elektroautobauer verschiebt Produktionsziel um drei Monate

* Probleme bei der Batterieproduktion

* Musk: "Wir haben das im Griff"

San Francisco, 02. Nov (Reuters) - Das Model 3 gilt als Hoffnungsträger des US-Elektroautobauers Tesla. Mit dem Wagen will das aufstrebende Unternehmen aus dem Silicon Valley den Sprung aus der Nische eines Herstellers batteriebetriebener Luxusfahrzeuge in den Massenmarkt schaffen. Doch Tesla bekommt die Probleme bei dem Fahrzeug nicht in den Griff: Das Unternehmen muss seine Produktionsziele verschieben und schreibt im dritten Quartal einen Rekordverlust. Statt schon im Dezember, könne die Fertigung des wichtigen Model 3 erst drei Monate später auf wöchentlich 5000 Fahrzeuge hochgefahren werden, kündigte Firmenchef Elon Musk am Mittwoch nach Börsenschluss an. Damit verliert Tesla wichtige Zeit. Investoren reagierten verschreckt. Denn die Konkurrenz sitzt Tesla bereits im Nacken. Die Aktie gab im nachbörslichen Handel fast fünf Prozent nach.

Im dritten Quartal liefen statt der versprochenen 1500 Elektrowagen vom Typ Model 3 nur 260 Stück von den Bändern. Als Achillesferse stellte sich die Produktion der Batterie-Module heraus, für die Tesla in der Wüste von Nevada eigens eine große Fabrik hochgezogen hat. Dort müssen die Fertigungsabläufe den Angaben zufolge teilweise überarbeitet werden. Er sei angesichts der Probleme vor drei, vier Wochen deprimiert gewesen, räumte Musk ein. Inzwischen sei er jedoch wieder optimistisch, da klar sei, was zu tun ist. "Wir haben es erkannt, wir haben das im Griff", sagte der umtriebige Milliardär.

MEHR ALS EINE MARKETINGABTEILUNG

Analysten zeigten sich skeptisch: "Ich glaube, dass es bei Tesla noch die oder andere negative Überraschung geben wird", sagte Frank Schwope von der NordLB. Es sei noch nicht erwiesen, ob das Model 3 und die Batterien ausgereift seien. "Tesla vermarktet sich sehr gut. Dem Unternehmen wurde bisher viel verziehen. Ich glaube, dass irgendwann die Zeit kommt, wo Tesla mehr sein muss als eine Marketingabteilung." Kunden, die für die Bestellung eines der begehren Model 3 eine Anzahlung gemacht haben, könnten angesichts der Produktionsverzögerungen nervös werden.

Sein Kollege Marc-Rene Tonn vom Bankhaus M.M. Warburg ergänzte, Tesla müsse erkennen, dass es nicht allein auf die blumige Ankündigung ankomme. Das Unternehmen müsse das Versprochene auch auf die Straße bringen. "Da sieht man, dass das etwas schwieriger ist." Das Unternehmen aus Kalifornien hatte erst unlängst die Präsentation seines Elektro-Lasters "Tesla semi" um einige Wochen auf Mitte November verschoben.[nL8N1MH5DV]

Wegen der Probleme bei Model 3 verbrennt das ohnehin Verluste schreibende Unternehmen noch mehr Geld. Im abgelaufenen Quartal belief sich der Fehlbetrag auf 619 Millionen Dollar. Der Umsatz stieg zugleich um 30 Prozent auf knapp drei Milliarden Dollar. Musk sagte, Tesla verfüge über ausreichend Kapital, um die Verzögerungen zu überbrücken. Ende September verfügte das Unternehmen über Barmittel von 3,5 Milliarden Dollar. Zur Jahresmitte 2017 waren es noch etwas mehr als drei Milliarden.

Tesla hat mit der Sportlimousine Model S und dem Geländewagen Model X der Konkurrenz das Fürchten gelehrt. Das Model 3 kostet mit 35.000 Dollar nur halb so viel wie das Flagschiff Model S, wodurch sich der Druck auf die traditionellen Hersteller erhöht. Inzwischen haben alle großen Autokonzerne Elektroautos angekündigt, die in den nächsten Jahren auf den Markt kommen sollen. Autobauer wie Volkswagen, Daimler und BMW stehen unter Zugzwang, weil sie die schärferen Klimavorgaben erfüllen müssen. Hinzu kommt, dass der Diesel wegen der Abgasschummelei in Verruf geraten ist. Auf den Selbstzünder hatten vor allem die deutschen Hersteller gesetzt, um den CO2-Ausstoß zu verringern.

TOKYO, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Kobe Steel Ltd's <5406.T> admission that it fabricated specifications on some of its aluminium, copper and other products has left about 500 affected companies scrambling to pin down the potential impact.

UPDATE 5-Tesla stock falls on Model 3 delays, biggest-ever quarterly loss - Reuters News

{{20171102T000930.143+0000}}UPDATE 5-Tesla stock falls on Model 3 delays, biggest-ever quarterly loss(Adds detail on capital expenditure in quarter throughout)

By Alexandria Sage and Arjun Panchadar

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc on Wednesday pushed back its target for volume production on its new Model 3 sedan by about three months, saying it was difficult to predict how long it would take to fix all production bottlenecks.

The company also reported its biggest quarterly loss ever, sending shares down nearly 5 percent after hours as the loss was bigger than analysts had expected.

Tesla, led by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Elon Musk, faces a crucial test in its growth strategy as it ramps up production of the Model 3, its new sedan that starts at $35,000, about half the price of its flagship Model S. [nL3N1KK05W]

Although Tesla has made inroads among luxury car buyers with the advanced technology and innovative design in its Model S sedan and Model X SUV, it is the Model 3 on which its long-term viability rests. The company continues to burn through cash, and spent $1.1 billion in capital expenditures in the third quarter.

The company said it now expects to build 5,000 Model 3s per week by late in the first quarter of 2018 from its original target date of December.

Tesla said the main constraint was its battery module assembly line at its Nevada Gigafactory, where the company had to redesign part of the production process.

"I was really depressed about three or four weeks ago," Musk said, adding that he is now optimistic because it is clear what needs to be done. "We are on it, we've got it covered," but it will take a few months longer than expected, he said.

The Palo Alto, California-based company made just 260 Model 3 sedans in the third quarter due to what it called "production bottlenecks." It had planned to build more than 1,500. [nL4N1MD4G4]

Model 3 production delays mean postponed sales could exacerbate the company's cash burn. The problems could also worry the over 500,000 customers who have put down a refundable deposit on the car.

Adding to the pressure is the fact that U.S. tax credits for Tesla buyers, intended to help manufacturers ramp up electric vehicles, begin to expire after the company sells its 200,000th vehicle in the United States. The company has not said when that will be, but it has sold 250,000 globally.

Shares of Tesla have fallen nearly 17 percent from a 12-month high of $385 in September, but are still up 50 percent from January fueled by belief in the long-term prospects of the company.

Tesla's soaring stock has made the company the second-most valuable U.S. automaker behind General Motors Co , which had annual net profit of $9.4 billion in 2016.

LARGEST-EVER LOSS

Tesla could face major new requirements for cash given Model 3 problems, a possible factory in China, and plans to develop other vehicles, including an electric heavy duty truck.

But Musk said he did not expect any significant capital expenditures for China until 2019, adding that he envisions a factory producing at least a couple hundred thousand vehicles per year for the Chinese market.

Tesla said it was "well capitalized" for the delayed Model 3 production schedule and predicted capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the fourth quarter. That, together with spending in the third quarter, matched Tesla's August estimate of $2 billion in capital expenditures for the second half of the year.

Tesla reported that cash and cash equivalents rose to $3.53 billion on Sept. 30 from $3.04 billion at the end of the second quarter, but Tesla in August raised $1.8 billion by selling debt. It also spent $325 million to repay a credit facility in the quarter. [nL1N1KT12M]

The price of the $1.8 billion eight-year junk bond <88160RAE1=> issued by Tesla last August also fell after the quarterly report.

Tesla's continued need for cash is exacerbated by Musk's insistence on vertical integration, such as making its own batteries and selling cars directly to customers. That, industry experts say, is among the reasons Tesla is nowhere close to its aggressive goal of building 500,000 vehicles annually by next year, most of them Model 3s. [nL2N1MY1N0]

Tesla posted a net loss of $619.4 million, or $3.70 per share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 compared with a profit of $21.9 million, or 14 cents per share, a year earlier. (http://bit.ly/2lF0H65)

Revenue rose 30 percent to $2.98 billion. Excluding items, the company lost $2.92 per share.

Tesla warned that its adjusted gross margin would decline to about 15 percent due to a higher mix of lower-margin Model 3 deliveries in the fourth quarter, but then recover in the first quarter of 2018.

Last month, Tesla reported it delivered 26,150 vehicles in the third quarter, a 4.5 percent rise on the same period of 2016. [nL4N1MD4G4]

LEAD 1-Retards de production et perte historique pour Tesla - Reuters (French)

{{20171101T230459.451+0000}}LEAD 1-Retards de production et perte historique pour Tesla(Actualisé tout du long)

par Alexandria Sage

SAN FRANCISCO, 1er novembre (Reuters) - Tesla a repoussé mercredi d'environ trois mois son objectif de production pour sa berline Model 3, tout en jugeant difficile de prédire le temps qu'il faudra pour régler tous les problèmes.

Le constructeur de voitures électriques a en outre fait état de la plus forte perte trimestrielle de son histoire.

Ces deux annonces ont fait chuter le titre de près de 5% dans les transactions après la clôture à Wall Street.

L'entreprise fondée par Elon Musk est confrontée à un test important dans sa stratégie de croissance avec la montée en cadence programmée de la production de la Model 3, sa nouvelle berline vendue à un prix d'entrée de gamme de 35.000 dollars, soit à peu près moitié moins que la Model S.

Cette dernière et le SUV Model X ont permis à Tesla de percer sur le marché des voitures haut de gamme avec leurs innovations technologiques mais la viabilité à long terme du constructeur dépend en grande partie de la Model 3.

Tesla s'attend désormais à parvenir à un rythme de production de 5.000 Model 3 par semaine vers la fin du premier trimestre 2018 alors qu'il comptait jusqu'à présent atteindre cet objectif en décembre.

Le constructeur a précisé qu'il rencontrait ses principales difficultés sur sa ligne d'assemblage de batteries dans sa "Gigafactory" dans le Nevada, où il a dû redéfinir partiellement son processus de production.

Il n'a assemblé que 260 berlines Model 3 au troisième trimestre en raison de "goulots d'étranglement dans la production", alors qu'il prévoyait d'en sortir plus de 1.500.

Ces problèmes de production pourraient entraîner des retards de livraisons susceptibles d'aggraver sa consommation de trésorerie, que Tesla estime à un milliard de dollars sur le trimestre à venir. Ils pourraient aussi inquiéter les plus de 500.000 clients qui ont versé un acompte remboursable en réservant le véhicule.

BESOIN DE LIQUIDITÉS

Le besoin de liquidités de Tesla est exacerbé par l'accent mis par Elon Musk sur l'intégration verticale, qui amène le constructeur à fabriquer lui-même ses batteries et à vendre directement ses voitures à ses clients. Pour les experts du secteur automobile, cela explique en partie pourquoi Tesla est encore très loin d'atteindre son objectif ambitieux de construire 500.000 véhicules par an dès 2018, dont une majorité de Model 3.

Tesla a enregistré une perte nette de 619,4 millions de dollars (532,8 millions d'euros) au troisième trimestre, soit 3,70 dollars par action, contre un bénéfice de 21,9 millions (BPA 14 cents) un an plus tôt.

Hors exceptionnels, le constructeur a subi une perte de 2,92 dollars par action.

Le chiffre d'affaires a en revanche progressé de 30% à 2,98 milliards de dollars.

Tesla a prévenu que sa marge brute allait se contracter d'environ 15% au quatrième trimestre en raison du poids croissant de la Model 3, dont la marge est plus faible, mais qu'elle allait se redresser au premier trimestre 2018.

L'action Tesla a chuté de près de 17% depuis un pic d'un an à 385 dollars touché en septembre. Elle affiche toujours une hausse de 50% depuis le début de l'année, les investisseurs continuant de croire aux perspectives à long terme du constructeur.

Cette progression a permis à Tesla de devenir le numéro deux du secteur aux Etats-Unis par la capitalisation boursière, derrière General Motors , qui a dégagé en 2016 un bénéfice net de 9,4 milliards de dollars.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Parts makers offer safer Auto 2.0 bets than Tesla - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20171101T212619.933+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Parts makers offer safer Auto 2.0 bets than Tesla(The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions expressed are their own.)

By Antony Currie and Quentin Webb

NEW YORK/HONG KONG, Nov 1 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Buy the battery, not the car, the market seems to be suggesting. Investors have long regarded Elon Musk's Tesla as the best vehicle for betting on the electric and autonomous car revolution. But that has driven shares to an outlandish valuation even though the firm routinely loses money, misses production targets and faces increased competition. Components makers may pave a less volatile road to Auto 2.0 riches.

The company's latest quarterly figures, released after markets closed on Wednesday, underscore the gap between its promise and reality. Its third-quarter loss of $619 million was its worst ever. Tesla also pushed back its target date for boosting production of its mass-market Model 3 to 5,000 a week by about three months, to late in the first quarter of 2018.

Even ahead of that announcement, the trade to other EV plays appeared to be under way. Shares in Panasonic <6752.T>, which teamed up with Tesla to build its battery-producing Gigafactory in Nevada, have surged by almost 73 percent in the past 12 months, according to Thomson Reuters data. Another battery supplier, South Korea's LG Chem <051910.KS>, has risen 69.5 percent. Throwing in dividends adds 3 percentage points to each company's return. Tesla, meanwhile, has risen almost 69 percent.

Logic suggests that performance gap should widen. Tesla's shares trade at a whopping 56 times estimated 2019 earnings, the first year it is expected to turn a profit. That doesn't just price in Musk's aim of building 500,000 cars a year by the end of 2018, a goal that risks receding. It assumes Tesla keeps growing and cranks out margins common for tech companies but way out of reach for conventional automakers.

Panasonic and LG Chem, by contrast, trade at a far more reasonable 16 and 14 times estimated earnings for calendar year 2019, respectively. And they have a more diverse revenue stream. Both supply batteries to a number of other carmakers. General Motors' all-electric Bolt, which last month outsold Tesla's S and X for the first time, may be LG Chem's best-known customer. It also sells to Ford and the Renault-Nissan <7201.T> alliance. Both supply cheaper batteries for hybrid gasoline-electric cars, too.

Neither company is a pure play on the car industry. The sector accounted for just under a fifth of LG's third-quarter revenue and slightly less of Panasonic's top line in its fiscal second quarter. That may add an extra buffer to investors wary of taking too much risk. For the Tesla faithful, though, such logic holds no charge.

CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Tesla reports biggest-ever quarterly loss, Model 3 delays - Reuters News

{{20171101T205659.522+0000}}CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Tesla reports biggest-ever quarterly loss, Model 3 delays(Corrects Model 3 target to weekly from monthly, removes erroneous repeated text)

Nov 1 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc racked up a $619 million loss in the third quarter, its biggest-ever, driving its shares sharply lower as the electric-car maker spends to speed up production of its more affordable Model 3 sedan.

The company, led by Silicon Valley star Elon Musk, also confirmed it had missed its Model 3 production goal for the third quarter, producing only 260 vehicles compared to an earlier estimate of 1,500.

Its shares fell 5.4 percent in after hours trading.

The company said it had $3.53 billion in cash and cash-equivalents as of Sept. 30, compared to $3.04 billion at the end of the second quarter.

Tesla said last month it delivered 26,150 vehicles in the third quarter, a 4.5 percent rise on the same period of 2016, but added that "production bottlenecks" had left the company behind its planned ramp-up for the $35,000 Model 3. [nL4N1MD4G4]

On Wednesday it said it now hoped to achieve a production rate of 5,000 per week by the end of the first quarter of next year, pushed back from the end of this year.

It said automotive gross margin, which excludes the sale of zero emission vehicle (ZEV) credits, fell to 18.7 percent from 25 percent last year. Analysts on average had expected margins of 18.4 percent, according to FactSet.

Tesla posted a net loss of $619.4 million, or $3.70 per share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 compared to a profit of $21.9 million, or 14 cents per share, a year earlier. (http://bit.ly/2lF0H65)

Revenue rose 30 percent to $2.98 billion. Excluding items, the company lost $2.92 per share.

{{20171101T202229.861+0000}}Tesla reports biggest-ever quarterly lossNov 1 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc reported its biggest-ever quarterly loss on Wednesday as the electric-car maker spent more to speed up production of its more affordable Model 3 sedan.

Led by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Elon Musk, Tesla is struggling to overcome production bottlenecks as it builds the Model 3, seen as key to the company's long-term profitability.

The company said in October it missed its Model 3 production goal for the third quarter, producing only 260 vehicles compared with an earlier target of 1,500, and Musk said last month the car was "deep in production hell".

Tesla posted a net loss of $619.4 million, or $3.70 per share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 30 compared to a profit of $21.9 million, or 14 cents per share, a year earlier. (http://bit.ly/2lF0H65)

Revenue rose to $2.98 billion from $2.30 billion.

Luxury auto brands are scrambling to avoid a Blue U.S. Christmas - Reuters News

{{20171101T193642.833+0000}}Luxury auto brands are scrambling to avoid a Blue U.S. ChristmasBy Nick Carey

DETROIT, Nov 1 (Reuters) - When financial markets surge to new records, sales of luxury cars usually rise, too. Instead, October U.S. auto sales reports on Wednesday showed that a collapse in sales of luxury sedans is accelerating.

Consumers have gradually shifted over to luxury sport utility vehicles from sedans in the last decade, but the trend - which has occurred in both the non-luxury and luxury segments of the auto market - was particularly pronounced in October.

Sales of Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz S-Class, long a global benchmark for large, premium sedans, plunged 49 percent in October, and are down 24.8 percent for the year to date. General Motors Co's Cadillac brand said it sold just 779 of its CTS sedans in October. Demand for that car, designed to compete with German luxury sedans, is down nearly 33 percent for the year.

Cadillac's best-selling model this year is the XT5 compact SUV, which has more than doubled sales from a year ago.

The shift within the luxury vehicle market away from sedans toward SUVs of all sizes is forcing some of the most prestigious brands to scramble to add SUV models to their lineups or boost SUV production to meet demand.

"In the short term, there will be pressure to add (consumer) incentives, cut production or both," said Cox Automotive analyst Michelle Krebs. "And we just don't see an end in sight to this trend."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> has been trading at all-time highs [.N], usually a good sign for luxury sedans, but as major automakers reported new U.S. vehicle sales for October on Wednesday [nL2N1N718J], sales for passenger cars continued their slide while luxury SUV and crossover sales rose again. (http://tmsnrt.rs/2inGn3Y)

According to Kelley Blue Book data, in 2007 luxury sedans made up 7.6 percent of U.S. new vehicle sales, while luxury SUVs made up 4.2 percent. Through September this year, luxury SUVs made up just over 7 percent of the market, compared with 4.9 percent for luxury sedans.

In the short term, luxury brands could use holiday season sales promotions to clear slow-selling sedans off dealer lots, analysts said. Toyota Motor Corp's <7203.T> Lexus brand said on Wednesday it will launch its "December to Remember" year-end sales promotion for the 18th straight year.

HIGH-MARGIN VEHICLES

Longer-term, luxury car makers have to restructure their model lineups, which have for decades reflected conventional thinking that the "flagship" of a luxury vehicle brand is a big sedan.

Industry executives and analysts said luxury brands will launch more SUVs. BMW AG and Mercedes-Benz are both expanding their U.S. sport utility vehicle plants.

Some luxury sedans will disappear from lineups, but not all. Lexus, for instance, is launching a redesigned version of its flagship LS sedan in the United States in 2018, starting at around $75,000.

Established luxury car brands must reckon with the impact of Tesla Inc's electric vehicles, which have redefined the boundaries for advanced technology.

Offering a little more horsepower is not enough to draw in many customers, said Scott Keogh, head of Audi's U.S. operations. "There really isn't a new stimulus" for owners of current models to trade in their vehicles, he said.

"Audi buyers ... want the latest and greatest," he said. That is one reason why the brand, owned by Volkswagen AG , plans to launch an electric sport utility in the United States by 2019.

Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions, said automakers are keen to encourage eager consumers to buy luxury SUVs and crossovers as those models face less stringent fuel regulations and are far more profitable than sedans.

"There's still a significant portion of the market that wants a car," Fiorani said, "but I'm sure there were people who preferred a horse to a car at one point."

Randy Parker, U.S. head of Nissan Motor Co Ltd's <7201.T> luxury Infiniti brand, said much depends on the U.S. economy and gasoline prices, but luxury brands "with a really robust SUV and crossover portfolio will ... win in the next few years."

As investment dollars shift to SUV models, poor performers among luxury sedans will "fall by the wayside" said Bill Rinna, senior manager for North American forecasts at consultancy LMC Automotive.

"Are some of your stalwarts going away?" he said. "I don't believe so."

UPDATE 3-U.S. trade panel recommends varying solar panel import restrictions - Reuters News

{{20171031T211808.035+0000}}UPDATE 3-U.S. trade panel recommends varying solar panel import restrictions(Adds analyst comments on market impact)

By David Lawder and Diane Bartz

WASHINGTON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Members of the U.S. International Trade Commission on Tuesday made three different recommendations for restricting solar cell and panel imports on Tuesday, giving President Donald Trump a range of choices to address injury to domestic producers.

The recommendations range from an immediate 35 percent tariff on all imported panels to a four-year quota system that allows the import of up to 8.9 gigawatts of solar cells and modules in the first year. The president's ultimate decision could have a major impact on the price of U.S. power generated by the sun.

Both supporters and critics of import curbs on solar products were disappointed by the proposals, which were unveiled at a public meeting in Washington.

Trade remedies were requested in a petition earlier this year by two small U.S. manufacturers that said they were unable to compete with cheap panels made overseas, mainly in Asia. The companies, Suniva Inc and the U.S. arm of Germany's SolarWorld AG , said Tuesday's recommendations did not go far enough to protect domestic producers.

"The ITC's remedy simply will not fix the problem the ITC itself identified," Suniva said in a statement. The company, which is majority owned by Hong Kong-based Shunfeng International Clean Energy <1165.HK>, filed the rare Section 201 petition nine days after seeking Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April. [nL1N1HY24T] It had sought a minimum price on panels of 74 cents a watt, nearly double their current cost.

One analyst said the stiffest remedy recommended, a 35 percent tariff on solar panels, would add about 10 percent to the cost of a utility-scale project but would have a negligible impact on the price of residential systems because panels themselves make up a small portion of their overall cost.

"It's not nearly the doomsday impact we were potentially expecting," said Camron Barati, a solar analyst with market research firm IHS Markit Technology.

But the top U.S. solar trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a statement on Tuesday that any tariffs would be "intensely harmful" to the industry. The group has lobbied heavily against import restrictions on the grounds that they would undermine a 70 percent drop in the cost of solar since 2010 that has made the technology competitive with fossil fuels.

The ITC will deliver its report to Trump by Nov. 13. He will have broad leeway to come up with his own alternative or do nothing at all. Since only two members agreed on the same restrictions, there was no majority recommendation from the four-member commission.

"There is still plenty to be worried about," said MJ Shiao, who follows the U.S. solar market for GTM Research.

Trump has vowed to protect U.S. manufacturers from low-priced imports, and U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has talked about tariff-rate quotas as a flexible way to protect some industries, allowing imports in as needed, but only up to a certain level before high tariffs kick in.

Commissioners David Johanson and Irving Williamson urged the president to impose an immediate 30 percent tariff on completed solar modules, to be lowered in subsequent years, and a tariff-rate quota on solar cells. Imports of cells in excess of one gigawatt would be subject to a 30 percent tariff that would decline after the first year.

ITC Chair Rhonda Schmidtlein recommended an immediate 35 percent four-year tariff on imported solar modules, with a four-year tariff rate quota on solar cells. This would impose a 30 percent tariff on imports exceeding 0.5 gigawatts and 10 percent on imports below that level. These tariffs would decline over a four-year period.

In the most lenient recommendation, Commissioner Meredith Broadbent said the president should impose a four-year quota system that allows for imports of up to 8.9 gigawatts of solar cells and modules in the first year.

Portugal planning free zones for drones, self-driving cars - Reuters News

{{20171031T140253.141+0000}}Portugal planning free zones for drones, self-driving carsBy Axel Bugge and Daniel Alvarenga

LISBON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Aiming to spur development of drones and self-driving vehicles, Portugal is planning to launch "free zones" with special regulations to allow testing of such technologies and attract investment in them, the industry secretary said.

Portugal has seen a sharp rise in technology start-ups in the past few years, helped by cheap property, well educated engineers and low wages following its 2011-14 debt crisis.[nL8N1CX7X3]

Hosting the Web Summit technology conference has helped. It opens next week in Lisbon for the second time.[nL8N1BX4B4]

Foreign investment in the sector helped propel economic growth in 2017 to its highest level in more than a decade and the government hopes new regulation can draw more companies.

"We are working a lot on the regulatory and legal aspects because this is really totally fundamental for opportunities in this area," Industry Secretary Ana Lehmann told Reuters in an interview.

"One of the areas we are working on has to do with technological free zones and drones is one of the areas we want to promote...another is autonomous vehicles."

Many countries are looking at how to allow companies to test new technologies.

In Britain, Amazon is carrying out special parcel delivery testing while Alphabet's Google has tested drone delivery technology in Australia under its "Project Wing".

The U.S. government last week approved a plan for expanded drone testing. [nL2N1N01VZ]

Lehmann said the Portuguese government was working carefully on the laws needed for such zones. The country restricted the use of drones this year to raise public security.

"We are studying some locations and what is needed...within a legal framework that is very careful because these technologies have an impact," she said. "This is a delicate topic and we want to do it properly."

Portuguese law currently does not allow the testing of self-driving cars on public roads.

Veniam is one of Portugal's leading technology companies. It has developed wireless networks for public transport and hopes to use that know-how for autonomous vehicles. Veniam first developed its system in the city of Porto, which Lehmann said was a "very interesting test case".

Mercedes-Benz this year opened a digital centre in Lisbon, which includes development of autonomous vehicle technology while Volkswagen has a big assembly plant in Portugal.

Portugal is also angling for a potential European factory under consideration at Tesla Motors. The country has one of Europe's biggest reserves of lithium.

"Lots of people are fighting, we are fighting (for a Tesla factory)," Lehmann said when asked about the possibility.
