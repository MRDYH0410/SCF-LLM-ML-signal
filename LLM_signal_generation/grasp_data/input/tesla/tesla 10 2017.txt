LMEWEEK-Electric cars set world's nickel miners on new course - Reuters News

{{20171031T121922.392+0000}}LMEWEEK-Electric cars set world's nickel miners on new course* Growing use of nickel, which allows longer charge, in batteries

* Not all nickel suitable for electric car batteries

* BHP, Sumitomo among first movers

By James Regan and Melanie Burton

SYDNEY/MELBOURNE, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Battery makers are increasingly turning to nickel to help power growing global electric car sales, but only half of the world's producers of the metal are likely to benefit, mining analysts and executives say.

Lithium batteries containing nickel, which helps keep a charge over longer distances, are being installed in electric cars from Tesla's top-of-the-line Model X to General Motors Co modestly-priced Chevy Bolt.

The battery boom promises a new and growing market for miners producing high-grade nickel products. However, half the world's supply of the metal, comprised of so-called ferronickel and nickel pig iron grades, is unsuitable for battery production, according to analysts at UBS.

Some of the biggest producers of the higher-grade ores, including BHP Norilsk Nickel , Vale and Sumitomo Corp <8053.T>, are moving quickly to take advantage and seal long-term supply deals with battery producers.

Smaller producers with ores suitable for batteries, such as Australia's Independence Group and Western Areas also stand to win.

These producers are building plants to convert the metal into a powder-like sulfate that is particularly suited for use in batteries. Sulfate nickel regularly fetches a price premium over London Metal Exchange-traded nickel.

"Not everyone will be a winner," said Dan Lougher, chief executive of Western Areas.

"We've met with quite a number of battery manufacturers, and they are quite specific on their requirements. Nickel is an important component of these batteries."

Among those losing out would be lower-grade nickel mines like Cerro Matoso in Columbia, owned by South32 Ltd and Glencore's Koniambo in New Caledonia, as well as Anglo American's mines in Brazil producing ferronickel.

"The market dynamics will change in the coming years as a result of electric vehicles," said Peter Bradford, chief executive of Independence Group Ltd , which is aiming to produce around 25,0000 tonnes of high-purity nickel this year from a new mine.

"Battery growth is going to disrupt the market," he said.

The big companies are already moving.

Norilsk, the world's biggest nickel miner, in June announced a tie-up with the German battery maker BASF . [nFWN1JO0EL]

Within a few weeks, BHP unveiled plans to retool its Nickel West division to start shipping nickel to battery manufacturers beginning in April 2019. [nL4N1KV3E8]

The announcement marked a turnaround for Nickel West, which two years ago was in its death throes, with its workforce of 2,000 told that their jobs would end in 2019. [nFWN1JO0EL]

Eduard Haegel, division chief of Nickel West, expects demand for electric vehicle batteries to account for about 90 percent of the division's annual output of 100,000 tonnes within the next six years.

Meanwhile, Vale is looking for a partner in its loss-making New Caledonia nickel complex. It has been in talks with the Chinese battery maker GEM Co <002340.SZ>, the Financial Times reported.

"If we are not successful, we'll have to face the reality, which is this operation is holding the company back," Luciano Siani Pires, Vale's chief financial officer, said, referring to the New Caledonian business.

Plants already shut may get a second chance, too.

Two with shots at restarting are Brazil's Votorantim Metais, and First Quantum Minerals's Ravensthorpe in Australia, which at today's nickel prices cannot compete but could be profitable if the market continues to climb.

NICKEL GROWTH SEEN

Benchmark prices on the London Metal Exchange have jumped 17 percent in the year to date to $11,725 per tonne, but remain well below the 2014 peak of more than $21,400, and over 75 percent off the all-time high of just over $51,000 in 2007.

In a sign of how much the electric car industry is changing the market, the London Metal Exchange this week said it may offer a nickel contract specifically targeting the battery market.

Manufacturing electric cars with high-driving ranges is fueling demand for nickel-rich batteries, according to Porsche . The German carmaker expects the ratio of nickel to cobalt and manganese in a typical battery to rise eight-fold as electric cars become more mainstream.

UBS estimates that 15 million electric vehicles will be on the road by 2025, lifting nickel demand by 300,000-900,000 tonnes, or by 10-40 percent of the current market.

UPDATE 1-Panasonic says Gigafactory battery output to increase for Tesla's Model 3 - Reuters News

{{20171031T111500.282+0000}}UPDATE 1-Panasonic says Gigafactory battery output to increase for Tesla's Model 3* Tesla said bottlenecks limited Model 3 production

* Tesla-Panasonic jointly operate battery plant

* Bottlenecks due to automation delays -Panasonic CEO

(Adds more Panasonic CEO comments, earnings, automotive expansion, details on China plant)

TOKYO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Panasonic Corp <6752.T> on Tuesday said output at the $5 billion battery "Gigafactory" it runs with electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc could soon increase as the causes of bottlenecks that have hobbled production are now understood.

Panasonic, the world's largest automotive lithium-ion battery manufacturer, makes battery cells to which Tesla adds electronics to make battery packs for its cars.

Tesla earlier this month blamed manufacturing bottlenecks for limiting quarterly production of its mass-market Model 3 sedan to 260 vehicles rather than its 1,500 goal. [nL4N1MH3QR]

Panasonic Chief Executive Kazuhiro Tsuga said at an earnings briefing that delays to the automation of the battery pack production line meant some stages had to be completed manually.

"This process (for battery packs) will be soon automated, and then the number of vehicles to be produced will rise sharply," Tsuga said. He declined to comment to what extent Model 3 production would be behind its targeted schedule.

The comments came as Panasonic on Tuesday said automotive demand helped July-September operating profit rise 6 percent, beating analyst estimates. It maintained its 335 billion yen ($2.96 billion) forecast for the year ending March. [nL4N1N63DO]

Analysts have said Panasonic's massive Gigafactory bet makes the firm highly sensitive to Tesla's strategy. On Tuesday, Tsuga acknowledged the bottlenecks could impact earnings, but said the contract with Tesla was designed to hedge various risks. He also said battery businesses with other clients are profitable.

Panasonic sees batteries as central to its plan to nearly double automotive business revenue to 2.5 trillion yen by the year through March 2022. To that end, it has been aggressively expanding battery production capacity globally. [nL4N1MA1YW]

It plans to start production this financial year ending March at a new plant in Dalian, China, and is adding production lines in Japan - steps that could allow it to reduce dependence on Tesla.

Noboru Sato, a former battery engineer at Honda Motor Co Ltd <7267.T> and former vice president of South Korean rechargeable battery maker Samsung SDI Co Ltd <006400.KS>, said Panasonic "decided to build the plant in China on requests from Honda and Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>."

Toyota and Honda, already customers of Panasonic batteries, were seeking ways of procuring batteries in China, Sato said, as the government in the world's largest automobile market promotes electric vehicles as a means of combating pollution.

"Panasonic's decision to produce batteries in China has solved their problems," Sato said.

Panasonic, Honda and Toyota declined to comment.

Panasonic's Q2 profit rises 6 pct on automotive demand, beats estimates - Reuters News

{{20171031T074832.839+0000}}Panasonic's Q2 profit rises 6 pct on automotive demand, beats estimatesTOKYO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Japan's Panasonic Corp <6752.T> reported a 6 percent increase in second-quarter operating profit on Tuesday, beating analyst estimates, as it began to tap growing demand for electrification from automakers.

The electronics maker said July-September profit rose to 112.7 billion yen ($939.79 million) from 106.3 billion yen a year earlier.

That compared with a Thomson Reuters Starmine SmartEstimate of 96.46 billion yen drawn from the forecasts of 10 analysts. SmartEstimates give greater weight to recent estimates by the more consistently accurate analysts.

Panasonic, the exclusive battery cell supplier for Tesla Inc's electric vehicles, maintained its 335 billion yen operating profit forecast for the year ending March, versus the 346.13 billion yen average of 21 analyst estimates.

The solid results come as Panasonic, the world's largest automotive lithium-ion battery manufacturer, is aggressively expanding battery production capacity globally. [nL4N1MA1YW]

It started mass production of battery cells at Tesla's Gigafactory in Nevada earlier this year and plans to follow suit at a new plant in Dalian, China. It is also adding new production lines in Japan.

{{20171030T191907.394+0000}}TIMELINE -The long power restoration process in Puerto RicoOct 30 (Reuters) - The following is a timeline of the efforts to restore power in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, which knocked out power to all 1.5 million homes and businesses on the island.

Sept. 6 - Hurricane Irma skirts by the northern side of Puerto Rico as a Category 5 storm, knocking power out to about 1 million homes and businesses on the island.

Sept. 6-20 - Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) restores power to all but about 60,000 customers after Irma and seeks companies that can help rebuild the grid. There are reports that about five companies participated in that request for proposals, including Whitefish Energy, based in Whitefish, Montana.

Sept. 20 - Hurricane Maria hits Puerto Rico as a Category 4 storm, knocking out all power on the island.

Sept. 22 - New York Power Authority (NYPA) sends 12 workers to help PREPA assess damage after Maria, as part of a group that traveled with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.

Sept. 26 - President Donald Trump increased the federal government's share of costs to 100 percent funding for debris removal and emergency protective measures, including emergency power restoration, for 180 days. The work will be authorized by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

Sept. 26 - Whitefish Energy Chief Executive Officer Andy Techmanski travels to Puerto Rico to talk to PREPA about what Whitefish can do to help restore power.

{{20171027T110001.932+0000}}RPT-ANALYSIS-Self-driving startups race down a narrowing road(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text)

By Paul Lienert and Jane Lanhee Lee

DETROIT/SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Lei Xu and Justin Song once worked at electric carmaker Tesla Inc , one of the hottest companies in Silicon Valley. But with interest and investments in autonomous vehicles mounting, they left to pursue what they see as the next big thing.

Their company, Nullmax, is one of more than 240 startups worldwide, including 75 in Silicon Valley, attempting to design software, hardware components and systems for future self-driving cars, according to a Reuters analysis.

Xu and Song are bankrolled by corporate money, but unlike many of their fellow entrepreneurs, they skipped funding from Silicon Valley venture capitalists. Founded in August 2016, Nullmax got $10 million from a Chinese firm, Xinmao Science and Technology Co <000836.SZ>.

By seeking corporate backing in China, the Nullmax founders managed to sidestep an issue facing other startups in the sector: While big automotive and technology companies are pouring billions into the autonomous vehicle space, Silicon Valley investors so far have been fairly restrained in increasing their bets.

Headlines have been dominated by old-line players such as General Motors Co , which jolted the industry last year when it bought a tiny San Francisco software company called Cruise Automation for a reported $1 billion. Just this week, top-tier supplier Delphi Automotive PLC acquired Boston-based software startup nuTonomy for $450 million. [nL2N1MZ0VE]

Now, "every startup thinks they will get a billion dollars" in valuation, said Evangelos Simoudis, a Silicon Valley venture investor and an advisor on corporate innovation.

However, investment in untested startup companies remains relatively modest despite all the buzz and lofty expectations. Total funding of self-driving startups from both corporate and private investors has barely topped $5 billion, the Reuters analysis of publicly available data shows.

With the notable exceptions of Andreessen Horowitz and New Enterprise Associates, few of the big Valley venture capital firms are heavily invested in the sector. Overall, only seven of the top 30 self-driving startups have received later-stage funding, the Reuters analysis shows, an indication that some venture capitalists are ambivalent about the industry's potential.

(For a graphic of venture and corporate funding of self-driving startups, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2xOX0jN)

Skeptics note that few of the startups are making money. And established auto and parts companies have not demonstrated a clear path to revenue and profitability in autonomous vehicles despite their big bets in the space.

Another sticking point: While the initial wave of self-driving vehicles is expected to begin commercial service in 2019-2020, experts expect the transition from human-driven to automated cars could take a decade or more to roll out.

Cautions Sergio Marchionne, chief executive officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles : "You can destroy a lot of value by chasing your tail in autonomous driving."

CORPORATE INVESTMENTS

All told, U.S. automotive and technology firms likely have invested some $40 billion to $50 billion in self-driving technology in recent years, mainly through acquisitions and partnerships. The full extent is hard to know because big players such as Alphabet Inc , whose Waymo subsidiary is considered among the front-runners in the arena, have not revealed the full scope of their investments, although it is believed to be in the billions.

Among the top corporate investors in the sector are Samsung Group [SAGR.UL], Intel Corp , Qualcomm Inc , Delphi and Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL]. Corporate investors also have backed five of the six self-driving startups with valuations of $1 billion or more.

(For a graphic on key players in the development of autonomous vehicles, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2nYv7gc)

Whether the industry is poised to produce more such unicorns is now a topic of much debate. Two former investors in Cruise Automation, for example, are poles apart in their views of self-driving vehicles and technology.

Veronica Wu, managing partner in Palo Alto-based Hone Capital, said her company continues to invest in "quite a number" of self-driving startups, while acknowledging that the technology will take time to deploy.

"It's a matter of when, not if," she said. "We're fairly optimistic."

In contrast, Sunny Dhillon of Signia Venture Partners, another Cruise investor, said his firm does not see any attractive investments in the sector right now.

The hefty price paid by GM for Cruise, he said, "made the space very frothy, with every computer vision and robotics PhD student seemingly emerging with a new self-driving car startup."

In addition, he said many established players "already have made their big investments (and) acquisitions" in the sector. That could limit investors' potential returns and entrepreneurs' payoffs down the road.

Quin Garcia, a partner in San Francisco-based AutoTech Ventures, concurs that the space is crowded and valuations are inflated. There may still be "a select few IPOs, but there will be many failures of autonomous vehicle startups" by 2021, he said.

NULLMAX IN CHINA

Those odds haven't deterred Nullmax founders Xu and Song, who are looking to differentiate themselves.

With many self-driving startups looking to supply U.S. and European automakers, the Chinese-born entrepreneurs, whose specialties are camera-based vision systems and artificial intelligence, are focused on China. They expect to deliver the first partially automated systems to Chinese automakers by 2020.

The U.S.-educated entrepreneurs, both 35, now work out of a small shop in Fremont, Calif., not far from Tesla's sprawling home factory. Xu once worked at Tesla as a senior engineer while Song specialized in supply chain and quality engineering. Tesla declined to confirm their prior employment.

Xu said the company employs about 50 people, most of them in a larger office in Shanghai. He said the company wants to keep a foot in California, which is a hub of U.S. tech talent, and where regulators have smoothed the way for testing of self-driving vehicles.

As for how Nullmax plans to cash out, Xu navigated around that question.

"We're pretty busy," he said. "We don't much time to think about an IPO right now."

DETROIT, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Wall Street may love the shares of Silicon Valley electric carmaker Tesla Inc , but Americans love big, fuel-thirsty trucks like Ford Motor Co's bestselling F-Series pickups and are paying ever higher prices to buy them.

The auto industry is at a crossroads, with the future of legacy automakers like Ford, General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV uncertain as governments float proposals to ban internal combustion engines over the next two decades.

But in the present, consumer enthusiasm for trucks and sport utility vehicles is strong, especially in the United States. And that is providing Ford, GM and other established automakers with billions in cash to mount a challenge to Tesla.

Tesla has ambitions to boost annual sales to 500,000 vehicles a year. But it is wrestling with the sort of production problems that old-line automakers have largely put behind them, and has reported a net loss of $666.7 million through the first six months of 2017. Analysts expect the company to post a third quarter net loss of $380.4 million when it reports results next Wednesday. [nL2N1N02OM]

Electric cars are money losers, which explains why global automakers have been slow to roll them out until now. But regulatory and consumer pressures are forcing established automakers to put more electric vehicles in their fleets over the next several years. In a cash-intensive industry, profits from pickups and SUVs may give them a competitive edge.

Ford said on Thursday that the average price of one of its F-series pickups rose $2,800 to an average $45,400 a truck in the third quarter. Sales of F-series trucks, which range from spartan work trucks to Platinum models with the features - and price tags - of a European luxury sedan, were up nearly 11 percent to 658,636 vehicles for the first nine months of this year.

GM has driven its share price up nearly 30 percent so far in 2017 as Chief Executive Mary Barra has talked up plans for putting self-driving, electric Chevrolet Bolts into ride services fleets within a few quarters.

Barra told investors on Tuesday improved profit margins on trucks were "one of the big drivers of the overall 8.3 percent margins" in the automaker's North American business during the latest quarter.

GM has forecast free cash flow for the full year of roughly $6 billion. That is $1 billion less than forecast earlier this year, but strong enough to fund the company's promise to develop 20 more electric vehicles by 2023 and send $7 billion back to shareholders. [nL2N1MD1YS]

GM, which emerged from a government funded bankruptcy eight years ago, now has $31.4 billion in available funds, including $17.3 billion in cash.

Ford lags behind GM in sales of battery electric models, but the company has said it will spend $5 billion developing battery electric and hybrid models. Ford's new Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett has said the plans include shifting $500 million into electric vehicle development from internal combustion projects. [nL4N1ME3GX]

Ford's share price has been flat for the year as the No. 2 U.S. automaker ushered out former CEO Mark Fields. Still, it had $28 billion in cash and marketable securities as of Sept. 30.

Automakers also are becoming more confident they can make money on electric cars as battery costs come down.

Volkswagen AG's Audi brand is gearing up a fleet of electric models that the company expects will account for 25 percent of sales by 2025. In the United States, Audi plans to launch an electric SUV "in the sweet spot of the market" in 2019, Scott Keogh, head of Audi's U.S. operations, told Reuters on Thursday.

Sales of Audi's current lineup of SUVs "pay for what we want to do, which is lead the future," Keogh said.

Renault SA Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn expressed confidence earlier this month that electric cars will become "a significant contributor to our performance." [nL8N1MH0QX]

Tesla, by comparison to its legacy rivals, is market value rich, and cash poor. It had $3 billion in cash on hand at the end of the second quarter, and some analysts predict the automaker will have to raise more to cover the expected cash drain from the slow launch of the Model 3, which is lower priced than other Teslas and aimed at the market for $35,000 to $45,000 cars.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has outlined ambitious plans to expand its network of factories and service facilities, including potentially an assembly plant in China and up to three more electric battery Gigafactories. He told investors in July the company could sell more shares to fund that expansion.

"I'm sure there will be some funding rounds that happen in the future," he said.

Renault SA Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn expressed confidence earlier this month that electric cars will become "a significant contributor to our performance." [nL8N1MH0QX]

Tesla, by comparison to its legacy rivals, is market value rich, and cash poor. It had $3 billion in cash on hand at the end of the second quarter, and some analysts predict the automaker will have to raise more to cover the expected cash drain from the slow launch of the Model 3, which is lower priced than other Teslas and aimed at the market for $35,000 to $45,000 cars.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has outlined ambitious plans to expand its network of factories and service facilities, including potentially an assembly plant in China and up to three more electric battery Gigafactories. He told investors in July the company could sell more shares to fund that expansion.

"I'm sure there will be some funding rounds that happen in the future," he said.

(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text)

By Paul Lienert and Jane Lanhee Lee

DETROIT/SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Lei Xu and Justin Song once worked at electric carmaker Tesla Inc , one of the hottest companies in Silicon Valley. But with interest and investments in autonomous vehicles mounting, they left to pursue what they see as the next big thing.

Their company, Nullmax, is one of more than 240 startups worldwide, including 75 in Silicon Valley, attempting to design software, hardware components and systems for future self-driving cars, according to a Reuters analysis.

Xu and Song are bankrolled by corporate money, but unlike many of their fellow entrepreneurs, they skipped funding from Silicon Valley venture capitalists. Founded in August 2016, Nullmax got $10 million from a Chinese firm, Xinmao Science and Technology Co <000836.SZ>.

By seeking corporate backing in China, the Nullmax founders managed to sidestep an issue facing other startups in the sector: While big automotive and technology companies are pouring billions into the autonomous vehicle space, Silicon Valley investors so far have been fairly restrained in increasing their bets.

Headlines have been dominated by old-line players such as General Motors Co , which jolted the industry last year when it bought a tiny San Francisco software company called Cruise Automation for a reported $1 billion. Just this week, top-tier supplier Delphi Automotive PLC acquired Boston-based software startup nuTonomy for $450 million. [nL2N1MZ0VE]

Now, "every startup thinks they will get a billion dollars" in valuation, said Evangelos Simoudis, a Silicon Valley venture investor and an advisor on corporate innovation.

However, investment in untested startup companies remains relatively modest despite all the buzz and lofty expectations. Total funding of self-driving startups from both corporate and private investors has barely topped $5 billion, the Reuters analysis of publicly available data shows.

With the notable exceptions of Andreessen Horowitz and New Enterprise Associates, few of the big Valley venture capital firms are heavily invested in the sector. Overall, only seven of the top 30 self-driving startups have received later-stage funding, the Reuters analysis shows, an indication that some venture capitalists are ambivalent about the industry's potential.

Skeptics note that few of the startups are making money. And established auto and parts companies have not demonstrated a clear path to revenue and profitability in autonomous vehicles despite their big bets in the space.

Another sticking point: While the initial wave of self-driving vehicles is expected to begin commercial service in 2019-2020, experts expect the transition from human-driven to automated cars could take a decade or more to roll out.

Cautions Sergio Marchionne, chief executive officer of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles : "You can destroy a lot of value by chasing your tail in autonomous driving."

CORPORATE INVESTMENTS

All told, U.S. automotive and technology firms likely have invested some $40 billion to $50 billion in self-driving technology in recent years, mainly through acquisitions and partnerships. The full extent is hard to know because big players such as Alphabet Inc , whose Waymo subsidiary is considered among the front-runners in the arena, have not revealed the full scope of their investments, although it is believed to be in the billions.

Among the top corporate investors in the sector are Samsung Group [SAGR.UL], Intel Corp , Qualcomm Inc , Delphi and Robert Bosch GmbH [ROBG.UL]. Corporate investors also have backed five of the six self-driving startups with valuations of $1 billion or more.

(For a graphic on key players in the development of autonomous vehicles, see: http://tmsnrt.rs/2nYv7gc)

Whether the industry is poised to produce more such unicorns is now a topic of much debate. Two former investors in Cruise Automation, for example, are poles apart in their views of self-driving vehicles and technology.

Veronica Wu, managing partner in Palo Alto-based Hone Capital, said her company continues to invest in "quite a number" of self-driving startups, while acknowledging that the technology will take time to deploy.

"It's a matter of when, not if," she said. "We're fairly optimistic."

In contrast, Sunny Dhillon of Signia Venture Partners, another Cruise investor, said his firm does not see any attractive investments in the sector right now.

The hefty price paid by GM for Cruise, he said, "made the space very frothy, with every computer vision and robotics PhD student seemingly emerging with a new self-driving car startup."

In addition, he said many established players "already have made their big investments (and) acquisitions" in the sector. That could limit investors' potential returns and entrepreneurs' payoffs down the road.

Quin Garcia, a partner in San Francisco-based AutoTech Ventures, concurs that the space is crowded and valuations are inflated. There may still be "a select few IPOs, but there will be many failures of autonomous vehicle startups" by 2021, he said.

NULLMAX IN CHINA

Those odds haven't deterred Nullmax founders Xu and Song, who are looking to differentiate themselves.

With many self-driving startups looking to supply U.S. and European automakers, the Chinese-born entrepreneurs, whose specialties are camera-based vision systems and artificial intelligence, are focused on China. They expect to deliver the first partially automated systems to Chinese automakers by 2020.

The U.S.-educated entrepreneurs, both 35, now work out of a small shop in Fremont, Calif., not far from Tesla's sprawling home factory. Xu once worked at Tesla as a senior engineer while Song specialized in supply chain and quality engineering. Tesla declined to confirm their prior employment.

Xu said the company employs about 50 people, most of them in a larger office in Shanghai. He said the company wants to keep a foot in California, which is a hub of U.S. tech talent, and where regulators have smoothed the way for testing of self-driving vehicles.

As for how Nullmax plans to cash out, Xu navigated around that question.

"We're pretty busy," he said. "We don't much time to think about an IPO right now."

ANALYSIS-Wall Street loves electric cars, America loves trucks - Reuters News

{{20171027T050002.872+0000}}ANALYSIS-Wall Street loves electric cars, America loves trucksBy Paul Lienert and Joseph White

DETROIT, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Wall Street may love the shares of Silicon Valley electric carmaker Tesla Inc , but Americans love big, fuel-thirsty trucks like Ford Motor Co's bestselling F-Series pickups and are paying ever higher prices to buy them.

The auto industry is at a crossroads, with the future of legacy automakers like Ford, General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV uncertain as governments float proposals to ban internal combustion engines over the next two decades.

But in the present, consumer enthusiasm for trucks and sport utility vehicles is strong, especially in the United States. And that is providing Ford, GM and other established automakers with billions in cash to mount a challenge to Tesla.

Tesla has ambitions to boost annual sales to 500,000 vehicles a year. But it is wrestling with the sort of production problems that old-line automakers have largely put behind them, and has reported a net loss of $666.7 million through the first six months of 2017. Analysts expect the company to post a third quarter net loss of $380.4 million when it reports results next Wednesday. [nL2N1N02OM]

Electric cars are money losers, which explains why global automakers have been slow to roll them out until now. But regulatory and consumer pressures are forcing established automakers to put more electric vehicles in their fleets over the next several years. In a cash-intensive industry, profits from pickups and SUVs may give them a competitive edge.

Ford said on Thursday that the average price of one of its F-series pickups rose $2,800 to an average $45,400 a truck in the third quarter. Sales of F-series trucks, which range from spartan work trucks to Platinum models with the features - and price tags - of a European luxury sedan, were up nearly 11 percent to 658,636 vehicles for the first nine months of this year.

GM has driven its share price up nearly 30 percent so far in 2017 as Chief Executive Mary Barra has talked up plans for putting self-driving, electric Chevrolet Bolts into ride services fleets within a few quarters.

Barra told investors on Tuesday improved profit margins on trucks were "one of the big drivers of the overall 8.3 percent margins" in the automaker's North American business during the latest quarter.

GM has forecast free cash flow for the full year of roughly $6 billion. That is $1 billion less than forecast earlier this year, but strong enough to fund the company's promise to develop 20 more electric vehicles by 2023 and send $7 billion back to shareholders. [nL2N1MD1YS]

GM, which emerged from a government funded bankruptcy eight years ago, now has $31.4 billion in available funds, including $17.3 billion in cash.

Ford lags behind GM in sales of battery electric models, but the company has said it will spend $5 billion developing battery electric and hybrid models. Ford's new Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett has said the plans include shifting $500 million into electric vehicle development from internal combustion projects. [nL4N1ME3GX]

Ford's share price has been flat for the year as the No. 2 U.S. automaker ushered out former CEO Mark Fields. Still, it had $28 billion in cash and marketable securities as of Sept. 30.

Automakers also are becoming more confident they can make money on electric cars as battery costs come down.

Volkswagen AG's Audi brand is gearing up a fleet of electric models that the company expects will account for 25 percent of sales by 2025. In the United States, Audi plans to launch an electric SUV "in the sweet spot of the market" in 2019, Scott Keogh, head of Audi's U.S. operations, told Reuters on Thursday.

Sales of Audi's current lineup of SUVs "pay for what we want to do, which is lead the future," Keogh said.

Renault SA Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn expressed confidence earlier this month that electric cars will become "a significant contributor to our performance." [nL8N1MH0QX]

Tesla, by comparison to its legacy rivals, is market value rich, and cash poor. It had $3 billion in cash on hand at the end of the second quarter, and some analysts predict the automaker will have to raise more to cover the expected cash drain from the slow launch of the Model 3, which is lower priced than other Teslas and aimed at the market for $35,000 to $45,000 cars.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has outlined ambitious plans to expand its network of factories and service facilities, including potentially an assembly plant in China and up to three more electric battery Gigafactories. He told investors in July the company could sell more shares to fund that expansion.

"I'm sure there will be some funding rounds that happen in the future," he said.

{{20171026T161411.191+0000}}UPDATE 1-UAW files complaint against Tesla for terminated workers(Adds Tesla's response)

Oct 26 (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers (UAW) International Union said on Thursday it filed a complaint against electric carmaker Tesla Inc on behalf of the company's terminated workers.

The unfair labor practice (ULP) charges were filed at the National Labor Relations Board's (NLRB) Oakland office, the union said.

Tesla in October fired about 400 employees including associates, team leaders and supervisors, Reuters reported, citing a former employee. [nL2N1MP02E]

Performance reviews can result in promotions and occasionally in employee departures and no action was taken based on their feelings on unionization, Tesla said in an email to Reuters on Thursday.

Roughly 20,000 ULPs are filed with the NLRB by unions like the UAW as an organizing tactic, the company said.

UAW said in February it will greet Tesla's Fremont, California, assembly plant workers with 'open arms' in a bid to unionize the factory.

NLRB, the U.S. agency in charge of enforcing labor law, in late August filed a complaint against Tesla, saying it found merit to workers' complaints about unfair labor practices. [nL4N1LH6WM]

Problemas com assentos pressionam estratégia de produção da Tesla - Reuters (Portuguese, Brazil)

{{20171026T154439.061+0000}}Problemas com assentos pressionam estratégia de produção da TeslaSAN FRANCISCO, 26 Out (Reuters) - Elon Musk estava irritado. A fabricação dos assentos do novo Model X, utilitário esportivo da Tesla , foi uma confusão. Um fornecedor estava tendo problemas para executar o design complicado, estimulando a frustração.

A montadora norte-americana nunca conseguiria produzir em massa o próximo Model 3, que pretende popularizar a Tesla, se não tiver algo tão fundamental como um assento?

Musk tomou uma decisão: a Tesla faria os próprios assentos.

O exigente presidente-executivo da montadora prometeu há alguns anos abalar a indústria automotiva com sua linha de veículos elétricos e uma fábrica futurista. Mas os especialistas da indústria dizem que a insistência de Musk em realizar grande parte do trabalho internamente é uma das razões pelas quais a Tesla não se aproxima de seu objetivo de produzir 500 mil veículos anualmente a partir de 2018, a maioria deles Model 3.

A montadora revelou este mês que montou apenas 260 veículos entre julho e setembro, distante da meta de 1.500 Models 3 para o terceiro trimestre. Em declaração, a Tesla culpou os obstáculos de fabricação, sem dar mais detalhes, mas assegurou aos investidores que "não há problemas fundamentais com a produção de Model 3 ou com a cadeia de fornecimento".

A analista Maryann Keller, que vem acompanhando a indústria automotiva desde a década de 1970, disse que essa não é a competência central de uma montadora. "Por que você gostaria de fazer isso?"

A Tesla recusou pedidos da Reuters para discutir os esforços de produção de assentos. Espera-se que a empresa revele mais sobre seus problemas de produção em 1 de novembro, quando anuncia resultados do terceiro trimestre. Não há indicação de que os "obstáculos" mencionados estejam associados à produção de assentos.

A Tesla ainda não se tornou lucrativa, mas os investidores estão apostando em seu futuro. A empresa é a segunda montadora mais valiosa dos EUA, atrás apenas da General Motors .

* Tesla is industry outlier with Model 3 seats assembled in-house

* Seat suppliers trying to convince Tesla to outsource

* Musk envisions seats assembled by robots

By Alexandria Sage

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Elon Musk was fed up.

The seats on Tesla Inc's new Model X SUV were a mess. An outside contractor was having trouble executing the complicated design, spurring frustration and finger-pointing between Tesla and its supplier.

How would Tesla ever pull off mass production of the upcoming Model 3, the car intended to catapult the niche automaker into the big leagues, if it could not deliver on something as fundamental as a seat?

Musk made a decision: Tesla would build the seats itself.

Tesla's demanding chief executive vowed years ago to shake up the automotive industry with his line of electric vehicles and a futuristic manufacturing facility in Fremont, Calif. But industry experts say Musk's insistence on performing much of the work in-house is among the reasons Tesla is nowhere close to its stated goal of building 500,000 vehicles annually by next year, most of them Model 3s.

The automaker this month revealed it built just 260 of the vehicles between July and September, badly missing its target of 1,500 Model 3s in the third quarter. In a statement, Tesla blamed manufacturing "bottlenecks." It declined to elaborate, but assured investors "there are no fundamental issues with the Model 3 production or supply chain."

Tesla has demonstrated a commitment to vertical integration not seen in the auto industry for decades.

The company has so far sunk $2 billion into a sprawling Nevada factory to manufacture its vehicles' batteries. In-house programmers design the bulk of the complex software that runs the Model 3, which Musk has described as a "computer on wheels". Tesla controls its own retail chain, selling its cars directly to customers and bypassing dealers.

But it is Tesla's 2015 decision to build its own seats that has some industry veterans scratching their heads. Seat making is a low-margin, labor-intensive enterprise that big automakers generally farm out to specialists. Tesla is operating its own seat assembly line inside its factory, and it is hiring engineers and technicians to figure out a way to fully automate the process.

"Is that really the core competency of an auto company? It is not," said analyst Maryann Keller, who has been tracking the car industry since the early 1970s. "Why would you want to do that?"

Tesla declined requests from Reuters to discuss its seat assembly efforts. The company is expected to reveal more about its production issues on Nov. 1, when it announces third-quarter results. There is no indication that the "bottlenecks" mentioned previously by the company are associated with seat production.

Analyst Keller and others suspect Tesla eventually will be forced to farm out seat assembly to suppliers as the company transitions from a niche producer of pricey, hand-built luxury cars to a mass manufacturer. Seat makers including Germany's ZF Friedrichshafen AG [ZFF.UL], France's Faurecia SA and Detroit-based Lear Corp already are trying to win that business. A lot is riding on Tesla's ability to scale up operations quickly. Starting at $35,000, the Model 3 is Tesla's attempt to bring its electric technology to a wider audience. More than a half-million customers have already put down deposits.

Tesla has never turned an annual profit and it is burning through cash. Yet investors are betting big on its future. It is now the second most valuable U.S. automaker, behind only General Motors Co . Tesla shares on Wednesday closed at $325.84, down 3.4 percent.

FROM STOP-GAP TO STRATEGY

Musk has defended Tesla's hands-on approach as the way to ensure reliability, as well as an opportunity to rethink industry norms.

It is also a reflection of the entrepreneur's obsession with detail.

"One of the hardest things to design is a good seat," Musk said at the September 2015 launch of the Model X in Fremont.

Problems first surfaced with the flagship Model S sedan in 2012. Musk complained that the seats made by its contract manufacturer, Australia-based Futuris Group, were not comfortable nor of the quality expected for a car whose price tag started at around $57,400, according to a former Tesla executive who described Musk's thinking to Reuters.

Troubles accelerated with the Model X, leading Tesla to wrest assembly from Futuris just after the vehicle's release in late 2015. If seats could be entirely redesigned from the ground up, Musk reasoned, maybe their assembly could be automated in preparation for the high volumes anticipated for the Model 3.

"He saw the opportunity to do it differently and better," the former Tesla executive said. "The short term was a stop gap, but the long-term idea was to rethink the design of how a seat works to include how a seat is built."

Futuris did not respond to requests for comment. It continues to supply seat parts to Tesla. Detroit-based seating supplier Adient PLC acquired Futuris for $360 million last month. Meanwhile, Tesla's seat woes continue. In all, the automaker has issued four seating-related recalls since 2013. The latest came this month with the recall of 11,000 Model Xs manufactured between Oct. 28, 2016 and Aug. 16, 2017. [nL4N1MN5KU]

SUPPLIERS CIRCLING

Making car seats is a complex business. Choosing materials, dying and cutting, shaping foam and metal frames, and adding heaters, recliners and other gadgets can involve nearly a dozen suppliers for top models. Final assembly requires lots of labor.

That's why most automakers opted decades ago to outsource seats for their lower-cost models to specialty seatmakers whose market is expected to reach $79 billion by 2022, according to market researcher Lucintel.

Although Musk's philosophy has always been "build it right and then figure out how to get the cost down" later, according to the ex-Tesla executive, observers say Tesla can ill afford more production headaches.

Philippe Houchois, an auto analyst with the investment bank Jefferies, wrote in a September note to clients that "scalability" was now the main challenge at Tesla, whose manufacturing prowess is still unproven when it comes to building large numbers of vehicles.

"We don't think Tesla's vertically integrated business model can be scaled up as profitably and quickly as consensus thinks," Houchois wrote.

Despite Tesla's previous battles with Futuris, seat suppliers smell opportunity. ZF Friedrichshafen and Faurecia have opened Silicon Valley labs, in part to woo Tesla.

Lear, which cuts and sews material for Tesla, is likewise pressing to get the automaker's seat manufacturing business, according to Matthew Simoncini, the company's chief executive.

"In general Tesla has a philosophy: 'We'll do it ourselves. We'll change the mold,'" Simoncini said. "(Outsourcing)is a much more efficient use of capital. That would allow them to focus on what they do best."

LEAD 1-STMicro relève sa prévision 2017, la Bourse applaudit - Reuters (French)

{{20171026T091205.759+0000}}LEAD 1-STMicro relève sa prévision 2017, la Bourse applaudit* STMicroelectronics dépasse ses objectifs au T3

* Le T3 dopé par les commandes d'Apple pour ses iPhones

* Relève sa prévision de chiffre d'affaires pour 2017

* Le titre inscrit un plus haut depuis 2004

(Actualisé avec cours et réactions)

PARIS/LONDRES, 26 octobre (Reuters) - Le fabricant de semi-conducteurs STMicrolectronics a relevé jeudi sa prévision de chiffre d'affaires pour 2017 après avoir dépassé ses propres objectifs au troisième trimestre dopé par les commandes de son client Apple , ce qui fait flamber son titre en Bourse.

Le groupe franco-italien a confirmé son redressement après plusieurs années de contre-performances et de restructuration en signant un chiffre d'affaires de 2,14 milliards de dollars, en hausse de 11,1% par rapport au trimestre précédent et de 18,9% sur un an, alors qu'il visait une progression de 9,0%. Le deuxième fabricant européen de semi-conducteurs, qui vient de réintégrer l'indice CAC 40 <.FCHI> des valeurs vedettes parisiennes, a par ailleurs amélioré de 120 points de base sa marge brute par rapport aux trois mois précédents à 39,5%, contre 39,0% attendu au point médian.

Sur un an, le résultat net part du groupe a plus que triplé atteignant 236 millions de dollars contre 71 millions au troisième trimestre 2016.

A 11h11, l'action de STMicroelectronics flambe de 5,25% à 18,65 euros, touchant son niveau le plus haut depuis avril 2004 et signant l'une des plus fortes hausses de l'indice européen Stoxx 600 <.STOXX>.

Cette hausse porte à près de 73% sa progression depuis le début de l'année.

"La prévision pour le quatrième trimestre est encore plus forte, probablement liée à la poursuite de la montée en puissance sur l'iPhone", estiment les analystes de Morgan Stanley dans une note.

Au troisième trimestre, la division "Imaging" a signé une croissance à trois chiffres de ses ventes par rapport au trimestre précédent à la faveur de "la montée en production du nouveau programme de ST pour des applications mobiles", explique STMicroelectronics dans son communiqué de résultats, sans donner de précisions sur le commanditaire du programme.

Selon plusieurs analystes spécialisés, ce nouveau contrat, qui inclut la production de capteurs "time of flight", a été passé avec le géant américain Apple , l'un des principaux clients du fabricant, pour ses iPhones.

OPTIMISTE POUR LE T4

Le programme, qui a été l'un des principaux contributeurs à la croissance du groupe au troisième trimestre, devrait encore monter en puissance au quatrième trimestre, a déclaré aux analystes le directeur financier Carlo Ferro.

Le groupe, dont les puces sont utilisées dans des domaines aussi variés que les téléphones portables, l'automobile ou les objets connectés, a revu à la hausse ses ambitions pour l'ensemble de l'exercice, anticipant une solide croissance à deux chiffres des revenus pour la première fois depuis 2010.

"Pour l'ensemble de l'année, (...), nous prévoyons désormais une croissance du chiffre d'affaires net en 2017 d'environ 18,0% en variation annuelle, accompagnée d'une amélioration sensible de la profitabilité opérationnelle et du résultat net", précise Carlo Bozotti dans le communiqué.

Lors d'une réunion investisseurs en mai dernier, le fabricant avait dit viser pour cette année une hausse de 14% des ventes. [nL8N1ID5MP]

Pour le quatrième trimestre, STMicroelectronics vise une croissance séquentielle du chiffre d'affaires d'environ 10,0%, à plus ou moins 3,5 points de pourcentage et une marge brute à environ 39,9% à plus ou moins 2,0 points de pourcentage près.

"Nous nous attendons à ce que les estimations pour 2018 et au-delà soient revues à la hausse à la faveur de ces résultats et à ce que le titre poursuive son redressement sur fond de forte croissance et d'amélioration de la rentabilité", estiment dans une note les analystes de Liberum qui sont à l'achat sur la valeur.

UPDATE 4-GM's earnings beat, forecast lift shares; supply glut shrinks - Reuters News

{{20171024T155203.007+0000}}UPDATE 4-GM's earnings beat, forecast lift shares; supply glut shrinks(Recasts lead, rewrites throughout to add context, details)

By Nick Carey and Joseph White

DETROIT, Oct 24 (Reuters) - General Motors Co posted stronger-than-expected pre-tax profit for the third quarter on Tuesday, helped by cost-cutting and a shift to higher-margin trucks and sport utility vehicles, and its shares jumped to a record high.

GM reported a net loss due to charges related to the sale of its European operations, but the automaker's operating results beat Wall Street expectations and the company reaffirmed a forecast that 2017 financial results would be in line with last year's record performance.

The automaker also assured investors it was on track to cut stocks of unsold vehicles in the U.S. to a manageable 70-days' supply by the end of the year.

GM, rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , and heavy machinery maker Caterpillar Inc all are benefiting from a strong U.S. economy, continued growth in China and a recovery in demand from Latin America.

In the case of the automakers, U.S. car and light truck sales have so far defied predictions of a significant slump. September sales hit the fastest pace in 12 years as residents of Texas and Florida rushed to replace cars damaged by storms. [nL2N1ME0OD] [nL8N1MZ44E]

The latest results sent GM shares up 2.3 percent to the highest levels since its initial public offering in 2010, amid a broad rally by U.S. manufacturing stocks. [nL2N1MZ0QZ]

GM over the past several months has regained its status as the largest U.S. automaker by market capitalization over electric luxury car maker Tesla Inc .

Some of GM's share price surge has come from investors betting on its investments in self-driving and electric cars. The company's profits, however, are driven entirely by demand for its petrol-fueled trucks and SUVs in North America, and its growing sales in China.

The No. 1 U.S. automaker said it expects U.S. vehicle sales to remain stable at an annual pace of about 17 million light vehicles in 2017, "and we expect that in 2018 as well," GM Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens told reporters on Tuesday.

The U.S. auto industry has been coming off a strong run of sales that culminated in a record 17.55 million units in 2016. Industry analysts have predicted a slight decline for U.S. new car sales in 2017, driven in part by a flood of nearly-new, low-mileage off-lease vehicles into the market.

GM's share price has risen nearly 30 percent this year, in part as the company has highlighted efforts to put self-driving cars on the road. However, spending on autonomous vehicles and ride services amounted to just $150 million in the latest quarter, the company indicated in its financial report.

GM posted lower revenue for the quarter as it shuttered plants in North America to reduce production and tackle bloated inventory levels, especially of unpopular sedan models as consumers move increasingly to pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers.

GM had 76 days' supply of unsold vehicles at the end of September, down from 88 days a month earlier and over 100 in the summer. The company's wholesale volumes were down 26 percent versus the same quarter in 2016.

GM is taming its inventory problem in the United States in part by laying off about 3,100 temporary and full-time hourly workers, mainly at factories that build compact and midsize sedans. The rapid shift by U.S. consumers to SUVs and pickup trucks in response to low, stable gasoline prices has left GM with too many North American factories tooled to produce low-profit sedans, analysts said. [nL4N1MN4NU]

GM showed a pre-tax profit in North America despite the steep production cuts and heavy discounts. Stevens credited cost-cutting and a shift to higher-profit trucks and sport utility vehicles. The company cut North American production costs by $2 billion during the first nine months of 2017.

GM posted a quarterly net loss on Tuesday due to charges stemming from the sale of its Opel unit in Europe to France's Peugeot SA .

Detroit-based GM posted a third-quarter net loss of $2.98 billion, or $2.03 per share, compared with a profit of $2.77 billion, or $1.71 per share a year earlier. Excluding discontinued operations, GM posted a net profit of 8 cents per share.

But excluding one-time charges, the company earned $1.32 a share, above analyst expectations of $1.14.

Revenue in the quarter fell to $33.6 billion from $38.9 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $32.72 billion.

UPDATE 1-Bitcoin is 'Enron in the making', Saudi Prince Alwaleed says - Reuters News

{{20171023T151116.083+0000}}UPDATE 1-Bitcoin is 'Enron in the making', Saudi Prince Alwaleed says(Adds quotes and details on other companies, Aramco)

RIYADH, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Billionaire Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, who owns investment firm Kingdom Holding <4280.SE>, expressed skepticism about cryptocurrencies in an interview with CNBC on Monday, warning that bitcoin was like "Enron in the making".

Prince Alwaleed, whose company invests in major U.S. companies such as Citigroup and Twitter , said a lack of regulation made such cryptocurrencies risky.

"I just don't believe in this bitcoin thing. I think it's going to implode one day. It's Enron in the making," he said, referring to the U.S. energy company that filed for bankruptcy in 2001 after revelations of a widespread accounting fraud.

"This thing does not make sense. It's unregulated. It's not under the control of the U.S. Federal Reserve or any other central bank," he added.

Bitcoin is a virtual currency that has gained more than 500 percent this year, more than any other tradable asset class.

Prince Alwaleed also said the valuation of electric car maker Tesla Inc was "too exuberant" for him to invest.

"I would rather not comment on that because maybe some people think the valuation is right, but it's not for me to enter [at] that price obviously. It's too exuberant for me right now."

He added that U.S. ride services company Lyft had been better priced than rival Uber [UBER.UL] when his investment firm bought into it. [nD5N16M00X]

He said he was "very happy" with his investment in Citigroup and saw potential for the share price to rise above $100. It has been trading at around $73.

SAFETY VALVE

Prince Alwaleed also said he was not considering merging AccorHotels and Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, in which Kingdom Holding owns stakes. [nD5N1HP01N]

On the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, which its CEO reiterated would take place next year, Prince Alwaleed said the transaction would act as a "safety valve" for Saudi Arabia. [nL8N1MY29X]

"If you go 5 percent, there's nothing that prohibits you from going another 5 percent next year, and 5 percent the third year and fourth year, and so forth, depending on the situation."

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said last year the country was considering listing about 5 percent of Aramco in a deal that could raise $100 billion, if the company is valued at about $2 trillion as hoped.

CEO Nasser on Monday brushed off reports about China emerging as a frontrunner in a possible plan to delay the IPO and sell shares to sovereign funds.

"I'm not a member of the government but I read these reports, and I will not be surprised if China will be looking at this opportunity," Prince Alwaleed said.

"China depends on oil and will depend on oil for a long time to come. And Saudi Arabia is an anchor exporter of oil to China."

By Sruthi Shankar

Oct 23 (Reuters) - Wall Street was set to open slightly higher on Monday as investors cheered the continuation of Abenomics following the Japanese ruling party's emphatic win in the weekend polls.

Third-quarter earnings season is also in focus, with 37 percent of S&P 500 companies set to report during the week. Corporate earnings have got off to a strong start, with nearly three quarter of the 88 S&P companies beating profit expectations.

"Investors are being cheered on by the global markets after the Japanese election," said Peter Cardillo, Chief Market Economist at First Standard Financial in New York.

"The strength continues based on the prospect of fiscal reform and good earnings."

Wall Street closed at record highs on Friday after the Senate passed a budget resolution, lifting hopes that President Donald Trump's tax plans may move forward.

The top Senate Republican and the White House budget director said on Sunday they hoped for action on the new tax package by the end of the year, while keeping their options open on how to pay for sweeping tax cuts. [nL2N1MX0JY]

Investors are also keen to know who will take over from Janet Yellen as the next Federal Reserve chief after her term expires in February.

Trump said he would make his choice to lead the Fed soon and was still considering at least three people: Fed Governor Jerome Powell, Stanford University economist John Taylor and Yellen.

At 8:33 a.m. ET (1233 GMT), Dow e-minis <1YMc1> were up 21 points, or 0.09 percent, with 24,470 contracts changing hands.

S&P 500 e-minis were up 1.75 points, or 0.07 percent, with 147,737 contracts traded.

Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 10 points, or 0.16 percent, on volume of 26,232 contracts.

Hasbro dipped 4.6 percent in premarket trading after the toymaker's forecast for the holiday season fell below estimates as Toys'R'Us bankruptcy began to hurt its operations. [nL4N1MY3T8] Shares of Mattel fell 2 percent.

T-Mobile gained 1.39 percent after the No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier's profit topped estimates on subscription growth. [nL2N1MY0DV]

Telecom software company Broadsoft jumped about 17 percent after Cisco agreed to buy it in a deal valued at about $1.9 billion including debt. [nL4N1MY3SR] Cisco shares were up 0.5 percent.

Tesla rose 1.4 percent after the electric car maker said it was in talks with the Shanghai municipal government to set up a factory in the region and expects to agree on a plan by the end of the year. [nL2N1MX0BM]

Saudi's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal says Tesla valuation "too exuberant" - CNBC - Reuters News

{{20171023T121636.767+0000}}Saudi's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal says Tesla valuation "too exuberant" - CNBCDUBAI, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said on Monday the valuation of electric car maker Tesla Inc was "too exuberant" for him to invest in the company.

"I would rather not comment on that because maybe some people think the valuation is right but it's not for me to enter [at] that price obviously. It's too exuberant for me right now," he said in an interview with CNBC.

He also said that U.S. ride services company Lyft was better priced than rival Uber [UBER.UL] when his investment firm Kingdom Holding <4280.SE> bought into Lyft.

"We thought Lyft was a better entry point for us because at that time Uber's price was at the high side," he said, adding that Uber was "still a great company."

BREAKINGVIEWS-Tesla could hit second gear with Shanghai factory - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20171023T020718.326+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Tesla could hit second gear with Shanghai factory(The authors are Reuters Breakingviews columnists. The opinions expressed are their own.)

By Antony Currie and Christopher Beddor

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Oct 23 (Reuters Breakingviews) - A factory in Shanghai could help Tesla shift into second gear. It would give Elon Musk's $58 billion electric-car company a better shot at catching up to or keeping pace with rivals in the fast-growing market. Any deal, though, is apt to have some roadblocks.

China presents a large but perplexing opportunity for all foreign automakers. The country is now the biggest market for passenger cars. Though growth has been slowing, sales increased 3.3 percent in September from a year ago. Worsening air quality, however, has prompted Beijing to consider a possible ban on gasoline-only cars.

Many customers for now prefer gas-guzzling SUVs. And there are plenty of domestic competitors developing battery technology, such as Anhui Zotye Automobile <000980.SZ>, which recently struck an alliance with Ford . Tesla, for all its U.S. hype, has just around a 3 percent share of China's electric-vehicle market. It faces competition from Volvo , which is scrapping petrol-only vehicles from 2019, Daimler and General Motors .

There are nagging problems at home, too. Tesla produced just 260 of its new Model 3s in the third quarter, far short of the more than 1,500 that were targeted. Musk talked of "production hell" on the road to building half a million vehicles next year, or roughly five times as many as the company is likely to manage in 2017. A factory in China should in theory alleviate some of the strain, while reducing costs and customer wait times.

The manufacturing facility deal reported by the Wall Street Journal on Sunday would not alleviate a core problem, however. Cars produced in a factory wholly owned and located within Shanghai's free trade zone probably will be subject to the country's 25 percent import tax.

The only way to evade the levy would be a joint venture with a Chinese partner. Tesla, an unprofitable enterprise currently valued at 30 times expected EBITDA for the next year, so far has been reluctant to tie such a knot because of legitimate concerns about technology transfer. And yet it's hard to imagine how its mass-market models can be competitive in China with the tariff included. As useful as a local factory would be, it may give Tesla limited acceleration.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Tesla has reached an agreement with Shanghai officials to set up a manufacturing facility in the city's free trade zone, according a Wall Street Journal report published on Oct. 22, citing unnamed sources.

- The electric-car company said in June that it would "clearly define" its production plans in China by the end of the year. According to the news report, Tesla would likely still face 25 percent import duties on its factory-produced cars sold in China.

UPDATE 1- Tesla reaffirms effort to build cars in China; mum on deal report - Reuters News

{{20171022T154810.149+0000}}UPDATE 1- Tesla reaffirms effort to build cars in China; mum on deal report(Recasts with Tesla reaffirming talks; adds reference to an earlier statement)

By Joseph White and Norihiko Shirouzu

Oct 22 (Reuters) - Electric car maker Tesla Inc reaffirmed on Sunday it is talking with the Shanghai municipal government to set up a factory in the region and expects to agree on a plan by the end of the year, but declined to comment on a report that a deal has been reached.

China levies a 25 percent duty on sales of imported vehicles and has not allowed foreign automakers to establish wholly owned factories in the country, the world's largest auto market. Those are problems for Tesla, which wants to expand its presence in China's growing electric vehicle market without compromising its independence or intellectual property.

China's government has considered allowing foreign automakers to set up wholly owned factories in free trade zones in part to encourage more production of electric and hybrid vehicles - which the government calls "new energy vehicles" - to meet ambitious sales quotas.

Tesla would still have to pay a 25 percent duty on cars built in a free trade zone, but it could lower its production costs.

Tesla on Sunday pointed to a statement it made in June that the company "is working with the Shanghai Municipal Government to explore the possibility of establishing a manufacturing facility in the region to serve the Chinese market. As we've said before, we expect to more clearly define our plans for production in China by the end of the year."

A Tesla spokesperson in the United States declined to comment further beyond referring to the June statement.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Tesla and the Shanghai government have reached a deal in that city's free trade zone. Shanghai is China's de facto automotive capital and a significant market for luxury vehicles of all kinds.

It was unclear if the Chinese government will conclude a deal with Tesla to coincide with U.S. President Donald Trump's visit next month. [nL2N1MV1ZH]

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has said the company eventually will need vehicle and battery manufacturing centers in Europe and Asia.

Tesla is wrestling with production problems at its sole factory, in Fremont, California. It is trying to accelerate output of its new Model 3 sedan, but conceded earlier this month that production bottlenecks had held third-quarter production to just 260 vehicles, well short of the 1,500 previously planned.

UPDATE 1-Tesla raises borrowing capacity for car leases to $1.1 bln - Reuters News

{{20171020T233023.396+0000}}UPDATE 1-Tesla raises borrowing capacity for car leases to $1.1 bln(Gives details on how company will use borrowing)

Oct 20 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Friday it has increased its borrowing capacity for a car lease program to $1.1 billion from $600 million.

The move comes as the electric car maker spends heavily to fix production bottlenecks of its new Model 3 sedan.

The company increased the borrowing capacity under certain warehouse agreements, the company said in a filing. (http://bit.ly/2yx2P58) A spokesman said it was related to Tesla's car lease program.

In August, Tesla said it would raise about $1.5 billion through its first-ever offering of junk bonds as it seeks fresh sources of cash to ramp up production of its new Model 3 sedan. [nL1N1KT12M]

{{20171020T213649.284+0000}}Tesla raises borrowing capacity under warehouse agreements to $1.1 blnOct 20 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Friday it has increased its borrowing capacity, related to an agreement, to $1.1 billion as the electric car maker spends heavily to fix production bottlenecks of its new Model 3 sedan.

The company has increased the borrowing capacity to $1.1 billion from $600 million, under certain warehouse agreements, the company said in a filing. (http://bit.ly/2yx2P58)

Consumer Reports says Tesla misunderstands 'positive' Model 3 rating - Reuters News

{{20171020T191858.275+0000}}Consumer Reports says Tesla misunderstands 'positive' Model 3 ratingBy Nick Carey

DETROIT, Oct 20 (Reuters) - Consumer Reports said on Friday that Tesla Inc had apparently misunderstood the "average" reliability rating the magazine assigned to the electric carmaker's Model 3 sedan this week, calling it generally "positive" for an all-new vehicle.

Tesla criticized the rating on Thursday, saying "it's important to note that Consumer Reports has not yet driven a Model 3, let alone do they know anything substantial about how the Model 3 was designed and engineered." [L2N1MU1K7]

The rating for the Model 3, which is lower priced than earlier Tesla models and aimed at giving the Silicon Valley automaker mass market appeal, was part of magazine's annual survey of new vehicle reliability.

The survey predicts which cars will give owners fewer or more problems than their competitors, based on data collected. Its scorecard is influential among consumers and industry executives.

"Tesla seems to misunderstand or is conflating some of what we fundamentally do," the magazine, sometimes called the buyer's bible for car shoppers, said in a statement.

"Tesla appears unhappy that CR expects the new-to-market Tesla Model 3 to be of average reliability, which is generally a positive projection for any first model year of a car," the magazine said.

Tesla launched production of the Model 3, its newest car, over the summer.

Consumer Reports said its rating was based on 2,000 consumer survey response about Tesla models. It also noted that its survey listed Tesla's Model S sedan as the magazine's top rated car with "above average reliability for the first time ever."

Palo Alto, California-based Tesla said earlier this month that "production bottlenecks" had left it running behind in ramp-up plans for the Model 3, which is still short in supply with long waiting lists for deliveries. [L4N1MD4G4]

"As with all the cars we review ... we will thoroughly test and evaluate the Model 3 with the same care and scrutiny we apply to all the cars we test just as soon as we can get one - we're waiting patiently along with other consumers," Consumer Reports said.

UPDATE 1-U.S. auto reliability dented by new technology; electric cars fare better - report - Reuters News

{{20171019T194806.178+0000}}UPDATE 1-U.S. auto reliability dented by new technology; electric cars fare better - report(Adds Tesla comment. Recasts throughout.)

By Joseph White

DETROIT, Oct 19 (Reuters) - New technology to stream music into dashboards or boost fuel efficiency is making cars less reliable, although electric cars such as the Tesla Model 3 and the Chevrolet Bolt should fare better than many conventional models, Consumer Reports magazine said on Thursday.

The magazine said its survey of 640,000 vehicles showed that all-new vehicles or models with newly updated technology are more likely than older models to have a "wonky engine, a jerky transmission, or high-tech features that fail outright."

Electric cars do away with many of the mechanical systems that prompt consumer complaints about conventional cars, the magazine said. Tesla Inc's Model 3, despite recent production problems, should have "average" reliability because it relies on technology already used on the older Tesla Model S, Jake Fisher, the magazine's head of automotive testing said on Thursday at a meeting of the Detroit Automotive Press Association.

The Bolt is the most reliable car in General Motors Co's Chevrolet brand, he said.

Tesla in a statement on Thursday criticized Consumer Reports because it previously declared the Model S "to be the best car ever and then revoked the rating after being questioned by Tesla skeptics." As for the Model 3, Tesla said "it's important to note that Consumer Reports has not yet driven a Model 3, let alone do they know anything substantial about how the Model 3 was designed and engineered."

The magazine's annual survey of new vehicle reliability predicts which cars will give owners fewer or more problems than their competitors, based on data collected. Its scorecard is influential among consumers and industry executives.

For the fifth straight year, Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> placed first in the magazine's ranking with the most reliable vehicles on average. General Motors Co's Cadillac brand was last among 27 brands ranked. Tesla ranked 21st on the list.

With many new cars, customers complain about problems with continuously variable transmissions and eight- and nine-speed gear boxes designed to boost fuel mileage, Fisher said.

Hard to use infotainment systems also continue to annoy customers, Fisher said. But over-the-air updates are helping automakers alleviate problems more quickly, he said.

Tesla's Model 3 gets an 'average' as new tech dents auto reliability - Consumer Reports - Reuters News

{{20171019T164500.870+0000}}Tesla's Model 3 gets an 'average' as new tech dents auto reliability - Consumer ReportsBy Joseph White

DETROIT, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc's new Model 3 sedan is likely to have "average" reliability despite production snags because it uses older technology rather than newer innovations that are causing problems for automakers, Consumer Reports magazine said on Thursday.

The magazine said its survey of 640,000 vehicles showed that all-new vehicles or models with newly updated technology are more likely than older models to have a wonky engine, a jerky transmission, or high-tech features that fail outright.

The magazine's annual survey of new vehicle reliability predicts which cars will give owners fewer or more problems than their competitors, based on data collected. Its scorecard is influential among consumers and industry executives.

For the fifth straight year, Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> placed first in the magazine's ranking with the most reliable vehicles on average. General Motors Co's Cadillac brand was last among 27 brands ranked. Tesla ranked 21st on the list.

The magazine's prediction that the Tesla Model 3, which has faced production bottlenecks, will have average reliability illustrates the challenges automakers face.

The Model 3 is the luxury electric vehicle maker's newest car, and Consumer Reports said it had no data on the vehicle. But it relies largely on technology the carmaker has used on its Model S sedan, which has been in production since 2012, and Consumer Reports said predicted reliability for that car is now "above average."

"Electric vehicles are inherently less complicated than gasoline or hybrid alternatives. The Model 3 is the least complicated Tesla yet," Consumer Reports said.

With many new cars, customers complain about problems with continuously variable transmissions and eight- and nine-speed gear boxes designed to boost fuel mileage, the magazine said.

Hard to use infotainment systems also continue to annoy customers. Consumer Reports said its survey found that owners of models in the first year of production reported twice as many complaints about vehicle electronics.

"More often than not, our data suggests it's prudent for consumers to wait for the technology to mature," Jake Fisher, head of Consumer Reports auto testing, said in a statement ahead of a presentation in Detroit.

Automakers are moving quickly to fix problems, the magazine said. After Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> got hit with complaints about the transmission on its 2016 Hyundai Tucson sport utility vehicle, the company took action that reduced complaints about the 2017 model by more than half, Consumer Reports said.

In July, Consumer Reports restored a top rating in its class for Tesla's Model S after the company updated the braking system. [nL3N1KG4MF]

Chinese-funded EV startup buys tech firm headed by former Tesla executive - Reuters News

{{20171019T140001.011+0000}}Chinese-funded EV startup buys tech firm headed by former Tesla executiveBEIJING, Oct 19 (Reuters) - SF Motors Inc, a California-based electric vehicle (EV) unit of China's Chongqing Sokon Industry Group Co Ltd <601127.SS>, on Thursday said it has bought an EV and battery tech firm headed by former Tesla Inc executive Martin Eberhard for $33 million.

The acquired company, InEVit Inc, will become a wholly owned subsidiary of SF Motors, one of an array of Chinese-funded EV startups in China and the United States.

InEVit will continue to operate as a standalone technology firm licensing EV and battery know-how to global automakers. Eberhard, who has worked with SF Motors as an advisor, will become SF Motors' chief innovation officer and vice chairman of the board.

"In this new role, Eberhard will primarily focus on technology innovation, product development, product positioning and branding – all with the goal of helping SF Motors meet global EV demands," SF Motors said in a statement.

"InEVit's expertise, patented technologies and manufacturing techniques will be leveraged to help SF Motors to rapidly and profitably scale e-powertrain production for its own future products, and will look to license this technology to other automakers to help speed zero emission vehicle proliferation across the industry."

SF Motors is the latest Chinese-funded firm to join a boom in EV development.

Established by Sokon Industry, a small automaker in Chongqing producing low-cost micro commercial vans, SF Motors recently established a U.S. research and development (R&D) centre in Silicon Valley and an R&D branch in Ann Arbor, Michigan, as well as branches in Germany, Japan and China.

Sokon Industry also produces and sells crossover sport-utility vehicles (SUVs).

Vestas to build first large-scale battery storage project for wind, solar - Reuters News

{{20171019T104135.443+0000}}Vestas to build first large-scale battery storage project for wind, solarBy Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen

COPENHAGEN, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Denmark's Vestas will help to build the world's first utility-scale project that uses battery technology to store power from both wind and solar sources, it said on Thursday.

The project in Australia aims to bring down the cost of renewable energy production and help secure a steady supply of renewable power to the grid regardless of weather conditions.

It will use batteries supplied by U.S. electric carmaker Tesla Inc and is expected to generate enough power to supply more than 35,000 average Australian homes.

"Hybrid solutions combining wind, solar and storage hold a huge potential for Australia," said Clive Turton, head of Vestas in the Asia Pacific.

The Danish wind turbine maker said it had teamed up with project developer Windlab and Quanta Services .

Vestas will deliver the technology for the 60.2 megawatt (MW) Kennedy Energy Park phase I that will be built in Flinders Shire in central north Queensland.

With years of rapid growth in demand in the wind industry fading, Vestas is positioning itself as a provider of broader renewable energy.

The cost of renewable energy has dropped significantly in recent years with solar leading the way, while Tesla is leading the way in battery storage.

Vestas has said it expects wind power to be profitable even without government subsidies in the next decade. [nL8N1JJ4N8] Goldman Sachs analysts predict renewable energy in Europe will be cheaper than fossil fuels by 2023.

The Australian project will consist of 43.2 MW of wind power capacity using twelve of Vestas' V136-3.6 MW turbines, 15 MW of solar and 2 MW of battery storage.

Vestas Chief Executive Anders Runevad told Reuters in June he aimed to bring such hybrid projects, which are currently small and few in number, up to utility-scale. [nL8N1JJ4N8]

The Kennedy project is owned by a joint venture between Windlab and Eurus Energy Holdings Corp. of Japan.

Northvolt selects north Sweden site for mammoth battery plant - Reuters News

{{20171019T100534.713+0000}}Northvolt selects north Sweden site for mammoth battery plantSTOCKHOLM, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Sweden's Northvolt said on Thursday it had selected a site in the far north of the country for the planned construction of Europe's biggest battery factory as the company continues to seek the billions of euros needed to finance the scheme.

Northvolt and others are racing to set up large-scale battery cell plants in Europe, where automotive and industrial firms have so far relied mainly on Asian imports even as demand for electric begins to pick up.

The decision on a site for the battery plant was the latest step toward realising Northvolt's ambitious plans though it still has billions of euros in financing to secure.

South Korea's LG Chem <051910.KS> said last week it will open Europe's largest lithium-ion battery factory in Poland next year, employing 2,500 workers to produce up to 100,000 electric vehicle batteries per year. [nL8N1MN20I]

Northvolt Chief Executive Peter Carlsson said while the plant would be located in Skelleftea and would eventually employ 2,000-2,500 people, the main research and development operations would be set up in Vasteras, due west of Stockholm.

"If environmental processes and other permitting moves as planned, we will be able to put the shovel in the earth during the later part of 2018 to build the first eight gigawatt hours," Carlsson told a news conference.

The location in the far north would leave the plant near Sweden's main cluster of mines and mineral resources in a region that is home to a large body of workers in industries such as metal-working and has ample energy capacity.

Northvolt said rail connections already serving other industries in the northern region, as well as Skelleftea's deep-sea port, meant it did not expect transport costs to be prohibitive due the plant's location.

Carlsson said Northvolt was in talks with several companies about sourcing of key battery ingredients such as nickel, cobalt and lithium but declined to set a deadline for when deals needed to be in place.

Former Tesla executive Carlsson's Northvolt wants the Swedish plant to rival the scale of the U.S. electric carmaker's Gigafactory in the Nevada desert, targeting annual cell production equivalent to 32 gigawatt-hours by 2023, which would make it far larger than LG Chem's Polish plant.

Northvolt needs at least 4 billion euros ($4.7 billion) in investments to realise its battery factory plans and is currently seeking to raise between 80 million and 100 million euros to fund a pre-production line.

"We are involved in a number of (financing) processes that we will be able to show the results of going forward," Carlsson said. "So it is not something that keeps me up at night."

($1 = 0.8501 euros)

Tesla augmente les salaires de 30% dans sa filiale allemande - Reuters (French)

{{20171018T171816.380+0000}}Tesla augmente les salaires de 30% dans sa filiale allemandeHAMBOURG, 18 octobre (Reuters) - Tesla et les représentants syndicaux de sa filiale allemande Grohmann sont parvenus à un accord sur une nouvelle grille salariale qui va entraîner une augmentation d'environ 30% des revenus des employés de ce spécialiste de la robotisation industrielle, a annoncé le conseil d'entreprise.

"Nous allons désormais parvenir à un niveau compétitif de salaires", a dit mercredi un porte-parole du conseil d'entreprise à l'issue d'une réunion du personnel sur le site de Tesla Grohmann Automation à Prüm, dans l'ouest de l'Allemagne.

Dans un communiqué transmis par courriel, Tesla a déclaré que cette nouvelle grille salariale, entrée en vigueur rétroactivement le 1er octobre, garantirait au personnel "un salaire juste et compétitif" et prévoyait aussi une hausse de la rémunération des apprentis. Le constructeur américain de voitures électriques n'a pas confirmé le chiffre de 30%.

Environ 650 personnes travaillent chez Grohmann et Tesla leur a garanti en avril un emploi jusqu'à au moins 2022. Ces ingénieurs et techniciens ont aussi chacun reçu 10.000 euros en actions Tesla et une prime de 1.000 euros avec leur paie d'avril, ainsi qu'une augmentation mensuelle de 150 euros, selon le groupe d'Elon Musk.

Tesla a racheté Grohmann en 2016 avec l'espoir que l'expertise de cette entreprise allemande en matière d'automatisation lui permettrait d'atteindre son objectif de produire 500.000 véhicules d'ici 2018.

FIRMEN UND BRANCHEN - WEITERE NACHRICHTEN UND TERMINE:

* AIR BERLIN und mehrere Bundesländer basteln mit Hochdruck an einer Auffanglösung
für tausende Mitarbeiter der insolventen Fluglinie. Für eine Transfergesellschaft werde wohl ein
mittlerer zweistelliger Millionen-Euro-Betrag benötigt, sagte ein Konzernsprecher. Hier sei Eile
geboten. Entscheidend sei, wie viele Beschäftigte in die Einrichtung zur Vermittlung und
Qualifizierung wechseln würden.

* AIR BERLIN: Der Pilot des letzten Air-Berlin-Flugs aus den USA ist nach dem umstrittenen
Flugmanöver vom Dienst suspendiert. "Wir nehmen den Vorfall sehr ernst", sagte ein
Konzernsprecher. Denn Sicherheit habe in der Luftfahrt oberste Priorität.

* THOMAS COOK: Der Reisekonzern will mit einer neuen Fluggesellschaft auf der
Ferieninsel Mallorca sein Angebot ausbauen. Die Thomas Cook Airlines Balearics werde mit
mindestens drei Flugzeugen ab dem Frühjahr 2018 an den Start gehen, teilte das Unternehmen mit.

* TESLA: Der US-Elektroautobauer sichert sich die Leistung seiner Belegschaft beim
deutschen Ableger GROHMANN AUTOMATION mit einer besseren Gehaltsstruktur und einer Jobgarantie.
Das Unternehmen habe sich mit dem Betriebsrat auf eine eigene Entgeltstruktur verständigt, sagte
ein Sprecher der Arbeitnehmervertretung. "Wir kommen jetzt auf ein konkurrenzfähiges
Lohnniveau." Die Gehaltsstruktur der Mitarbeiter liege künftig etwa 30 Prozent über der
bisherigen.

* VARTA reizt beim Börsengang die Preisspanne voll aus. Der Produzent von
Mikrobatterien für Hörgeräte oder Kopfhörer dürfte den Ausgabepreis für seine Aktien auf 17,50
Euro festlegen, sagte eine mit der Angelegenheit vertraute Person Reuters. Die Preisspanne lag
zwischen 15 und 17,50 Euro. Der Ausgabepreis soll am Mittwochabend mitgeteilt werden, am
Donnerstag sollen die Aktien erstmals an der Frankfurter Börse gehandelt werden.

* FORD will in Nordamerika aus Sicherheitsgründen rund 1,3 Millionen Autos in die
Werkstätten zurückbeordern. Bei den betroffenen Fahrzeugen, darunter der F-150 und
Super-Duty-Pickups, gebe es ein Problem mit den seitlichen Türverriegelungen, teilte der
US-Autobauer mit.

* RITTER: Quadratische Schokoladen-Tafeln bleiben vorerst ausschließlich dem
Süßwaren-Hersteller Ritter ("Ritter Sport") vorbehalten. Das Unternehmen aus Waldenbuch bei
Stuttgart erzielte im Kampf um das Alleinstellungsmerkmal vor dem Bundesgerichtshof (BGH) einen
Etappensieg gegen den Rivalen Milka. Die Karlsruher Richter entschieden, dass sich die
charakteristische Form der "Ritter Sport" durchaus als Marke schützen lasse.

* TOTAL stellt sich auf eine neue Investitionsoffensive der US-Schieferölindustrie
ein. Die weltweite Ölnachfrage werde in diesem Jahr deutlich zulegen, sagte Total-Chef Pouyanne
auf einer Branchenkonferenz in London. Die Schieferölproduzenten in den USA gehen seinen Worten
zufolge nicht von einem erneuten Preisrutsch aus. Daher werde es dort wieder eine
Investitionswelle geben.

* BANKEN: Die zum Jahreswechsel in Kraft tretenden neuen europäischen Regeln für
Wertpapiergeschäfte (MiFID II) bringen für die deutschen Banken enorme Kosten mit sich. "Wir
erwarten bis zu einer Milliarde Euro für die Umstellung, dazu kommen noch laufende Kosten.
Dieses Geld könnten die Banken an anderer Stelle gut gebrauchen", sagte der Hauptgeschäftsführer
des Bankenverbandes BdB, Kemmer.

BLICKPUNKT POLITIK:

* USA/TRUMP: US-Präsident Trump lehnt offenbar doch eine überparteiliche Zwischenlösung bei
der Gesundheitsreform ab. Trump erklärte auf Twitter, er unterstütze zwar den federführenden
Senator Alexander als Person "und auch den Vorgang". Allerdings könne er sich niemals hinter
Hilfen für Unternehmen stellen, die durch die Gesundheitsreform ein Vermögen verdient hätten. Am
Dienstag hatte Trump noch Zustimmung zu dem Plan des Republikaners Alexander und der Demokratin
Murray signalisiert. Die Übergangslösung soll die Gesundheitsreform von Trumps Vorgänger Obama
für zwei Jahre stabilisieren, um Zeit für eine gründliche Überarbeitung des Gesundheitssystems
zu gewinnen.

* DEUTSCHLAND/EU-GIPFEL: Die Bundesregierung hat die Warnung von FDP-Chef Lindner
zurückgewiesen, wonach sie in EU-Fragen zurzeit nicht entscheidungsfähig ist. Zum EU-Gipfel in
dieser Woche reise eine "normale Bundeskanzlerin" an, sagte ein Regierungsvertreter am Mittwoch.
Nach der Konstituierung des Bundestages in der kommenden Woche werde das Kabinett zu einer
geschäftsführenden Regierung - allerdings mit denselben Befugnissen wie zuvor. Dann entspreche
es aber den Geflogenheiten, eine "gewisse Zurückhaltung" zu üben, hieß es mit Blick auf die
Gespräche zur Bildung einer Jamaika-Koalition aus CDU, CSU, FDP und Grünen.

* FDP-Bundesvize Kubicki soll vorerst einer der stellvertretenden Bundestagspräsidenten
werden. FDP-Chef Lindner bestätigte bei Twitter einen "Bild"-Bericht, wonach er den 65-Jährigen
am Freitag in der Fraktionssitzung für dieses Amt vorschlagen werde. Medienberichten zufolge
soll aber über die Personalie neu nachgedacht werden, falls die FDP an der Regierung beteiligt
sein wird.

Tesla to raise pay by 30 pct at German division - works council - Reuters News

{{20171018T150742.938+0000}}Tesla to raise pay by 30 pct at German division - works councilHAMBURG, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Luxury electric car maker Tesla Inc and labour leaders at its German engineering unit have agreed a new pay structure that will raise workers' salaries by about 30 percent from current levels, the division's works council said.

"We will now get to a competitive wage level," a spokesman for the works council said on Wednesday after a staff gathering at Tesla Grohmann Automation GmbH, based in western Germany.

"The workforce was informed today that we will introduce a pay structure" at Grohmann, which has about 650 workers, he said, without elaborating.

In an emailed statement, Tesla said the new remuneration structure, retroactively effective from Oct. 1, guarantees staff "a fair and competitive salary" and will include a pay raise for apprenticeships, but it did not confirm the 30 percent figure.

In April, Tesla pledged a 5-year job guarantee for all Grohmann employees up to at least 2022. Workers also received a 10,000-euro ($11,800) grant each of Tesla stock and an additional bonus of 1,000 euros with their April pay and a monthly salary increase of 150 euros, it said.

Tesla faces higher wage costs in Germany as it wrestles with what Chief Executive Elon Musk has described as "production hell" in launching its new Model 3 sedan, which Tesla hopes will make it a mass-market producer. [nL4N1MH3QR]

The company warned earlier this month that production bottlenecks had left the company behind with its planned ramp-up for the Model 3.

German daily newspaper Die Welt reported the wage pact earlier on Wednesday.

Before being bought by Tesla last year, Grohmann, based in the town of Pruem near the Luxembourg border, helped clients build highly automated and efficient factories, including battery assembly lines for electric cars.

The U.S. carmaker is counting on Grohmann's automation and engineering expertise to help it ramp up production to 500,000 cars per year by 2018 through the design of ultra-efficient factories. ($1 = 0.8490 euros)

Tesla einigt sich mit deutscher Belegschaft auf Gehaltssteigerung - Reuters (German)

{{20171018T142802.267+0000}}Tesla einigt sich mit deutscher Belegschaft auf GehaltssteigerungHamburg, 18. Okt (Reuters) - Der US-Elektroautobauer Tesla sichert sich die Leistung seiner Belegschaft beim deutschen Ableger Grohmann Automation mit einer besseren Gehaltsstruktur und einer Jobgarantie. Das Unternehmen habe sich mit dem Betriebsrat auf eine eigene Entgeltstruktur verständigt, sagte ein Sprecher der Arbeitnehmervertretung am Mittwoch. "Wir kommen jetzt auf ein konkurrenzfähiges Lohnniveau." Die Gehaltsstruktur der Mitarbeiter liege künftig etwa 30 Prozent über der bisherigen. Zudem seien die 650 Arbeitsplätze bis 2022 gesichert. Als erste hatte die Tageszeitung "Die Welt" darüber berichtet.

Über die neue Entgeltstruktur war monatelang gerungen worden. Im Frühjahr hatte die IG Metall mit einem Arbeitskampf gedroht, um Tesla zur Übernahme des in der Metall- und Elektroindustrie geltenden Tarifvertrags zu bewegen. Daraufhin hatte das Unternehmen bereits jedem Mitarbeiter eine Einmalzahlung von mehren Tausend Euro in bar oder in Tesla-Aktien zugesagt.

Tesla baut den vor einem Jahr übernommenen Anlagenbauer mit Sitz in Prüm in der Eifel zu einem Zentrum für automatisierte Fertigung aus. Die Firma entwickelt und vertreibt Anlagen, die Tesla für den Wandel zu einem Massenhersteller dringend benötigt. Der Konzern aus dem Silicon Valley kommt mit der Steigerung der Produktion seines für den Aufstieg zum Massenhersteller wichtigen Model 3 nicht wie geplant voran. Statt der versprochenen mehr als 1500 Elektrofahrzeuge liefen im dritten Quartal nur 260 Stück vom Band. Zuletzt verschob Tesla die Präsentation seines Elektro-Lkw (Tesla Semi).[nL8N1MH5DV]

UPDATE 1-Volvo unveils Polestar model in China, looks to rival Tesla 3 - Reuters News

{{20171017T151346.145+0000}}UPDATE 1-Volvo unveils Polestar model in China, looks to rival Tesla 3(Adds comments from CEO, details)

By Adam Jourdan

SHANGHAI, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Volvo Cars and its Chinese parent have unveiled their first Polestar high performance electric car and pledged to invest 5 billion yuan ($760 million) in the brand, gearing up for intense competition to sell greener cars in the world's biggest auto market.

The Swedish car maker took the wraps off the "Polestar 1", a luxury four-seater hybrid coupe in a ceremony in Shanghai - its first salvo as it positions the brand as a competitor to Tesla Inc and Mercedes's AMG division.

China has said it wants electric and plug-in hybrid cars to make up at least a fifth of Chinese auto sales by 2025, spurring a raft of investment plans from global automakers in electric vehicles, particularly new joint ventures with Chinese firms.

The Polestar 1 - with a nominal pricetag of 130,000 euros to 150,000 euros ($153,000-$176,000) - will go into production in the western Chinese city of Chengdu in mid-2019. Close behind will be the smaller, fully electric Polestar 2, that would compete more directly with the Tesla 3, and an SUV Polestar 3.

Volvo, owned by Zhejiang Geely Holding [GEELY.UL], bought Polestar in 2015 and relaunched the brand as a stand-alone electric car business in June this year. [nL8N1JI0NV]

Volvo's chief executive Hakan Samuelsson said there was huge demand for premium electric cars in China, but added a lot of others players were moving into the market, raising competition.

"In electric high-performance cars there are a lot of companies now in this start-up arena, so we will have company," he said in Shanghai.

The Polestar 1 will be produced in "lower volume", but the subsequent models will be "mass produced" and all will be sold online via a subscription model involving monthly payments.

China has set strict quotas for electric and hybrid vehicles that carmakers need to hit by 2019 and has begun looking at an eventual ban on the production and sale of cars using fossil fuels.

Samuelsson said China's aggressive push towards electric vehicles was positive, though he disagreed with the prescriptive nature of the quota system. He added the government would need to work cooperatively with carmakers to make the shift work.

"You cannot do this alone. We cannot build up (for example) the charging infrastructure in China; developing the tech, the politicians can't do either," he said.

Volvo has said that all its car models launched after 2019 will be electric or hybrids, making it the first major traditional carmaker to set a date for phasing out vehicles powered solely by the internal combustion engine. [nL8N1JW0JU] ($1 = 6.6013 Chinese yuan) ($1 = 0.8519 euros)

FACTBOX-Kobe Steel's data fabrication leaves "Made-in-Japan" champions scrambling - Reuters News

{{20171017T110231.939+0000}}FACTBOX-Kobe Steel's data fabrication leaves "Made-in-Japan" champions scrambling(Updates with details of more companies)

TOKYO, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Revelations from Japan's third-biggest steelmaker Kobe Steel Ltd <5406.T> that it had fabricated data for some of its aluminium and copper and other products have left affected manufacturers scrambling to pin down the potential impact.

The company supplies materials and components to companies around the world and said its product data falsification affected around 500 companies, including some global household names.

No safety problems have surfaced as Kobe Steel attempts to confirm the extent of the data tampering. The government has ordered the company to address safety concerns within about two weeks and report on how the misconduct occurred in a month.

The following lists companies that have received falsely certified parts or are checking whether they have received them.

Listed also are companies included in media reports, where Reuters has not been able to confirm the status.

BOEING

Boeing Co , the world's biggest maker of passenger jets, has used Kobe Steel 5406.T products that include those falsely certified by the Japanese company, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

AIRBUS

Airbus SE does not buy products directly from Japan's Kobe Steel but is investigating whether any of its suppliers are affected by the cheating scandal, an Airbus spokesman said.

The Nikkei newspaper had reported earlier that the aircraft maker had received Kobe Steel products with falsified specifications.

FORD

Ford Motor Co said its Ford Mondeo in China has an aluminium hood from Kobe Steel but that it had not confirmed whether this was an affected product.

GENERAL MOTORS

General Motors Co said it is was investigating whether any autos contained products sourced from Kobe Steel.

TOYOTA

Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Japan's largest automaker, said the compliance breach was a "grave issue", adding that Kobe Steel's products were used in vehicle doors and hoods.

ROLLS ROYCE

Rolls-Royce Holdings said it received affected products but they have not been used.

KOREAN AIR

Korean Air Lines Co <003490.KS> said it has supplied parts using Kobe Steel products to Boeing and was investigating.

HYUNDAI MOTOR

Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> and sister car maker Kia Motors Corp <000270.KS> said panels produced by Kobe Steel have been used in the IONIQ and Niro models.

NISSAN

Doors and hoods were affected at Nissan Motor Co <7201.T>, a spokesman said.

The automaker is grappling with its own compliance failures, recalling all new cars sold in Japan in the last three years after discovering final vehicle inspections were not performed by authorised technicians. [nL4N1MH0TP]

HONDA, SUBARU

Honda Motor Co <7267.T> also said doors and hoods were affected, while Subaru Corp <7270.T> said vehicles and aircraft were affected.

Japanese industry ministry officials said Kobe Steel materials were used in some defence equipment made by Subaru.

SUZUKI

Suzuki Motor Corp <7269.T> says affected products supplied by Kobe Steel were used in its motorcycles.

Other automakers affected by Kobe Steel's announcement are Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T> and Mitsubishi Motors Corp <7211.T>, the companies confirmed.

MITSUBISHI HEAVY

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd <7011.T> said Kobe Steel products were used on its Mitsubishi Regional Jet and rockets, including the H-2A rocket launched on Oct. 10 to put a navigation satellite into orbit. The rocket cleared all safety checks before launch, the company said.

Japanese industry ministry officials said Kobe Steel materials were used in some defence equipment made by Mitsubishi Heavy.

IHI

Heavy machinery maker IHI Corp <7013.T> said affected products were used in its jet engines.

IHI is a supplier for engines used on Boeing Co aircraft and in Japan's defence and aerospace industries. The company did not say which engines used the affected products.

Japanese industry ministry officials said Kobe Steel materials were used in some defence equipment made by IHI.

HITACHI

Hitachi Ltd <6501.T> said affected aluminium products were used in its trains in Japan and the U.K.

The company said it plans to exchange parts used in the undercarriage of bullet trains running on JR Tokai and JR West lines.

It was not possible to switch out components used in train bodies, such as on JR East bullet trains and in its U.K trains, the company said, adding it is considering whether to seek compensation from the steelmaker.

JR TOKAI

Central Japan Railway Company Co <9022.T>, which operates the bullet train line between Tokyo and Osaka, said affected products were used in train undercarriages and would be replaced.

JR WEST

West Japan Railway Co <9021.T> said affected parts were used and that it will seek compensation from the steelmaker.

JR EAST

East Japan Railway Co <9020.T> said affected parts were used in bullet train bodies.

KAWASAKI HEAVY

Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd <7012.T> said affected materials were used in aircraft parts and in engine components while it was still investigating to see if there were any other products including trains that used affected materials.

Japanese industry ministry officials said Kobe Steel materials were used in some defence equipment made by Kawasaki Heavy.

MITSUBISHI ELECTRIC

Mitsubishi Electric Corp <6503.T> said affected copper was used in air conditioners produced domestically.

TEPCO

Fukushima nuclear operator Tokyo Electric Power Holdings Inc (Tepco) <9501.T> said on Oct. 13 it had taken delivery of pipes from Kobe Steel that were not checked properly. The pipes were delivered to its Fukushima Daini station, located near the destroyed Fukushima Daiichi plant, but have not been used, Tepco said. Tepco was checking all its facilities.

VOLKSWAGEN

Volkswagen AG [VOWG_p.DE] said Kobe Steel is not a direct supplier and that it was checking the situation with its own suppliers.

PANASONIC

Panasonic Corp <6752.T> said affected products were used in Blu-ray discs and had also received affected copper and copper alloy pipes from Kobe Steel.

DAIMLER

Daimler AG said on Oct. 13 that Kobe Steel is not a supplier after the Nikkei business daily reported the same day that it had received products from the steelmaker with falsified specifications.

PSA GROUP

PSA Group also said on Oct. 13 that Kobe Steel is not a supplier after the Nikkei reported it had also received products from the steelmaker with falsified specifications.

The Nikkei also said the following companies have been supplied with Kobe Steel products with faked specifications.

A Kobe Steel spokesman told Reuters the companies had all received parts and components originating from the steelmaker but did not confirm whether they had been tampered with.

The companies are listed below by sector, separated between Japanese and non-Japanese companies.

VW - Fokussieren uns künftig sehr stark auf Tesla - Reuters (German)

{{20171014T184926.922+0000}}VW - Fokussieren uns künftig sehr stark auf TeslaBerlin, 14. Okt (Reuters) - Volkswagen sieht im Elektroauto-Hersteller Tesla einen zunehmend wichtigen Rivalen. "Tesla wird sich mit seinem innovativen Geschäftsmodell nicht nur auf das Premiumsegment beschränken, sondern seine Fähigkeiten auch auf das Volumensegment auszurollen versuchen", sagte VW-Markenchef Herbert Diess der "Automobilwoche" laut Vorab-Bericht vom Samstag. "Daher fokussieren wir uns im zukünftigen Wettbewerb sehr stark auf Tesla und weniger auf Toyota oder Hyundai." Strategiechef Michael Jost sagte, VW werde Tesla in den USA früher als geplant mit einem geeigneten Modell begegnen. Der Automobilwoche zufolge soll dieses Auto zwischen Teslas Model 3 und Model S angesiedelt sein sowie 2021 auf den Markt kommen. Es soll von Leistung, Reichweite und Kosten her auf den US-Markt zugeschnitten sein.

Jost sagte zudem, VW sei mit seinem Elektrobaukasten der Konkurrenz weit voraus. "Darauf werden wir mehrere Millionen Fahrzeuge für die großen Märkte USA, Europa und China bauen." VW wolle aber auch wieder mit konventionellen Geländewagen punkten und plant dem Branchenblatt zufolge neben Tiguan und Atlas ein neues Einstiegs-SUV für die USA: "Wir haben die USA noch längst nicht aufgegeben. Von zentraler Bedeutung wird unsere SUV-Strategie sein", sagte Jost. Das Blatt berichtete, interne Planungen gingen von jährlich weltweit bis zu 500.000 verkauften Einheiten des neue Einstiegs-SUVs aus. Zudem werde das Preisgefüge für mehr Konkurrenzfähigkeit geändert. "Wir waren in den USA preislich bisher immer über dem Wettbewerb positioniert", sagte Jost.

Unternehmenskreise - Tesla feuerte Hunderte Mitarbeiter in einer Woche - Reuters (German)

{{20171014T031651.931+0000}}Unternehmenskreise - Tesla feuerte Hunderte Mitarbeiter in einer WocheBangalore, 14. Okt (Reuters) - Der US-Elektroautobauer Tesla hat einem Insider zufolge in dieser Woche etwa 400 Mitarbeiter entlassen. Betroffen seien etwa Führungskräfte, Team-Chefs und Vorarbeiter, sagte am Freitag ein früherer Beschäftigter, der namentlich nicht genannt werden wollte. Tesla bestätigte Entlassungen, nannte aber keine Zahl. Als Grund für die Kündigungen gab Tesla mangelnde Leistungen an.

Das in Palo Alto in Kalifornien ansässige Unternehmen hatte zu Monatsbeginn erklärt, es kämpfe derzeit mit Produktionsengpässen bei seinem neuen Model 3, das für den Massenmarkt gedacht ist.

UPDATE 1-Tesla fired hundreds of employees in past week  - Reuters News

{{20171014T020543.896+0000}}UPDATE 1-Tesla fired hundreds of employees in past week (Changes sourcing to former employee)

Oct 13 (Reuters) - Luxury electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc fired about 400 employees this week, including associates, team leaders and supervisors, a former employee told Reuters on Friday.

The dismissals were a result of a company-wide annual review, Tesla said in an emailed statement, without confirming the number of employees leaving the company.

"It's about 400 people ranging from associates to team leaders to supervisors. We don't know how high up it went," said the former employee, who worked on the assembly line and did not want to be identified.

Though Tesla cited performance as the reason for the firings, the source told Reuters he was fired in spite of never having been given a bad review.

The Palo Alto, California-based company said earlier in the month that "production bottlenecks" had left Tesla behind its planned ramp-up for the new Model 3 mass-market sedan. [nL4N1MD4G4]

The company delivered 220 Model 3 sedans and produced 260 during the third quarter. In July, it began production of the Model 3, which starts at $35,000 - half the starting price of the Model S.

missed revenue estimates for a fourth straight quarter.

22,894.59. The S&P 500 <.SPX> was up 0.18 percent at 2,555.62 and the Nasdaq
Composite <.IXIC> was up 0.26 percent at 6,608.923.

USA-Les valeurs à suivre à Wall Street (actualisé) - Reuters (French)

{{20171013T125113.709+0000}}USA-Les valeurs à suivre à Wall Street (actualisé)(Actualisé avec Wells Fargo, HP, contrats à terme)

13 octobre (Reuters) - Principales valeurs à suivre vendredi à Wall Street où les contrats à terme sur indices laissent présager une ouverture en hausse modérée :

* BANK OF AMERICA , la deuxième banque américaine par les actifs, a publié vendredi un bénéfice trimestriel en hausse de 15%, grâce à un strict contrôle de ses coûts et à la hausse des taux d'intérêt. [nL8N1MO2SG] D'abord orienté à la baisse, le titre s'est retourné à la hausse pour gagner 1,2% dans les échanges avant l'ouverture.

* WELLS FARGO recule de 2,2% dans les échanges avant-Bourse après la publication par la troisième banque américaine par les actifs d'un bénéfice en repli de 18,6% au troisième trimestre, pénalisé par des frais juridiques et une baisse des revenus du crédit immobilier. [nL8N1MO3E5]

* MONSANTO , en passe d'être racheté par Bayer , avance de 1,7% en avant-Bourse en réaction à la vente d'une partie des activités de semences et d'herbicides du groupe chimique allemand à son concurrent BASF pour 5,9 milliards d'euros en numéraire. La cession porte sur une bonne partie des actifs que Bayer doit vendre pour mener à bien l'acquisition de Monsanto. [nL8N1MO0VH]

* TESLA - Le constructeur de voitures électriques a annoncé jeudi soir le rappel de 11.000 SUV Model X dans le monde en raison d'une défaillance du mécanisme d'attache des sièges arrières qui risque de les faire tomber vers l'avant en cas d'accident. Seuls 3% des véhicules rappelés pourraient présenter ce défaut qui a été détecté lors de tests, a précisé le groupe. L'action était peu changée à 356,50 dollars dans les échanges d'avant-Bourse.

* FORD recule de 0,3% après avoir publié jeudi la plus faible croissance de ses ventes en Chine sur un mois depuis son entrée sur ce marché. Barclays a abaissé son conseil à "pondération en ligne" contre "surpondérer".

* GENERAL MOTORS gagne 0,9% en avant-Bourse dans le sillage d'un relèvement de recommandation de Barclays, à "surpondérer" contre "pondération en ligne", avec un objectif de cours porté à 55 dollars contre 41 dollars.

* HP INC , société regroupant les activités de matériel informatique de l'ex-Hewlett Packard, a dit prévoir pour l'année 2018 un bénéfice par action compris entre 1,74 et 1,84 dollar, alors que le consensus Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S tablait sur un BPA de 1,77 dollar. Le titre gagne 1,7% en avant-Bourse.

* WESTERN DIGITAL - Toshiba <6502.T> discute d'un investissement en commun dans une nouvelle ligne de production de semi-conducteurs au Japon avec Western Digital, son partenaire américain qui a engagé une procédure contre le groupe japonais pour bloquer la vente de ses mémoires à l'un de ses concurrents. [nL8N1MO1BE]

* EQUIFAX - Le fournisseur de données financières a démenti jeudi soir avoir subi une nouvelle intrusion informatique, comme l'avait rapporté un site d'information, ce qui avait fait reculer le titre en Bourse. [nL8N1MN6AI]

* DOLLAR TREE - Loop Capital Markets a dégradé sa recommandation sur le distributeur discount, à "conserver" contre "acheter", en pointant le niveau élevé de sa valorisation.

FACTBOX-Kobe Steel's data fabrication leaves "Made-in-Japan" champions scrambling - Reuters News

{{20171013T095033.146+0000}}FACTBOX-Kobe Steel's data fabrication leaves "Made-in-Japan" champions scrambling(Updates with more companies)

TOKYO, Oct 13 (Reuters) - The revelation that Japan's third-biggest steelmaker Kobe Steel Ltd <5406.T> fabricated data for some of its aluminium and copper and other products has left affected manufacturers scrambling to pin down the potential impact. [nL4N1MO1A1]

The products were shipped to around 500 companies which include some of the world's most recognisable names.

The following lists companies that have received falsely certified parts or are checking whether they have received them. Listed also are companies included in media reports, where Reuters has not been able to confirm the status.

BOEING

Boeing Co , the world's biggest maker of passenger jets, has used Kobe Steel 5406.T products that include those falsely certified by the Japanese company, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

AIRBUS

Airbus does not buy products directly from Japan's Kobe Steel but is investigating whether any of its suppliers are affected by the cheating scandal, an Airbus spokesman said. The Nikkei newspaper had reported earlier that the aircraft maker had received Kobe Steel products with falsified specifications.

TOYOTA

Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Japan's largest automaker, said the compliance breach was a "grave issue", adding that Kobe Steel's products were used in vehicle doors and hoods.

NISSAN

Doors and hoods were also affected at Nissan Motor Co <7201.T>, a spokesman said.

The automaker is grappling with its own compliance failures, recalling all new cars sold in Japan in the last three years after discovering final vehicle inspections were not performed by authorised technicians. [nL4N1MH0TP]

HONDA, SUBARU

Honda Motor Co <7267.T> said doors and hoods were affected, while Subaru Corp <7270.T> said vehicles and aircraft were affected.

Japanese industry ministry officials said Kobe Steel materials were used in some defence equipment made by Subaru.

Other automakers affected by Kobe Steel's announcement are Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T> and Mitsubishi Motors Corp <7211.T>, the companies confirmed.

MITSUBISHI HEAVY

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries <7011.T> said Kobe Steel products were used on its Mitsubishi Regional Jet and rockets, including the H-2A rocket launched on Oct. 10 to put a navigation satellite into orbit. The rocket cleared all safety checks before launch, the company said.

Japanese industry ministry officials said Kobe Steel materials were used in some defence equipment made by Mitsubishi Heavy.

IHI

Heavy machinery maker IHI Corp <7013.T> said affected products were used in its jet engines.

IHI is a supplier for engines used on Boeing Co aircraft and in Japan's defence and aerospace industries. The company did not say which engines used the affected products.

Japanese industry ministry officials said Kobe Steel materials were used in some defence equipment made by IHI.

KAWASAKI HEAVY

Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd <7012.T> said affected materials were used in airplane parts and airplane engine parts while it was still investigating to see if there were any other products including trains that used affected materials.

Japanese industry ministry officials said Kobe Steel materials were used in some defence equipment made by Kawasaki Heavy.

JR TOKAI

Central Japan Railway Company (JR Tokai) <9022.T>, which operates the bullet train line between Tokyo and Osaka, said falsely certified products from Kobe Steel were used in some train undercarriages. The products do not pose a safety risk and will be replaced.

JR WEST

West Japan Railway <9021.T> said it has affected parts from Kobe Steel that were falsely certified and will seek compensation from the steelmaker.

TEPCO

Fukushima nuclear operator Tokyo Electric Power <9501.T> (Tepco) said on Oct. 13 it had taken delivery of pipes from Kobe Steel that were not checked properly. The pipes were delivered to its Fukushima Daini station, located near the destroyed Fukushima Daiichi plant, but have not been used, Tepco said. Tepco was checking all its facilities.

DAIMLER

Daimler AG said on Oct. 13 that Kobe Steel is not a supplier after the Nikkei business daily reported the same day that it had received products from the steelmaker with falsified specifications.

PSA GROUP

PSA Group also said on Oct. 13 that Kobe Steel is not a supplier after the Nikkei reported it had also received products from the steelmaker with falsified specifications.

The Nikkei also said the following companies have been supplied with Kobe Steel products with faked specifications.

A Kobe Steel spokesman told Reuters the companies had all received parts and components originating from the steelmaker but did not confirm whether they had been tampered with.

The companies are listed below by sector, separated between Japanese and non-Japanese companies.

Denso Corp <6902.T>, Suzuki Motor <7269.T>, Yamaha Motor <7272.T>, Sumitomo Wiring Systems, Takata Corp, Fujitsu <6702.T>, Yazaki Corp.

Tesla , General Motors , Renault , Hyundai Motor <005380.KS>, Daimler , Valeo and Volvo .

{{20171013T095003.317+0000}}BUZZ-'GM set to recoup lost market cap from Tesla' - Barclays** Barclays raises rating on General Motors to "overweight" from "equal-weight"

** GM deserves a valuation multiple expansion, with company making progress on electrification and autonomy, just as Tesla faces production issues, Barclays says

** Sees potential for both auto and non-auto investors, to view GM's progress and Tesla's production challenges as a sign that some of Tesla's market cap needs to go back to GM

** Barclays analyst Brian Johnson: GM more of an "evolving mammal than the dying dinosaur its valuation implies"

** Last week, GM outlined plans to add 20 new battery electric and fuel cell vehicles to its global lineup by 2023; "General Motors believes in an all-electric future," GM global product development chief Mark Reuss had said [nL2N1MD1YS]

** Brokerage says does not see a spinoff of GM business as likely in near term

** Raises PT to $55 from $41, an upside of 22.5 pct to stock's Thursday close

Guten Morgen von Reuters am Freitag, den 13. Oktober - Reuters (German)

{{20171013T050649.065+0000}}Guten Morgen von Reuters am Freitag, den 13. OktoberTOP NEWS:

* USA/IRAN: US-Präsident Trump will seine neue Iran-Strategie am Nachmittag um 18.45 MESZ
vorstellen, wie das Präsidialamt mitteilte. Dann dürfte er auch bekanntgeben, ob er an dem
Atomabkommen mit der Islamischen Republik festhalten will. Trump hat das unter seinem Vorgänger
Obama geschlossene Abkommen wiederholt als "einen der schlechtesten Deals" aller Zeiten
kritisiert.

* ACS/ABERTIS: Der spanische HOCHTIEF-Eigner ACS wird nach Informationen von
Insidern in der kommenden Woche eine Offerte zur Übernahme des spanischen Mautstraßen-Betreibers
Abertis abgeben. Das Gebot bestehe etwa je zur Hälfte aus neuen Hochtief-Aktien und Bargeld,
sagten mit der Angelegenheit vertraute Personen der Nachrichtenagentur Reuters. Der größte
deutsche Baukonzern Hochtief würde damit in Konkurrenz zum italienischen Infrastrukturkonzern
ATLANTIA treten, der bereits mit einem rund 17 Milliarden Euro schweren Übernahmeangebot
um Abertis buhlt.

BLICKPUNKT ZENTRALBANKEN UND KONJUNKTUR:

* EZB: Innerhalb der EUROPÄISCHEN ZENTRALBANK (EZB) gibt es Insidern zufolge eine breite
Mehrheit für eine Drosselung der expansiven Konjunkturhilfen. Beim nächsten EZB-Treffen am 26.
Oktober würden die Ratsmitglieder wohl dafür stimmen, das Anleihen-Kaufprogramm (QE) zwar zu
verlängern, aber mit einem geringerem Umfang, sagten fünf mit der Angelegenheit vertraute
Personen Reuters.

* EZB-Direktor Coeure hat die Notenbanken vor negativen Folgen bei einem zu langen
Festhalten an den massiven Wertpapierkäufen gewarnt. Dann bestehe die Gefahr von Finanzblasen,
sagte er am Rande der Jahrestagung des IWF. "Wir müssen auf Risiken für die Finanzstabilität
achten." Coeure fügte hinzu: "Beispielsweise könnte eine zu lange Phase der Wertpapierkäufe
finanzielle Ungleichgewichte aufbauen mit möglichen negativen Folgen für die Preisstabilität."

* USA/FED: US-Präsident Trump treibt die Suche nach einem Kandidaten für den Chefposten der
Zentralbank Federal Reserve voran. Wie das Präsidialamt mitteilte, traf er sich dazu mit dem
Ökonom Taylor von der Standford-Universität. An dem Gespräch hätten unter anderem auch
Vizepräsident Pence und Finanzminister Mnuchin teilgenommen. Eine unmittelbare Entscheidung
steht demnach aber nicht bevor.

* EZB-Präsident Draghi hat die Zeitfolge für eine Veränderung der wichtigsten
geldpolitischen Instrumente der Notenbank betont. "Das 'weit über die Zeit' ist sehr, sehr
wichtig, um Zinserwartungen zu verankern", sagte Draghi. Die EZB hatte erst auf ihrer
September-Zinssitzung bekräftigt, dass ihre Schlüsselzinsen weit über die Zeit des laufenden
Anleihenkaufprogramms hinaus auf dem aktuell Niveau liegen werden.

* IWF und WELTBANK: Fortsetzung der Jahrestagung (bis 15. Okt.)

=========================================

BLICKPUNKT POLITIK:

* WAHLUMFRAGE/NIEDERSACHSEN: Wenige Tage vor der Landtagswahl in Niedersachsen liegt die SPD
einer Umfrage zufolge knapp vor der CDU. Im ZDF-Politbarometer kommt die CDU auf 33 Prozent
(unverändert im Vergleich zur Vorwoche) und die SPD auf 34,5 Prozent (plus 1,5). Die Grünen
würden neun Prozent (unverändert) erreichen und ebenso neun Prozent die FDP (minus ein
Prozentpunkt). Die Linke kommt auf fünf Prozent und die AfD auf sieben Prozent (beide
unverändert). Die anderen Parteien liegen zusammen bei 2,5 Prozent (minus 0,5).

* DEUTSCHLAND: Die frühere AfD-Chefin Petry will mit einer neuen "Blauen Partei"
konservative Wähler des rechten Parteispektrums für sich gewinnen. "Wir werden in den kommenden
Monaten das Bürgerforum 'Blaue Wende' vorstellen, in dem man sich mit und ohne Parteibuch
unabhängig von der Farbe engagieren kann", sagte Petry im Interview mit dem RedaktionsNetzwerk
Deutschland.

* DEUTSCHLAND: Die CDU-Vorsitzende Merkel hat vor einer Blockade im Bundesrat gewarnt, falls
es in Niedersachsen ein rot-rot-grünes Bündnis geben sollte. Auf einer
CDU-Wahlkampfveranstaltung in Vechta kritisierte Merkel den niedersächsischen
Ministerpräsidenten Weil (SPD), weil er nach der Niedersachsenwahl am Sonntag kein Bündnis mit
der Linkspartei ausschließen wolle.

* DEUTSCHLAND: Eine Jamaika-Koalition könnte in Deutschland nach Einschätzung von
EU-Kommissar Oettinger auch längere Zeit an der Macht bleiben. "Wenn es Jamaika gelingt, den
Menschen die Angst vor der Zukunft zu nehmen, dann hat dieses Bündnis eine Zukunft über diese
Legislaturperiode hinaus", sagte der CDU-Politiker dem "Focus".

* BREXIT: Die EU-Staats- und Regierungschefs wollen bei ihrem Gipfel in der kommenden Woche
dem Entwurf einer Abschlusserklärung zufolge von Großbritannien Nachbesserungen in den
Brexit-Verhandlungen fordern. Zugleich wollen sie der Regierung in London aber für den nächsten
Gipfel im Dezember einen raschen Start von Gesprächen über die künftigen Handelsbeziehungen in
Aussicht stellen, wenn es den verlangten Fortschritt gibt, wie aus dem Dokument hervorgeht, das
Reuters einsehen konnte.

* NAFTA: Mexiko und Kanada wollen trotz der schwierigen Gespräche mit den USA die
Neuverhandlungen des nordamerikanischen Freihandelsabkommen fortsetzen.

* ITALIENS Abgeordnete haben sich hinter die umstrittene Reform des Wahlrechts gestellt. Mit
375 zu 215 Stimmen billigten sie endgültig die Veränderung des Wahlsystems, die verhindern soll,
dass es unterschiedliche Machtverhältnisse im Senat und Abgeordnetenhaus gibt.

* Ein erster TÜRKISCHER Militärkonvoi hat am späten Donnerstagabend die SYRISCHE
Rebellen-Provinz Idlib erreicht. Die Türkei will einen Sicherheitspuffer an der Grenze zu Syrien
schaffen.

SNAPSHOT MÄRKTE:

* Mit Blick auf die Fahrt aufnehmende Berichtssaison haben sich die Anleger an der WALL
STREET am Donnerstag zurückgehalten. Nach neuen Rekordständen im frühen Handel ließen die
führenden US-Indizes im späten Handel Federn.

* Die US-KREDITMÄRKTE legten zu. Händler erklärten die Aufschläge mit einer starken
Nachfrage nach Staatspapieren bei einer milliardenschweren Bond-Auktion durch das
US-Finanzministerium.

* Die ASIATISCHEN BÖRSEN setzen ihre Rekordjagd fort. Der NIKKEI-Index<.N225> in Japan
kletterte zwischenzeitlich um bis zu 0,3 Prozent auf 21.013 Punkte. Das ist der höchste Stand
seit Dezember 1996. Händler schrieben die Aufschläge vor allem der Wahrscheinlichkeit zu, dass
die Regierungspartei die noch in diesem Monat anstehenden Wahlen für sich entscheidet.

{{20171012T211742.159+0000}}Tesla to recall 11,000 Model X SUVs due to seat issueOct 12 (Reuters) - Electric carmaker Tesla Inc is recalling 11,000 Model X sport utility vehicles worldwide due to a faulty locking mechanism in their rear seats that raises the risk of the seats falling forward in a crash.

Tesla said on Thursday a small number of cables in the second row fold-flat seats in some Model X vehicles, manufactured between October 28, 2016 and August 16, 2017, may need to be adjusted to fix the issue.

The company, which is led by Elon Musk, said about 3 percent of the recalled vehicles may have the issue, which was detected during internal testing.

Tesla said it had not received reports of any issues or accidents related to the problem.

Palo Alto, California-based Tesla had recalled 2,700 Model X SUVs in the United States in April 2016 due to a faulty locking hinge in the third-row seats. (http://reut.rs/2yIuFvG)

The company recalled 90,000 Model S sedans worldwide in 2015 over a possible defect in the front seat belt assembly and a year earlier had recalled 29,222 of the same model over a charging defect that posed a fire hazard.

Tesla's shares were little changed at $355.64 in extended trading on Thursday.

UPDATE 2-LG to open Europe's biggest car battery factory next year - Reuters News

{{20171012T135746.853+0000}}UPDATE 2-LG to open Europe's biggest car battery factory next year* Aims to produce 100,000 car batteries in Poland per year

* Customers to include top car companies

* EU struggles to build its own battery production business

(Adds comments, background)

By Marcin Goettig

WARSAW, Oct 12 (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Chem <051910.KS> will open Europe's largest lithium-ion battery factory in Poland next year as the region's auto industry gears up to mass produce electric cars.

Tumbling battery prices and growing pressure to cut exhaust emissions have led carmakers to embrace electric vehicles. Manufacturers from VW Group to Volvo Cars, Daimler and BMW plan to roll out a raft of new electric models in coming years.

But Europe lacks big-scale battery cell production facilities so those components are mostly imported from China and South Korea.

Calls are now growing for the region to develop its own battery industry to preserve jobs and profits, though Asian producers have a huge head start in development and scale.

LG Chem plans to spend 5.9 billion zlotys ($1.63 billion) on the factory near the southwestern city of Wroclaw, according to Polish state industry agency ARP.

Wroclaw is 190 kilometres (118 miles) from the border with Germany, home of VW Group which plans to invest more than 20 billion euros ($24 billion) in zero-emission vehicles by 2030 and make 3 million electric vehicles (EVs) a year by 2025.

LG Chem expects to produce up to 100,000 EV batteries in Poland annually from next year, it said on Thursday in a statement.

The factory will employ 2,500 people. LG Chem, a subsidiary of Korea's LG Corp <003550.KS>, did not name the likely customers but said they would include top car companies.

"The company has chosen Poland as the most competitive location for production to satisfy the needs of European and global car producers," said Chang-Beom Kang, vice president at LG Chem.

It was not immediately clear if the factory would produce all the basic battery cells from scratch or import some components, but the statement said the site would include a research and development centre employing "about 400 engineers from various specialisations: automation, electronics, chemistry and IT".

Asked about the source of lithium and other raw materials, a representative of LG Chem's local arm said they would first be imported from the parent company in Korea and then hopefully from Polish suppliers.

DEMAND SURGE

The factory's planned capacity is just a fraction of expected future demand.

Based on the typical capacity of a mid-market compact car like Nissan Leaf, 100,000 car batteries are equivalent to 4 GWh per year. This means the factory's capacity could be slightly more than 10 percent of the production capacity that Tesla's U.S. based "Gigafactory" is to reach in 2018.

Battery costs have been prohibitive but are falling rapidly. Average battery costs have come down from over $1,000 per kilowatt hour in 2010, to around $227 in 2016, according to analysts at Barclays.

In 2016, only 0.2 percent of new passenger cars sold in Europe were fully electric.

But Britain and France say they will ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2040 in an attempt to reduce air pollution, ending use of the fossil fuel-guzzling internal combustion engine.

LG's Polish plant may not remain Europe's largest car battery plant for long.

In September, Swiss engineering group ABB said it had joined a project to build Europe's largest lithium-ion battery factory in Sweden targeting annual cell production equivalent to 32 gigawatt-hours by 2023, over 90 percent of Tesla's Gigafactory target.

That project, named Northvolt, is led by a former manager at Tesla, which also plans to build a Gigafactory in Europe, though it has not said where. ($1 = 0.8428 euros) ($1 = 3.6117 zlotys)

Norway seeks to trim lavish electric car subsidies  - Reuters News

{{20171012T115245.778+0000}}Norway seeks to trim lavish electric car subsidies * Price hikes seen for largest cars such as Tesla

* Norway has world's highest rate of electric car ownership

OSLO, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Norway plans to trim lavish tax breaks for Tesla and other electric cars that have given it the world's highest rate of battery-vehicle ownership, the right-wing government proposed on Thursday [nL5N1M23R5].

The draft 2018 budget would mainly affect large cars weighing more than two tonnes, it said. Norwegian media dubbed the changes a "Tesla Tax", intended to cut down on sales of luxury models such as Tesla's Model X sport utility vehicle.

The proposal would change an exemption from motor vehicle registration tax and discounts in taxation of company cars. Norwegian media estimated it could push up the price of a Tesla Model X by 70,000 Norwegian crowns ($8,850).

"Electric cars will still be accorded significant advantages in comparison with cars running on fossil fuels," the proposal said. It keeps in place breaks from value-added tax and benefits for zero carbon pollution.

Twenty-nine percent of all new car registrations in Norway were fully electric or plug-in hybrids last year, according to the International Energy Agency, far ahead of the second-place Netherlands, with 6.4 percent, and Sweden in third, on 3.4.

"Norway is gambling with the electric car market," Petter Haugneland of the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association told Reuters.

Sales of Teslas rose almost 90 percent to 4,717 cars in the first nine months of the year from 2,500 in the same period of 2016, according to official sales statistics. Other carmakers, from Nissan <7201.T> to Volkswagen , have also had rising sales.

Environment Minister Vidar Helgesen has said that large electric cars wear out the roads just as much as normal cars. And electric car subsidies in Norway were originally introduced to encourage small, domestically produced electric cars, rather than luxury imports for the rich.

The minority government will need backing from other parties for its proposal.

UPDATE 1-Evergrande property magnate seizes top spot on China rich list - Reuters News

{{20171012T052647.660+0000}}UPDATE 1-Evergrande property magnate seizes top spot on China rich list(Adds graphic)

By Adam Jourdan

SHANGHAI, Oct 12 (Reuters) - China has a new richest man, according to the annual Hurun rich list of the country's top movers and shakers.

Xu Jiayin, the chairman of developer China Evergrande Group <3333.HK>, has seized top spot - beating out more familiar faces such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd's Jack Ma and rival property magnate Wang Jianlin of Dalian Wanda Group.

Xu's reported $43 billion wealth - a gain of around $30 billion against last year - comes on the back of a surge in Evergrande's shares, up over 450 percent so far this year amid plans to cut debt and focus on profit over scale.

The Hurun Report, established in 1999, is the leading China-based organization ranking the wealth of the country's rich and famous, and its list gives a temperature check on the winners and losers in China.

Growth in China stabilised this year, but while the world's second largest economy averted a hard landing, some major corporations have buckled under the weight of their debt or been sanctioned by authorities over risky investments overseas.

Wanda's Wang - who took top spot for the last two years - dropped to fifth in the list after Wanda sold off much of the firm's hotel and theme park assets to rivals in July, after coming under regulatory scrutiny over its high leverage.

Close behind Evergrande's Xu were China's top tech titans - Alibaba's Jack Ma and Tencent Holdings Ltd's <0700.HK> Pony Ma, who has seen his firm's value rise on the popularity of its WeChat messaging app and its popular online games.

The list also underlined those who have fallen from grace in corporate China.

Jia Yueting, founder of sprawling conglomerate LeEco that once looked to rival both Tesla Inc and Netflix, dropped to 1,978th place from 31st last year.

Yang Kai, chairman of embattled Huishan Dairy <6863.HK> - 66th last year - dropped off the list entirely as his firm fights off creditors amid billions of dollars of unpaid debt.

On the up was Wuxi Pharma Tech's Li Ge and his wife, propelled by China's push towards drug innovation, Zhang Lei of fast-growing online news portal Toutiao and Li Shufu of carmaker Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd <0175.HK>.

"It has been a good year for manufacturing, cars, education, TMT and healthcare," Hurun founder Rupert Hoogewerf said.

While many of those on the 2,000-strong list were members of the National People's Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, only a few were delegates at the upcoming five-yearly Party Congress that begins next week.

These included corn magnate Li Denghai, alcohol billionaire Wu Shaoxun and Pan Gang of dairy giant Yili <600887.SS>.

The list, with a combined wealth of $2.6 trillion, saw average wealth rising 12.5 percent - faster than broader economic growth - pointing to the growing financial muscle of China's super-rich elite.

BMW estuda possível joint venture para veículos elétricos na China, dizem fontes - Reuters (Portuguese, Brazil)

{{20171011T195432.013+0000}}BMW estuda possível joint venture para veículos elétricos na China, dizem fontesXANGAI/PEQUIM, 11 Out (Reuters) - A montadora de luxo alemã BMW está buscando formar uma joint venture com a Great Wall Motor <601633.SS> na China, a qual poderia se concentrar em veículos elétricos, disseram duas fontes familiarizadas com o assunto nesta quarta-feira.

Um empreendimento com a Great Wall, cujas ações cotadas em Hong Kong saltaram 20 por cento com as notícias, seria o segundo da BMW no maior mercado de automóveis do mundo, onde as montadoras estrangeiras precisam fazer parceria com empresas locais para atuar.

"Estamos em discussões com a Grande Muralha sobre a criação de uma joint venture para produzir carros em Changshu", disse um executivo da BMW, falando em condição de anonimato por não estar autorizado a revelar as conversas.

Outra pessoa familiarizada com o assunto disse que a nova joint venture não trabalharia com carros movidos a gasolina ou diesel, indicando um provável foco em veículos elétricos.

As vendas da BMW na China cresceram 11,3 por cento no ano passado. É a segunda maior marca do país depois da Audi, da Volkswagen . A BMW está tentando se manter à frente da terceira posição, mantida pela Mercedes-Benz, unidade da Daimler , que registrou crescimento de 26,6 por cento nas vendas chinesas em 2016, graças a uma nova linha de modelos.

Outras montadoras anunciaram recentemente uma série de investimentos e parcerias na China. Tesla , Ford Motor , Daimler e General Motors estão entre as que já anunciaram planos para desenvolver veículos elétricos na China.

FOKUS 1-EU sucht bei Batterien für E-Autos Anschluss an Asien - Reuters (German)

{{20171011T170456.960+0000}}FOKUS 1-EU sucht bei Batterien für E-Autos Anschluss an AsienBrüssel/München, 11. Okt (Reuters) - Die europäische Automobilindustrie startet mit Hilfe der Politik die Aufholjagd bei der Produktion von Batterien für Elektroautos. Der Markt für diese Energiespeicher dürfte bis Mitte des nächsten Jahrzehntes 250 Milliarden Euro groß werden, sagte EU-Energiekommissar Maros Sefcovic am Mittwoch. Allein deshalb müsse man dabei sein, dazu kämen noch viele neue Jobs. "Ich bin nicht gewillt, den Markt den Wettbewerbern zu überlassen", betonte Sefcovic. Bislang dominieren bei Batteriezellen für E-Autos asiatische Hersteller wie Panasonic<6752.T>, LG<003550.KS> oder Samsung<005930.KS>. In Europa sei man spät dran, sagte Wirtschaftsstaatssekretär Matthias Machnig. Bis nächstes Jahr müsse es eine Strategie dazu geben.

Beim "Batteriegipfel" in Brüssel, zu dem sich 40 Firmenvertreter aus der Auto-, Chemie- und Technologiebranche unter der Schirmherrschaft der EU-Kommission trafen, gab es Machnig zufolge einen "sehr breiten Konsens", ein Ökosystem für die Akkuproduktion in Europa zu starten. Ziel sei, die gesamte Expertise bei Forschung und Entwicklung zusammenzubringen. Die großen Autobauer wollen in den nächsten Jahren viele neue E-Autos auf die Straße bringen. Sie reagieren damit auch auf den Druck der Politik, die Schadstoffemissionen zu reduzieren.

Wie Reuters am Dienstag aus EU-Kreisen erfahren hatte, will die EU-Kommission den CO2-Ausstoß der Autoflotten bis 2030 um bis zu 35 Prozent drücken. Die Neuwagen-Flotten der Autokonzerne müssten dann zwischen 25 und 35 Prozent und Lieferwagen 30 bis 40 Prozent weniger Kohlendioxid(CO2) produzieren, sagten mit den Plänen vertraute Personen. Die bisherigen EU-Regelungen zum CO2-Ausstoß gelten nur bis 2021. Dann dürfen die Autos im Schnitt maximal noch 95 Gramm CO2 ausstoßen. Dies entspricht einem Verbrauch von etwa vier Litern Benzin auf 100 Kilometern.

Um die Elektromobilität zu fördern, will die EU den Kreisen zufolge 800 Millionen Euro zur Verfügung stellen, um Ladepunkte auszubauen. Ferner sollen 200 Millionen Euro für die Entwicklung der Batterietechnik fließen. Diskutiert wird zudem über eine Quote für Elektroautos. Diesen Weg geht unter anderem China. "Ich persönlich mag keine Quoten", sagte EU-Klimakommissar Miguel Arias Canete. Die "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" berichtete am Mittwoch vorab, die EU-Kommission wolle die Autobauer ab 2030 dazu verpflichten, dass mindestens 15 Prozent aller Neuwagen in Europa mit einem Elektromotor oder anderen emissionsfreien Antrieben ausgestattet sind.

EU sucht bei Batterieproduktion Anschluss an Asien - Reuters (German)

{{20171011T145713.029+0000}}EU sucht bei Batterieproduktion Anschluss an AsienBrüssel, 11. Okt (Reuters) - Die europäischen Automobilkonzerne starten mit Hilfe der Politik die Aufholjagd bei der Produktion von Batterien für Elektro-Autos. Der Markt für die Energiespeicher dürfte bis Mitte des nächsten Jahrzehnte 250 Milliarden Euro schwer werden, sagte EU-Energiekommissar Maros Sefcovic am Mittwoch. Allein deshalb müsse man dabei sein, dazu kämen noch viele neue Jobs. "Ich bin nicht gewillt, den Markt den Wettbewerbern zu überlassen."

Dazu trafen sich unter der Schirmherrschaft der EU-Kommission Firmen aus der Automobil-, Chemie- und Technologiebranche. Insgesamt waren 40 Vertreter bei dem Batteriegipfel dabei gewesen. Nun sollen als nächstes Arbeitsgruppen eingesetzt werden, die sich mit einzelnen wichtigen Themen beschäftigen wie Lieferketten oder Handelsfragen. Das ganze Projekt ist offen für neue Partner aus der Industrie, von Universitäten und von Banken, die die Finanzierung anschieben sollen.

* Room in the market for two paralell cobalt contracts

* Benchmark for cash-settled cobalt has to be IOSCO compliant

By Pratima Desai

LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange's new cobalt contract is likely to be for a chemical compound vital for the manufacture of the batteries used in the fast-growing electric vehicle sector, its chief executive Matt Chamberlain told Reuters on Tuesday.

Demand for that chemical -- cobalt sulphate -- is expected to soar over coming years as governments around the world set targets and timelines for electric vehicle sales in a bid to cut noxious emissions from fossil-fuelled cars.

The exchange is planning to launch a suite of contracts including cash-settled cobalt sulphate, lithium, hot rolled coil steel, alumina and aluminium contracts in one go in 18 months to two years. [nL8N1LP1E5]

The cobalt contract currently traded on the exchange is for physically settled refined metal, often used in superalloys that go into jet engines, launched in 2010.

"There is room in the market for two parallel contracts. One for cobalt metal and the second a chemical, so probably cobalt sulphate," Chamberlain told the Reuters Global Commodities Summit, adding the exchange was talking to battery and electric vehicle makers.

"They've approached us because the industry needs some coordination in terms of how benchmarks are going to emerge. You don't want to embed benchmarks that are not going to be hedgeable or tradeable in the future.

The consultation with the industry will include a round table discussion during LME Week, an annual industry gathering starting on Oct. 30.

"A good proportion of those who have announced electric vehicle projects have expressed a desire to be involved," Chamberlain said.

"They all want to differentiate on how sleek their cars are, but they have a very common set of challenges in terms of sourcing the materials."

One prominent example is Volkswagen , which is planning to invest more than 20 billion euros ($24 billion) in zero-emission vehicles by 2030 and make three million EVs a year by 2025 to challenge pioneer Tesla in creating a mass market. [nL5N1M34OI]

Cobalt, a byproduct of copper and nickel output, boosts energy density and extends the life of rechargeable batteries. This allows automakers to offer guarantees between eight and 10 years.

Cash-settled contracts are typically settled against benchmark prices gathered from the physical market.

"With benchmarks the first step is to understand what is embedded in industry contracts, " Chamberlain said. "For battery chemicals that's lithium, cobalt sulphate and possibly even nickel sulphate."

Any benchmark will have to conform with principles set out by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), which aim to protect investors, reduce systemic risk and ensure markets are fair efficient and transparent.

"We have a pretty robust process, we're working with users and benchmark providers to help find benchmarks which can be traded and which will get through the IOSCO process," Chamberlain said.

"We haven't made a decision yet," he said adding that the decision will be made with battery and electric car makers.

Benchmark Mineral Intelligence already offers price data and analysis for raw materials such as lithium, graphite, cobalt and nickel used in the rechargeable lithium-ion batteries.

Metals consultancy CRU Group is looking at creating a price index for cobalt sulphate.

CRU consultant George Heppel expects global demand for cobalt metal at nearly 136,000 tonnes in 2021 and more than 161,000 tonnes in 2025 from roughly 102,000 tonnes this year.

Demand for batteries used in electric vehicles and mobile appliances is expected to account for 46 percent of that in 2021, up from about 40 percent this year.

Chine-BMW et Great Wall étudient un projet de coentreprise-source - Reuters (French)

{{20171011T072805.338+0000}}Chine-BMW et Great Wall étudient un projet de coentreprise-sourceSHANGHAI/PEKIN, 11 octobre (Reuters) - BMW étudie un projet de coentreprise avec le constructeur chinois Great Wall Motor <2333.HK>, a rapporté mercredi une source proche du dossier.

Les deux groupes envisagent la possibilité d'ouvrir une usine d'assemblage à Changshu, dans l'est de la Chine, a déclaré un responsable du constructeur de voitures de luxe allemand, sans préciser quels types de véhicules pourraient y être fabriqués.

"J'ignore à quel point nous en sommes arrivés dans cette procédure" ou si les deux entreprises ont le feu vert du gouvernement chinois, a-t-il indiqué.

Les constructeurs étrangers ont annoncé une série d'investissements dédiés à la voiture électrique en Chine, dont l'objectif est que les véhicules électriques ou hybrides représentent à l'horizon 2025 20% au moins des ventes.

Pékin envisage également d'assouplir sa réglementation en matière de coentreprise.

Tesla , Ford Motor , Daimler , et General Motors ont déjà annoncé des projets d'investissements dans les voitures électriques en Chine.

Un porte-parole de BMW en Chine n'a pas souhaité s'exprimer sur cette information, tandis qu'un responsable de Great Wall s'est refusé à tout commentaire.

L'action du constructeur chinois cotée à Hong Kong a bondi de 19,2% après cette annonce, à un pic de plus de deux ans, et a terminé sur un gain de 16,6%. Le titre coté à la Bourse de Shanghai a été suspendu dans l'attente d'une annonce.

Le site iautodaily.com avait fait état le premier de ce projet entre BMW et Great Wall.

BMW a déjà formé une coentreprise en Chine avec le constructeur Brilliance China Automotive Holdings <1114.HK>.

Nvidia dévoile une plate-forme pour des véhicules 100% autonomes - Reuters (French)

{{20171010T153236.689+0000}}Nvidia dévoile une plate-forme pour des véhicules 100% autonomespar Eric Auchard

LONDRES, 10 octobre (Reuters) - Nvidia a dévoilé mardi les premières puces informatiques destinées à la conception de véhicules entièrement autonomes et a dit avoir plus de 25 clients travaillant à la construction d'une nouvelle classe de voitures sans conducteur, de "robotaxis" et de poids-lourds.

Deutsche Post DHL Group , numéro un mondial de la messagerie et de la logistique, et l'équipementier automobile ZF [ZFF.UL] envisagent de déployer dès 2019 une flotte de camions de livraison autonomes basés sur les nouvelles puces, a expliqué le fabricant américain de semi-conducteurs.

La troisième génération de puces pour l'automobile Drive PX de Nvidia, connue sous le nom de code Pegasus, est une plate-forme de la taille d'une plaque d'immatriculation équipée de plusieurs puces ayant la puissance de calcul d'un data center (centre de données).

Pegasus peut traiter 320.000 milliards d'opérations par seconde, ce qui représente globalement une performance treize fois supérieure à celle de la génération actuelle baptisée PX 2.

Selon Nvidia, avec un seul processeur de la famille Xavier, les constructeurs automobiles peuvent mettre au point un véhicule semi-autonome de niveau 3, tandis qu'une combinaison de plusieurs processeurs mobiles et graphiques permet de concevoir un véhicule autonome de niveau 5.

Un véhicule de niveau 5 est capable de rouler sans aucune intervention d'un conducteur et, dans sa version épurée, il n'aura ni volant ni pédale de freins.

Dans une voiture de niveau 3, le volant est toujours nécessaire, en cas notamment de problème. Les véhicules de niveau 4 eux sont conçus pour circuler sans conducteur sur des voies dédiées.

A Wall Street, l'action Nvidia a touché mardi un nouveau record à 192,95 dollars et conserve un gain de 1,56% à 188,28 dollars vers 15h25 GMT. Le titre a gagné près de 80% depuis le début de l'année.

"Nvidia dispose d'une longueur d'avance. Mais on peut s'attendre certainement à ce qu'Intel, NXP et Renesas ne soient pas loin derrière", a déclaré Luca De Ambroggi, analyste au cabinet d'études IHS Markit.

Intel , le géant américain des puces pour ordinateurs, et sa filiale dédiée à l'automobile Mobileye travaillent avec le constructeur automobile allemand BMW et l'équipementier américain Delphi sur leur propre plate-forme de conduite autonome prévue pour 2021. [nL8N1L22KG]

Le fabricant de puces pour smartphones Qualcomm a annoncé l'an dernier le rachat pour 38 milliards de dollars (28 milliards d'euros) de NXP Semiconductors , le premier fournisseur mondial d'électronique pour l'automobile, mais leur projet de fusion est toujours en cours d'étude par les autorités de la concurrence. [nL8N1MK2GY]

Le fabricant de puces japonais Renesas <6723.T> dispose pour sa part d'une forte présence dans les microcontrôleurs utilisés pour gérer les fonctions clés des voitures.

Le directeur automobile de Nvidia, Danny Shapiro, a expliqué dans un entretien qu'une majorité des premiers clients ayant adopté la plate-forme Pegasus se concentrerait sur les robotaxis, des véhicules autonomes sans volants ni pédales de freins qui circuleront uniquement sur des routes dédiées.

Les grands constructeurs automobiles annonceront eux-mêmes dans les mois à venir, selon leur calendrier, les véhicules conçus avec la plate-forme Pegasus, a-t-il ajouté à l'occasion d'une conférence de développeurs à Munich.

PIÈCE MANQUANTE

La plate-forme Pegasus sera mise à la disposition des constructeurs automobiles d'ici mi-2018 afin qu'ils commencent à développer leurs véhicules et à tester les différents logiciels.

L'accord entre Deutsche Post, ZF et Nvidia porte également sur les futurs camions de livraison de Deutsche Post baptisés StreetScooter, dont un prototype a été présenté à Munich.

Ces véhicules seront destinés dans un premier temps pour de la logistique sur des routes privées dans les centres de fret ou pour le transport sur longue distance sur des voies dédiées, a déclaré Danny Shapiro.

"Ils ne remplacent pas les conducteurs, mais rendent les conducteurs plus efficaces et plus fiables", a-t-il ajouté.

L'actuelle plate-forme Drive PX2 de Nvidia compte 225 clients, notamment des fabricants de voitures et de camions, des équipementiers automobiles, des entreprises de cartographie en haute définition, des startups et des instituts de recherche.

Le constructeur américain de véhicules électriques Tesla développe ses propres modèles autonomes, dont le dernier en date la Model 3. L'Audi A8 de Volkswagen est la première voiture à utiliser les fonctions de conduite semi-autonomes de niveau 3. Toyota Motor <7203.T> et le groupe automobile chinois Geely, propriétaire de la marque Volvo, y travaillent aussi.

Mais selon Luca De Ambroggi, la plate-forme Pegasus de Nvidia est la première à permettre aux constructeurs de développer des véhicules véritablement autonomes, qui peuvent être améliorés par la suite avec des logiciels avant le déploiement effectif sur route.

Il relève cependant que si Pegasus pourrait permettre la production de masse de robotaxis sur routes dédiées, la plate-forme est sans doute plus davantage adaptée pour la production seulement des prototypes de véhicules entièrement autonomes.

En outre, selon l'analyste d'IHS Markit, les questions liées à la réglementation, aux tests sur routes et à la sécurité sont également des freins à l'arrivée de tels véhicules, dont le lancement véritable n'aura pas lieu avant au moins 2025.

VORSCHAU-Europa nimmt Anlauf für eigene Batterieproduktion - Reuters (German)

{{20171010T104042.974+0000}}VORSCHAU-Europa nimmt Anlauf für eigene Batterieproduktion* Erster "Batteriegipfel" am Mittwoch in Brüssel

* Europa will asiatischen Herstellern die Stirn bieten

* Unternehmen scheuen noch die hohen Kosten

- von Jan Schwartz

Hamburg, 10. Okt (Reuters) - Die europäische Industrie lotet erstmals gemeinsam Möglichkeiten einer Fertigung von Batteriezellen aus, um den dominierenden Herstellern aus Asien etwas entgegenzusetzen. Dazu treffen sich am Mittwoch Vertreter mehrerer Schwergewichte aus der Automobil-, Chemie- und Technologiebranche auf Einladung der EU-Kommission zu einem Meinungsaustausch in Brüssel. Ziel des "Batteriegipfels" ist nach Worten des stellvertretenden Kommissionspräsidenten Maros Sefcovic, eine europäische Produktion von Batteriezellen aufzubauen, die über die gesamte Wertschöpfungskette bis zum Recycling reicht. Batteriezellen gelten als eine Schlüsseltechnologie für die Elektromobilität.

Die großen Autobauer wollen in den nächsten Jahren viele neue Elektroautos auf die Straßen bringen. Sie reagieren damit auf den Druck der Politik, die Schadstoffemissionen zu reduzieren. Länder wie Indien, Frankreich oder Großbritannien wollen Verbrennungsmotoren ab 2030 oder 2040 sogar ganz verbieten.[nL8N1MA42S]

Bislang dominieren bei Batteriezellen für Stromautos Unternehmen aus Japan, Südkorea und China wie Panasonic<6752.T>, NEC<6701.T>, LG<003550.KS>, Samsung<005930.KS> und BYD<002594.SZ>. Der US-Elektroautobauer Tesla stampft zusammen mit Panasonic in Nevada für fünf Milliarden Dollar eine Fabrik aus dem Boden, die ab 2020 Batterien und Akkupacks für stationäre Stromspeicher liefern soll.

ANALYSTEN SKEPTISCH

Dem haben europäische Firmen bisher kaum etwas entgegenzusetzen. Wollen sie nicht auf Jahre von Lieferanten aus Asien und den USA abhängig sein, müssen sie nach Meinung von Experten die Kräfte bündeln. Dazu hatte EU-Kommissionsvize Sefcovic jüngst aufgerufen.[nL8N1ME4HV] Die Aussichten auf den baldigen Beginn einer gemeinsamen Batteriezellenfertigung gelten jedoch als gering. Viele Hersteller scheuen die Kosten einer eigenen Produktion, weil noch nicht klar ist, welche Technologie sich durchsetzen wird. Analysten sind daher skeptisch, ob eine europäische Batterieallianz zustande kommt. "Man kann nicht erkennen, dass da Bewegung hineinkommt", sagt Jürgen Pieper vom Bankhaus Metzler. Er sei enttäuscht von den drei großen deutschen Autobauern BMW, Daimler und VW, dass die nicht mehr unternähmen. "Ich bin ganz klar der Meinung, die müssen in die Zellfertigung gehen. Das ist ein absoluter Kern des künftigen Autos, da spielt die Musik."

Um welche Dimensionen es bei dem bevorstehenden Schwenk in die Elektromobilität geht, zeigt Volkswagen. Europas größter Autokonzern will bis 2025 rund 50 rein batteriebetriebene Fahrzeuge und 30 Plug-in-Hybride ins Rollen bringen, die an der Steckdose aufgeladen werden. Um den enormen Bedarf an Batteriezellen zu decken, der mit dem Programm verbunden ist, hat der Konzern weltweit ein Beschaffungsvolumen von mehr als 50 Milliarden Euro ausgeschrieben - eines der größten in der Geschichte der Industrie. Dafür sucht Volkswagen Partner in China, Europa und Nordamerika. Der jährliche Bedarf entspreche der Jahreskapazität von mindestens vier "Gigafactories" für Batteriezellen, das Vierfache dessen, was Tesla baut.

AIRBUS FÜR BATTERIEN

VW-Markenchef Herbert Diess plädierte unlängst für eine europäische Batterieallianz. In einem Reuters-Interview sagte er, es wäre wünschenswert, dass sich die deutsche und europäische Industrie bei diesem Thema stärker engagiere. Die Produktion von Batteriezellen für Elektroautos sei eines der großen Wachstumsfelder.[nL5N1LU2XI] Der belgische Materialtechnologie- und Recyclingkonzern Umicore forderte gar einen "Airbus für Batterien".[nL8N1ME4HV]

Ob das gelingt, steht jedoch in den Sternen. Vieles dürfte von einer Förderung durch die EU abhängen. Die Branche streitet noch, ob man überhaupt in die Produktion gängiger Lithium-Ionen-Akkus einsteigen soll oder die nächste Generation von Batteriezellen (Festkörperakkus) abwartet, die ab Mitte des nächsten Jahrzehnts zur Verfügung stehen sollen. Auch ist offen, ob die Hersteller das selbst in die Hand nehmen oder ihren Lieferanten überlassen. Diese Fragen dürften nach Angaben aus Industriekreisen bei dem Batteriegipfel im Mittelpunkt stehen. Von deutscher Seite werden daran nach Angaben des Branchenverbandes VDA Volkswagen, BMW und Daimler sowie die Lieferanten Bosch[ROBG.UL] und Continental teilnehmen. Zu den nach Brüssel eingeladenen Unternehmen zählen auch der französische Autobauer Renault sowie der Chemiekonzern BASF und der Münchner Siemens-Konzern.

POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street ouvre en hausse, records pour le Dow et le Nasdaq - Reuters (French)

{{20171009T135239.756+0000}}POINT MARCHÉS-Wall Street ouvre en hausse, records pour le Dow et le Nasdaq9 octobre (Reuters) - La Bourse de New York a ouvert lundi sur une légère hausse qui a suffi à l'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> et au Nasdaq pour inscrire de nouveaux records, les actions américaines continuant de profiter des espoirs placés dans le projet de réforme fiscale de l'administration Trump, avant le début de la saison des publications de résultats trimestriels.

Quelques minutes après le début des échanges, l'indice Dow Jones <.DJI> gagne 10,98 points, soit 0,05%, à 22.784,65. Le Standard & Poor's 500 <.SPX>, plus large, progresse de 0,02% à 2.549,96 et le Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> prend 0,1% à 6.596,58.

Le Dow a touché un plus haut à 22.803,37 et le Nasdaq a fait de même à 6.597,69.

Si les chiffres inférieurs aux attentes de l'emploi en septembre ont mis fin vendredi à une série de huit hausses consécutives pour le S&P 500, une partie des intervenants de marché continuent d'espérer que le Congrès finira par adopter une réforme de la fiscalité aux Etats-Unis, susceptible de favoriser la croissance des bénéfices, donc la hausse des actions.

En attendant, l'attention du marché se tourne vers les résultats de sociétés, appelés à animer les prochaines semaines à Wall Street.

Deux poids lourds du secteur bancaire, JPMorgan Chase et Citigroup , doivent publier leurs comptes jeudi, avant Bank of America et Wells Fargo , vendredi.

Dans une note publiée ce lundi, les analystes de JPMorgan disent s'attendre pour le secteur à des résultats mitigés en raison de la très faible croissance du crédit, d'une hausse limitée des marges d'intérêt et d'une baisse des revenus des activités de marchés. [L8N1MK3V4]

Les profits de l'ensemble du S&P 500 sont attendus en hausse moyenne de 4,9% au troisième trimestre, selon les derniers chiffres de Thomson Reuters, ce qui marquerait un ralentissement après deux trimestres de croissance à deux chiffres.

DISNEY MONTE, GENERAL ELECTRIC BAISSE

L'approche de la saison des résultats pourrait ainsi détourner les investisseurs des préoccupations géopolitiques, même si les échanges tendus se poursuivent entre les Etats-Unis et la Corée du Nord.

Le dirigeant nord-coréen Kim Jong-un a salué ce week-end la puissance de dissuasion de l'arsenal nucléaire de son pays, selon des propos diffusés par les médias d'Etat dimanche quelques heures après une nouvelle mise en garde de Donald Trump. [nL8N1MJ0BV]

Au moment de l'ouverture des marchés américains, les principales places boursières européennes évoluaient en ordre dispersé : à Paris, le CAC 40 <.FCHI> était stable et à Francfort, le Dax <.GDAXI> gagnait 0,1% tandis que l'indice large européen Stoxx 600 <.STOXX> progressait de 0,21%.

Sur le marché des changes, le dollar est en léger repli face à un panier de devises de référence <.DXY> mais reste proche du plus haut de deux mois et demi touché vendredi, la progression soutenue des salaires en septembre ayant conforté le scénario d'une hausse de taux de la Réserve fédérale mi-décembre.

Le marché obligataire américain, lui, est fermé pour la célébration du "Columbus Day".

Aux valeurs à Wall Street, Walt Disney prend 0,33%. RBC Capital Markets a intégré le géant des médias et du divertissement dans ses valeurs préférées.

A la baisse, General Electric cède 1,97% après l'annonce, vendredi après la clôture, du départ du directeur financier du conglomérat, Jeff Bornstein.

Tesla abandonne 1,69% après la décision du groupe de repousser à la mi-novembre la présentation de son premier poids lourd afin de privilégier la production de la berline Model 3 et l'aide à Porto Rico.

UPDATE 1-Google to use balloons to provide Puerto Rico cell service - Reuters News

{{20171007T015422.429+0000}}UPDATE 1-Google to use balloons to provide Puerto Rico cell service(Adds Tesla talking to Puerto Rico, FCC statement on task force)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Oct 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission said late on Friday it had approved Alphabet Inc's application to provide emergency cellular service to Puerto Rico through balloons.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico has struggled to regain communications services. The FCC said on Friday that 83 percent of cell sites remain out of service, while wireless communications company are deploying temporary sites.

Alphabet, which announced its Project Loon in 2013 to use solar-powered, high-altitude balloons to provide internet service in remote regions, said in an FCC filing it was working to "support licensed mobile carriers' restoration of limited communications capability" in Puerto Rico.

Earlier on Friday, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced he was forming a Hurricane Recovery Task Force with an emphasis on addressing challenges facing Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

"It is critical that we adopt a coordinated and comprehensive approach to support the rebuilding of communications infrastructure and restoration of communications services," Pai said in statement.

Separately, Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello said in a Twitter posting late on Friday that he had a "great initial conversation with @elonmusk tonight. Teams are now talking; exploring opportunities. Next steps soon to follow."

Musk, the chief executive of Tesla Inc , said on Friday the company would send more battery installers to Puerto Rico to help restore power after Hurricane Maria knocked out all power on the island over two weeks ago.

Musk said he was diverting resources from a semi-truck project to fix Model 3 bottlenecks and "increase battery production for Puerto Rico & other affected areas."

In late September, Tesla said it was sending hundreds of batteries that can store power generated by solar panels to Puerto Rico to provide emergency help in the wake of Hurricane Maria.

UPDATE 3-Tesla delays big rig truck debut; Model 3 in 'production hell' - Reuters News

{{20171007T002624.716+0000}}UPDATE 3-Tesla delays big rig truck debut; Model 3 in 'production hell'(New throughout, adds stock price, truck details, byline)

By Munsif Vengattil

Oct 6 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk on Friday pushed back the unveiling of the company's big rig truck until mid-November, tweeting that the electric vehicle maker was diverting resources to fix production bottlenecks of its new Model 3 sedan and to help Puerto Rico.

Musk said Tesla's Model 3 was "deep in production hell" echoing his own comments in July, when he showed off some of the first cars of that model.

The Model 3 could help Tesla approach its goal of becoming more of a mass market producer. Recent comments have tempered expectations about the speed of the increase in production, though.

Musk's comments came after the close of stock trading on Friday. The company's shares fell 0.8 percent in extended trading.

The Palo Alto, California-based company delivered just 220 Model 3 sedans and produced 260 in the third quarter. It had planned to produce more than 1,500.

Musk also tweeted the company was diverting resources to increasing battery production to help hurricane-hit Puerto Rico, where most residents remain without electricity.

Earlier this week Tesla reported that "production bottlenecks" had left it behind the planned ramp-up for the Model 3. [nL4N1MD4G4]

In response to a Tesla customer asking if he would get his car delivered this year, Musk tweeted, "December will be a big month, so probably, but it is impossible to be certain right now."

A Wall Street Journal report said parts of Model 3 were being made by hand as recently as early September, adding to production delays. (http://on.wsj.com/2kt5E17)

Musk also said Tesla would reschedule the unveiling of its semi-truck to Nov. 16 as it focuses on fixing production issues tied to Model 3 and increases battery production for Puerto Rico.

The unveiling of the truck, called Tesla Semi, has been delayed for the second time this year. Musk had initially said the truck would be unveiled in September, but he later rescheduled it to late October.

"Semi specs are better than anything I've seen reported so far. Semi eng/design team work is aces, but other needs are greater right now," Elon replied to a twitter user who asked him about the specifications of the semi-truck.

Reuters in August reported that the truck would have a working range of 200-300 miles. [nL2N1LA0XJ]

Tesla will Elektro-Lkw nun erst Mitte November präsentieren  - Reuters (German)

{{20171006T234314.332+0000}}Tesla will Elektro-Lkw nun erst Mitte November präsentieren Bangalore, 07. Okt (Reuters) - Der US-Elektroautobauer Tesla verschiebt erneut die Präsentation seines Sattelzugs. Die Präsentation sei nun für den 16. November vorgesehen, teilte Tesla-Chef Elon Musk am Freitag mit. Tesla hatte den Schritt ursprünglich für September angekündigt. Dann verschob das Unternehmen den Termin auf Ende Oktober. Tesla kämpft derzeit mit erheblichen Produktionsengpässen bei neuem Model 3. Zudem will Musk nach früheren Angaben in eineinhalb bis zwei Jahren einen Pickup präsentieren.

Musk hatte im Juli 2016 bei der Vorlage eines "Masterplans" erklärt, ein "Tesla Semi" - vom Englischen "semi truck" für "Sattelzug" - würde mehr Sicherheit bei geringeren Transportkosten bieten. Zudem kündigte er damals auch einen Bus für den öffentlichen Nahverkehr an. Bislang setzt Tesla auf die Sportlimousine Model S und das größere Model X.

Tesla to send more battery installers to Puerto Rico to restore power - Reuters News

{{20171006T190353.920+0000}}Tesla to send more battery installers to Puerto Rico to restore powerOct 6 (Reuters) - U.S. electric car and battery maker Tesla Inc's CEO Elon Musk said on Friday the company will send more battery installers to Puerto Rico to help restore power after Hurricane Maria knocked out all power on the island over two weeks ago.

Musk also said in a tweet that he looked forward to talking to Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello on Friday about what Tesla could do to help restore power.

"The internal Tesla Powerwall install team in (Puerto Rico) is very small right now. Sending experienced installers from continental U.S. to hire and train local team as fast as possible," Elon Musk said in a tweet, referring to the company's Powerwall battery system.

Tesla declined to comment further.

In late September, Tesla said it was sending hundreds of batteries that can store power generated by solar panels to Puerto Rico to provide emergency help in the wake of Hurricane Maria. [nL8N1MA6H7]

Maria struck Puerto Rico on Sept. 20 as a very dangerous Category 4 hurricane with winds up to 155 miles per hour (249 km per hour), cutting off power to all 3.4 million residents on the island.

As of Thursday, Puerto Rico's power company, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), had restored power to only about 9 percent of the island's electric customers.

In response to a request for help from Rossello on Thursday, Musk said in a tweet "I would be happy to talk. Hopefully, Tesla can be helpful."

The governor said in a tweet to Musk "Let's talk. Do you want to show the world the power and scalability of your (Tesla technologies)? (Puerto Rico) could be that flagship project."

Tesla has said it would pair batteries with solar panels to provide electricity without burning fossil fuels.

"The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too," Musk said in a tweet on Thursday.

"Such a decision would be in the hands of the (Puerto Rico government ... any commercial stakeholders and, most importantly, the people of (Puerto Rico)," Musk said.

Denso to invest $1 bln in Tennessee plant, create 1,000 jobs - Reuters News

{{20171006T152807.081+0000}}Denso to invest $1 bln in Tennessee plant, create 1,000 jobs(.)

By Nick Carey

DETROIT, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Japanese auto parts supplier Denso Corp <6902.T> plans to invest $1 billion in its Maryville, Tennessee plant to develop vehicle electrification and safety systems, creating around 1,000 jobs.

This is the latest in a series of announcements from automakers rushing to bring a large number of electric vehicle models to market in the coming years.

Policymakers in key markets such as China are pushing a shift to electric cars from internal combustion engines over the next two to three decades, while relatively new rival Tesla Inc is gaining momentum, pressuring traditional automakers to crank up plans for fully electric vehicles.

Denso said in a statement the investment would expand multiple production lines at the facility to produce advanced safety, connectivity and electrification products for hybrid and electric vehicles. The new jobs will include production workers, technicians and engineers.

"We are seeing dramatic shifts in the role of transportation in society, and this investment will help position us to meet those changing demands," Kenichiro Ito, chairman of Denso's North American board, said in a statement.

In 2015 the auto supplier announced a $400 million investment in Maryville and the creation of 500 jobs.

Last week, Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T> announced a joint venture with partner Mazda Motor Corp <7261.T> to develop electric vehicle technology. Toyota will take a 90 percent stake in the joint venture while Mazda and Denso, Toyota's biggest supplier, will each take 5 percent. [nL4N1M91ER]

No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co said this week it would add 20 new battery electric and fuel cell vehicles to its global lineup by 2023. [nL2N1MD1YS]

A day later, Ford Motor Co said it planned to slash $14 billion in costs over the next five years and shift capital investment away from sedans and internal combustion engines to develop more trucks and electric and hybrid cars.

UPDATE 1-Boeing-backed, hybrid-electric commuter plane to hit market in 2022 - Reuters News

{{20171005T190456.035+0000}}UPDATE 1-Boeing-backed, hybrid-electric commuter plane to hit market in 2022(Adds details about aircraft, strategy)

By Alwyn Scott

NEW YORK, Oct 5 (Reuters) - A Seattle-area startup, backed by the venture capital arms of Boeing Co and JetBlue Airways Corp announced plans on Thursday to bring a small hybrid-electric commuter aircraft to market by 2022.

The small airliner is the first of several planes planned by Zunum Aero, which said it would seat up to 12 passengers and be powered by two electric motors, dramatically reducing the travel time and cost of trips under 1,000 miles (1,600 km).

Zunum's plans and timetable underscore a rush to develop small electric aircraft based on rapidly evolving battery technology and artificial intelligence systems that avoid obstacles on a road or in the sky.

In a separate but related development, Boeing said on Thursday it plans to acquire a company that specializes in electric and autonomous flight to help its own efforts to develop such aircraft. [nL4N1MG2JV]

Several companies, including Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and European planemaker Airbus , are working on electric-powered self-flying cars. [nL4N1HX5DG] [nL5N1F62CF]

Zunum does not expect to be the first to certify an electric-powered aircraft with regulators. Rather, it is aiming to fill a market gap for regional travel by airlines, where private jets and commercial jetliners are too costly for many to use.

Zunum's planes would fly from thousands of small airports around big cities to cut regional travel times and costs.

"Airlines are very keen to know how to fly a shorter distance and make money on it," Matt Knapp, co-founder and chief aeronautic engineer of the Kirkland, Washington-based company, said in an interview.

A flight from Silicon Valley to Los Angeles, for instance, would leave from Palo Alto, San Carlos, Hayward or Reid Hillview airports and arrive in Santa Monica, Burbank, Hawthorne or San Gabriel Valley airports. The cost would be about $120 one way, the company said.

The travel time of over four hours would be cut in half by avoiding the crowds and security lines at big hubs that are required for larger planes. About 96 percent of U.S. air traffic travels through 1 percent of its airports, leaving thousands of small airports virtually untapped, Knapp said.

Electric-vehicle batteries, such as those made by Tesla Inc and Panasonic Corp <6752.T>, would power Zunum's motors, although Zunum has no commitment with either company. A supplemental jet-fuel engine and electrical generator would be used to give the plane a range of 700 miles and ensure it stays aloft after the batteries are exhausted, Knapp said

Zunum plans to make a larger plane seating up to 50 passengers at the end of the next decade, and the range of both would increase to about 1,000 miles as battery technology improves, Knapp said.

The planes eventually would fly solely on battery power, and are being designed to fly with one pilot and to eventually be remotely piloted, he added.

Recent advances in battery technology, lightweight electric motors and carbon composite airframes would cut the cost of flying Zunum's aircraft to about eight cents per seat-mile, about one-fifth that of a small jet or turboprop plane, Knapp said.

"We're getting airline pricing down on a small plane and doing it for short distances," Knapp said. "That kind of aircraft doesn't currently exist."

Zunum first announced its plans for hybrid-electric aircraft in April, and revealed that Boeing HorizonX and JetBlue Technology Ventures had invested in its initial round of venture funding. On Thursday it disclosed specifications and a timetable for the vehicle entering service.

Zunum says the plane would cruise at about 340 miles an hour and at altitudes of about 25,000 feet (7,600 meters) - slower and lower than conventional jets.

The motor, which Zunum is designing, will drive a fan similar to the bypass fan on a jet engine, but without a jet's combustion. Zunum has started talks with plane makers about building the airframe, and it is building non-flying prototypes of the powertrain to test batteries, the electrical system, software and other components, Knapp said.

Current battery technology can only power the plane for about 100 miles so a gas-powered engine would be used to generate electricity to power the motors for additional range.

Boeing-backed, electric-hybrid airliner set to hit market in 2022 - Reuters News

{{20171005T110001.164+0000}}Boeing-backed, electric-hybrid airliner set to hit market in 2022By Alwyn Scott

NEW YORK, Oct 5 (Reuters) - A Seattle-area startup backed by the venture arms of Boeing Co and JetBlue Airways Corp plans to bring a small hybrid-electric airliner to market by 2022 that can dramatically reduce the travel time and cost of trips under 1,000 miles (1,600 km), it said on Thursday.

The first of several aircraft planned by Zunum Aero would seat up to 12 passengers and be powered by two electric motors.

Electric-vehicle batteries, such as those made by Tesla Inc and Panasonic Corp <6752.T>, would power the motor. A supplemental gas engine and electrical generator would be used to give the plane a range of 700 miles, Matt Knapp, co-founder and chief aeronautic engineer of the Kirkland, Washington-based company, said in an interview.

Zunum has no commitment to Tesla or Panasonic.

A larger plane seating up to 50 passengers would follow at the end of the next decade, and the range of both would increase to about 1,000 miles as battery technology improves, Knapp said.

The planes eventually would fly solely on battery power, and are being designed to fly with one pilot and to eventually be remotely piloted, he added.

Several companies, including Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and European planemaker Airbus , are working on intra-urban electric-powered self-flying cars. [nL4N1HX5DG] [nL5N1F62CF]

Zunum does not expect to be the first to certify an electric-powered aircraft with regulators. It is aiming to fill a market for regional travel for airlines, where private jets and commercial jetliners are too costly for many to use.

"Airlines are very keen to know how to fly a shorter distance and make money on it," Knapp said.

Recent advances in electric-vehicle and autonomous technology, along with lightweight electric motors and carbon composite airframes would reduce the cost of flying Zunum's aircraft to about 8 cents per seat-mile, about one-fifth that of a small jet or turboprop plane, Knapp said.

"We're getting airline pricing down on a small plane and doing it for short distances," Knapp said. "That kind of aircraft doesn't currently exist."

Zunum announced plans for electric-hybrid aircraft in April, and revealed that Boeing HorizonX and JetBlue Technology Ventures had invested in its initial round of venture funding. On Thursday it disclosed specifications and a timetable for the vehicle entering service.

Zunum says the plane would cruise at about 340 miles an hour and at altitudes of about 25,000 feet (7,600 meters) - slower and lower than jets.

The plane would cut travel time by allowing passengers to fly from thousands of regional airports, avoiding big hubs used by major airlines and airport security required for larger planes. About 96 percent of U.S. air traffic travels through 1 percent of its airports, Zunum said.

Current battery technology can only power the plane for about 100 miles so a gas-powered engine is used to generate electricity to power the motors for additional range.

UPDATE 3-U.S. Senate panel puts self-driving cars in fast lane - Reuters News

{{20171004T222750.462+0000}}UPDATE 3-U.S. Senate panel puts self-driving cars in fast lane(New throughout, adds Teamsters reaction, GM report)

By David Shepardson

WASHINGTON, Oct 4 (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate panel on Wednesday unanimously gave the green light to a bill aimed at speeding the use of self-driving cars without human controls, a measure that also bars states from imposing regulatory road blocks.

The bill still must clear a Senate vote, but it appears on track to passage. This should rev up profits for automakers, technology companies and ride service providers, hastening the day when their robot cars can carry passengers on the same U.S. roads as cars driven by people.

General Motors Co , Alphabet Inc , Ford Motor Co and others have lobbied for the landmark legislation, while auto safety groups urged more safeguards and have pledged to keep fighting for changes.

However the measure will not speed the process for self-driving commercial trucks, which remain in a slower lane despite support from several Republican senators.

The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee approved the bill, and the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously passed a similar measure last month. Automakers would be able to win exemptions from safety rules that require human controls. States could set rules on registration, licensing, liability, insurance and safety inspections, but not performance standards.

Senator John Thune, the Republican who chairs the Commerce Committee, said the bill "underscores the bipartisan desire to move ahead with self-driving vehicle technology.... The safety and economic benefits of self-driving vehicles are too critical to delay."

Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, sought to amend the bill to require human controls in case of emergency, but dropped that proposal. Some senators argued it would be more dangerous to allow human drivers to seek to take over driverless cars.

Even with the legislative victory, developers of self-driving technology face technical challenges. There are also the complications of driverless vehicles sharing the road with human drivers. GM told California its self-driving cars were involved in six crashes in September. The accidents were all minor, and the automaker has blamed them on human drivers and one bicyclist who hit its self-driving vehicles. [nL2N1MF1RO]

Neither the House nor the Senate bill would speed approval of self-driving technology for vehicles over 10,000 pounds, a step pushed by trucking organizations. Labor unions raised safety and employment concerns, and Democrats resisted that part of the proposal.

Teamsters President Jim Hoffa said the "safe development of advanced heavy trucking technology must encapsulate the life-and-death issues that are specific to that industry, not consider such consequences as an inconvenient after-thought." He said Congress should also consider U.S. jobs.

Tesla Inc , Alphabet, Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and others have said they are working on self-driving trucks.

After lengthy negotiations, congressional aides added language to the bill aimed at preserving legal rights to sue over defective vehicles. This resolved a dispute that threatened to derail the bill.

Within three years, the bill would allow automakers to each sell up to 80,000 self-driving vehicles annually if they could demonstrate they are as safe as current vehicles. Auto safety advocates complained it lacked sufficient safeguards.

The phase-in schedule was revised to initially allow 15,000 per manufacturer in the first year and up to 80,000 after three years, down from 50,000 to start and up to 100,000 in three years. It would eliminate the cap after four years.

The bill grants the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) authority to exempt vehicles from federal safety requirements and the agency would have to make a determination within six months of getting a request.

The Self-Driving Coalition, a group of automakers, tech firms and advocates for the disabled, said the legislation "will help ensure that the United States leads the world in self-driving innovation."

Under the measure, NHTSA must write permanent rules on self-driving cars within a decade and regulators must study how to encourage U.S. production of self-driving equipment and also look at the impact of self-driving vehicles on infrastructure, traffic congestion and fuel consumption.

Companies would need to disclose what information self-driving cars are collecting about individuals and how it is used. Companies would need to disclose if consumers could opt out of data collection.

UPDATE 2-EXCLUSIVE-VW seeks to curb competition from Skoda - sources - Reuters News

{{20171004T180816.910+0000}}UPDATE 2-EXCLUSIVE-VW seeks to curb competition from Skoda - sources* VW's Diess seeks to limit competition from Skoda - sources

* German unions want Skoda production at VW plants - source

* Labour reps also challenging cost-sharing terms - source

(Adds Czech union comment)

By Andreas Cremer

BERLIN, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Volkswagen managers and unions are seeking to curb competition from lower-cost stablemate Skoda, move some of its production to Germany and make the Czech brand pay more for shared technology, company sources told Reuters.

As VW struggles to cut jobs and spending at German factories and turn the page on dieselgate, Skoda's superior car reviews and profitability have intensified the brands' rivalry within the Volkswagen empire.

VW now wants to reduce what it sees as Skoda's unfair advantages - combining German technology with cheaper labour - and reaffirm the top-selling brand's primacy ahead of a wave of new electric car launches, the sources said.

The tussle between VW and Skoda is reviving tensions at the heart of the Volkswagen group between profits and jobs, and between central control and autonomy for its 12 vehicle brands.

"Instead of devoting our efforts to beating Tesla , we may just be setting up a futile internal conflict," said one manager.

Once the butt of jokes, Skoda has blossomed under 26 years of VW group ownership into a successful mid-market carmaker, steadily winning business from rivals - including VW - and surpassing even Audi's operating profit margin last year.

At the same time, VW is facing thousands of job cuts as management moves to trim excess capacity at German factories. Its powerful domestic unions see Skoda's success as both a threat and a potential lifeline. [nL8N1DJ0NS]

VW workers' representatives are now demanding the transfer of some Skoda production to their underused German plants, a source close to the supervisory board told Reuters. The proposal aims to offset declining output of the VW Passat and ageing Golf that could otherwise threaten more jobs.

They are also making the case that Skoda should pay higher royalties to use VW's main common vehicle platform. The so-called MQB architecture also underpins mid-sized models from the group's Audi and SEAT brands.

Responding to the news, Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said he would meet Skoda management and unions to ask for clarification. [nP7N1HE01G]

The government will seek to ensure that VW investment plans are followed through and that "production is not moved outside the country", a statement released by Sobotka's office said.

Skoda's main union warned that a production shift could cost as many as 2,000 jobs. VW's works council declined to comment.

VW brand Chief Executive Herbert Diess is leading a parallel management effort to shield future VW models from direct competition with cheaper Skodas.

At a recent group executive committee meeting, Diess called for greater differentiation between VW and Skoda target markets and clientele, particularly for future electric models, three managers with knowledge of the matter said.

"The future positioning of brands is being looked at, but discussions are still ongoing," a VW group spokesman said, declining further comment.

Tension is expected to rise ahead of a Nov. 17 supervisory board session due to approve annual investment budgets across the world's biggest carmaker.

LABOUR ADVANTAGE

Skoda's operating profit more than doubled over three years to 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in 2016, lifting its profit margin to 8.7 percent - second only to Porsche within the Volkswagen stable.

The VW brand, whose margin dipped to 1.8 percent after earnings fell by a third, still outsells Skoda globally but is growing more slowly in Europe.

Skoda's healthy profits partly reflect the shared car platform's economies of scale. Designed by VW engineers in Germany, MQB has been rolled out progressively since 2012.

But Skoda gets a further boost from cheaper labour. Manufacturing wages average 10.10 euros per hour in the Czech Republic, where most of its European cars are assembled, compared with 38.70 euros in German industry, according to Berlin's official statistics office.

How VW group CEO Matthias Mueller might resolve the dispute remains unclear. The clout of the German unions, which hold half of the company's 20 board seats, means Skoda's success may be viewed more as a problem than a model to emulate.

The German state of Lower Saxony, which occupies another two board seats, is also preoccupied with preserving VW jobs.

Unease at VW's Wolfsburg headquarters has been compounded by car reviews in which its models have sometimes lost face to cheaper Skoda cousins sharing the MQB platform.

The new Skoda Kodiaq sports-utility vehicle (SUV) is priced 1,500 euros ($1,765) below the VW Tiguan yet trumped the German brand in a quality survey by Auto Motor und Sport magazine. Skoda's Superb also drew favourable comparisons with the Passat.

Skoda denies any deliberate encroachment on VW's turf.

"We mainly attract customers from outside the VW group and that is also our mission," brand CEO Bernhard Maier told Reuters in a interview.

ELECTRIC FUTURE

Competition for resources among VW brands is nothing new. Unions lobbied for VW to lead development of emerging-market cars, but Skoda was allowed to take charge.

Now the group's 20 billion euro push to launch 50 electric cars by 2025 has brought tensions to a head as VW managers fear their battery-powered models may also be undercut, people with knowledge of the discussions said.

"The electric vehicle market is a new ball game where you cannot simply maintain the brands' positioning," said one. "Customers need to see that you are making changes."

VW and Skoda both plan to introduce coupe-styled electric SUVs in 2020 boasting the same 500 km (300 mile) range.

Any renegotiation of platform cost-sharing could also affect each brand's contribution to the new MEB platform being developed for electric cars.

In public, however, VW has played down the rivalry. With a combined lineup approaching 100 vehicles, brand CEO Diess said, there is always some risk of stepping on toes.

"There will always be some substitution," he told Reuters. "But some internal competition is also helpful." ($1 = 0.8491 euros)

{{20171004T142440.476+0000}}ANALYSIS-German carmakers relying on volume to confront Tesla* BMW and Mercedes facing up to Tesla

* German firms defy sceptics over design needs

* Easy to build electric car, hard to make money

By Edward Taylor

FRANKFURT, Oct 4 (Reuters) - BMW and Mercedes are betting they can mass produce new electric cars based on conventional vehicles, defying sceptics who say they will need more radical designs to head off the threat from Tesla and other start-up carmakers.

There are two ways to make battery-driven vehicles: use a clean-sheet design like Tesla , or a traditional vehicle platform that can use all types of motor: combustion, electric or a hybrid of the two.

Electric motors are smaller than petrol or diesel engines, so electric vehicles designed from scratch can benefit from better interior packaging which allows a bigger passenger space. The problem: their unique design requires a dedicated production line and expensive new factories.

BMW learned this the hard way after pouring billions into bespoke carbon-fibre based electric cars, the i3 and i8, which failed to sell in large numbers.

"It is easy to build an electric car. It is difficult to earn money with it," said BMW research and development chief Klaus Froehlich.

Since BMW started selling the i3 in 2013, vehicle battery performance has improved by 40 percent, allowing carmakers to make electric cars with the same heavy underpinnings used by petrol cars and still get a range of 500 km from one charge.

This, they believe, gives them an advantage over makers of custom built electric vehicles.

As Tesla enters the mainstream with its cheaper Model 3, BMW has made a strategy u-turn to produce electric cars in large numbers, pledging to offer battery-powered variants of regular models.

Froehlich said vehicle designs dedicated to only one powertrain were no longer required.

BMW is preparing to launch an all-electric version of its popular X3 offroader by 2020, and Mercedes-Benz will launch the electric EQ in 2019, based on its best-selling SUV, the GLC.

A new electric BMW, the i Vision Concept, will use the same underpinnings as future versions of the BMW 3-Series.

Electric and petrol versions will be built on the same production lines, allowing a flexible response to demand for electric vehicles.

To prolong the life of its i3, BMW has given it a fresh design and a new battery. But the company's strategic bet is on overhauling volume production lines to rapidly scale up production if needed.

Demand for electric cars remains weak due to their high purchase price and limited charging infrastructure. But this may change if battery prices keep falling.

"Battery costs are coming down. We believe that we can bring economies of scale to bear beyond just the battery and drivetrain. I think we will be in a good competitive position from that perspective," Daimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche, whose company owns Mercedes-Benz, told Reuters.

Mercedes is also working on a platform just for electric and autonomous cars, to be introduced after its initial wave of electric vehicles hit the road.

Germany's three big premium carmakers - Mercedes, BMW and VW Group's Audi - have most to lose if Tesla's volume assault on the premium car market succeeds.

Loss-making Tesla, which made 83,922 cars last year, is already far ahead of the German luxury brands in electric car sales. BMW sold 25,528 electric i3's last year and Mercedes won't disclose sales figures for its electric B-Class. Overall, Mercedes and BMW sold more than 2 million cars apiece last year.

The Germans long resisted mass electrification, saying no competitor could make electric cars at a profit because the batteries were too expensive. Battery prices have slumped but a 500-km battery still costs $14,000, while a combustion engine is less than $5,000, analysts at Bernstein Research calculate.

"FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED"

Carsten Breitfeld, chief executive of start-up Chinese carmaker Byton, says vehicles must be rethought to unlock their potential, both as new electric cars and as platforms for a new consumer experience.

"Trying to adapt a volume architecture to produce electric, diesel and plug-in hybrids is fundamentally flawed, because these products will be compromised," Breitfeld told Reuters.

Breitfeld used to be a top electric vehicle engineer at BMW, where he headed the i8 sportscar programme before he defected, believing that volume carmakers were no longer setting the pace in electric vehicle design.

Breitfeld sees the German carmakers' answer to the expected surge in electric car demand - putting an electric motor in a conventional car - as a mistake. He believes it leaves the industry vulnerable to a 'Nokia moment': when a new player uses a transformational design to seize control of an established market, as Apple's iPhone stole a march on Finnish mobile phone giant Nokia a decade ago.

"Tesla was pathbreaking with its electric car, and that's what everybody is seeking to develop now. The next step is the connected car, which gives consumers a completely new digital experience. That's equivalent to a step from the Nokia to a smartphone," Breitfeld said.

Breitfeld is so convinced of this that he left his job at BMW in 2015, where he was part of a small team working on clean sheet electric cars - a project that caught the attention of Apple.

BMW and Apple explored a partnership on cars in 2014, but ultimately went their separate ways.

Since then German carmakers have worked hard to marginalise the influence consumer electronics and technology companies could have over their vehicles, jointly buying digital mapping firm HERE as a way to reduce the industry's dependence on maps provided by Apple and Google .

Breitfeld says this defensive approach means carmakers are failing to take advantage of consumer electronics innovations.

By contrast, Byton vehicles are designed to take advantage of the "passenger economy": watching movies, chatting with friends or surfing the Internet while in your car.

"Apple created a platform and profits from every transaction made with their objects. We will offer content for our consumers," Breitfeld said of his strategy to make money from selling movies and other entertainment or services.

"For this you need a completely different architecture and computing power," Breitfeld said.

BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH

Car industry veterans caution that toppling incumbents may be harder than many consumer tech executives assume.

Harry Kroeger, a former director at Tesla and now president of automotive electronics at parts supplier Bosch , said plenty of tech companies had failed in the car business.

"I think there is a risk of a certain arrogance that you totally underestimate what kind of sophistication is in that good old fashioned hardware. There is 130 years of evolution in those parts and some of those lessons were learned the hard way," Kroeger told Reuters.

"A gadget, we don't care if that malfunctions, but we are talking about something which might run at 100 mph. Here you don't want a blue screen of death appearing," Kroeger said.

Truly disruptive design is further restrained by stringent safety regulations for cars. A chip controlling car brakes would not also be allowed to run an in-car infotainment system.

"It should not be that a malfunction in loading a song creates a braking manoeuvre," Kroeger said, adding that hackers have been able to manipulate a vehicle by breaking into its infotainment system.

Tesla may pose a threat to the Germans, but only if it can raise production to 500,000 cars by next year. And in the end, Silicon Valley may succeed in the car business by copying the Germans, rather than behaving like a start-up, Kroeger said.

"Tesla has thousands of old economy car guys," Kroeger said. "I think that's the secret why they managed to come up with a car."

EXCLUSIVE-VW seeks to curb competition from Skoda - sources - Reuters News

{{20171004T105805.783+0000}}EXCLUSIVE-VW seeks to curb competition from Skoda - sources* VW's Diess seeks to limit competition from Skoda - sources

* German unions want Skoda production at VW plants - source

* Labour reps also challenging cost-sharing terms - source

By Andreas Cremer

BERLIN, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Volkswagen managers and unions are seeking to curb competition from lower-cost stablemate Skoda, move some of its production to Germany and make the Czech brand pay more for shared technology, company sources told Reuters.

As VW struggles to cut jobs and spending at German factories and turn the page on dieselgate, Skoda's superior car reviews and profitability have intensified the brands' rivalry within the Volkswagen empire.

VW now wants to curb what it sees as Skoda's unfair advantages - combining German technology with cheaper labour - and reaffirm the top-selling brand's primacy ahead of a wave of new electric car launches, the sources said.

The tussle between VW and Skoda is reviving tensions at the heart of the Volkswagen group between profits and jobs, and between central control and autonomy for its 12 vehicle brands.

"Instead of devoting our efforts to beating Tesla , we may just be setting up a futile internal conflict," said one manager.

Once the butt of jokes, Skoda has blossomed under 26 years of VW group ownership into a successful mid-market carmaker, steadily winning business from rivals - including VW - and surpassing even Audi's operating profit margin last year.

At the same time, VW is facing thousands of job cuts as management moves to trim excess capacity at German factories. Its powerful domestic unions see Skoda's success as both a threat and a potential lifeline. [nL8N1DJ0NS]

VW workers' representatives are now demanding the transfer of some Skoda production to their underused German plants, a source close to the supervisory board told Reuters. The proposal aims to offset declining output of the VW Passat and ageing Golf that could otherwise threaten more jobs.

They are also making the case that Skoda should pay higher royalties to use VW's main common vehicle platform. The so-called MQB architecture also underpins mid-sized models from the group's Audi and SEAT brands.

VW's works council declined to comment.

VW brand Chief Executive Herbert Diess is leading a parallel management effort to shield future VW models from direct competition with cheaper Skodas.

At a recent group executive committee meeting, Diess called for greater differentiation between VW and Skoda target markets and clientele, particularly for future electric models, three managers with knowledge of the matter said.

"The future positioning of brands is being looked at, but discussions are still ongoing," a VW group spokesman said, declining further comment.

Tension is expected to rise ahead of a Nov. 17 supervisory board session due to approve annual investment budgets across the world's biggest carmaker.

LABOUR ADVANTAGE

Skoda's operating profit more than doubled over three years to 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in 2016, lifting its profit margin to 8.7 percent - second only to Porsche within the Volkswagen stable.

The VW brand, whose margin dipped to 1.8 percent after earnings fell by a third, still outsells Skoda globally but is growing more slowly in Europe.

Skoda's healthy profits partly reflect the shared car platform's economies of scale. Designed by VW engineers in Germany, MQB has been rolled out progressively since 2012.

But Skoda gets a further boost from cheaper labour. Manufacturing wages average 10.10 euros per hour in the Czech Republic, where most of its European cars are assembled, compared with 38.70 euros in German industry, according to Berlin's official statistics office.

How VW group CEO Matthias Mueller might resolve the dispute remains unclear. The clout of the German unions, which hold half of the company's 20 board seats, means Skoda's success may be viewed more as a problem than a model to emulate.

The German state of Lower Saxony, which occupies another two board seats, is also preoccupied with preserving VW jobs.

Unease at VW's Wolfsburg headquarters has been compounded by car reviews in which its models have sometimes lost face to cheaper Skoda cousins sharing the MQB platform.

The new Skoda Kodiaq sports-utility vehicle (SUV) is priced 1,500 euros ($1,765) below the VW Tiguan yet trumped the German brand in a quality survey by Auto Motor und Sport magazine. Skoda's Superb also drew favourable comparisons with the Passat.

Skoda denies any deliberate encroachment on VW's turf.

"We mainly attract customers from outside the VW group and that is also our mission," brand CEO Bernhard Maier told Reuters in a interview.

ELECTRIC FUTURE

Competition for resources among VW brands is nothing new. Unions lobbied for VW to lead development of emerging-market cars, but Skoda was allowed to take charge.

Now the group's 20 billion euro push to launch 50 electric cars by 2025 has brought tensions to a head as VW managers fear their battery-powered models may also be undercut, people with knowledge of the discussions said.

"The electric vehicle market is a new ball game where you cannot simply maintain the brands' positioning," said one. "Customers need to see that you are making changes."

VW and Skoda both plan to introduce coupe-styled electric SUVs in 2020 boasting the same 500 km (300 mile) range.

Any renegotiation of platform cost-sharing could also affect each brand's contribution to the new MEB platform being developed for electric cars.

In public, however, VW has played down the rivalry. With a combined lineup approaching 100 vehicles, brand CEO Diess said, there is always some risk of stepping on toes.

"There will always be some substitution," he told Reuters. "But some internal competition is also helpful." ($1 = 0.8491 euros)

UPDATE 3-Tesla shares recover from bottleneck fears - Reuters News

{{20171003T173754.735+0000}}UPDATE 3-Tesla shares recover from bottleneck fears(Recasts after shares bounce back)

By Supantha Mukherjee

Oct 3 (Reuters) - Investors put aside worries about Tesla Inc meeting production targets for its Model 3 mass-market sedan to push the electric car maker's shares higher on Tuesday, overturning an initial drop of almost 3 percent.

Tesla stirred concern among some analysts and investors on Monday by producing just 260 of the 1,500 sedans it had promised in the third quarter, citing bottlenecks in production. [nL4N1MD4G4]

But a number of analysts from some of the major brokerages who have backed the stock through a 60 percent rise this year said the shortfalls were normal for a fledgling car company and offered an opportunity to buy the stock.

"Most auto launches have hiccups, and Tesla is no exception," Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note.

Tesla shares rose just over 1 percent in midday trading in New York.

The moves also followed a series of announcements by rival General Motors on its own electric car ambitions, which included a promise to take "bold steps" towards the first completely driverless vehicles.

Tesla, which warned when it launched the sedan in July that it was entering "manufacturing hell", is aiming to produce 5,000 a week by the end of the year.

"We see the 5k a week production goal to exit 2017 at risk given the lack of disclosure provided in fixing the 'handful' of subsystems that are taking longer than expected," said Cowen and Co analysts, who already rate Tesla an underperform.

"We remain negative on shares given the execution that is currently priced in despite anticipated competition and capital needs."

Tesla said that there were no fundamental issues with the Model 3 production or supply chain and production issues would be addressed in the near term.

"Although Model 3 deliveries were slightly below the range, production challenges were expected for the first quarter of Model 3 production, and we expect production to significantly increase in Q4," Baird analysts wrote in a note.

GM on Monday also outlined plans to add 20 new battery electric and fuel cell vehicles to its global lineup by 2023. [nL2N1MD1YS]

"In the coming months, we'll take the next bold steps in testing our autonomous technology as we lead the way to fully self-driving vehicles without any human driver as a backup," GM Chief Executive wrote in a blog post on Monday titled "Zero Crashes, Zero Emissions, Zero Congestion".

GM shares were up 2.8 percent at $43.34.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Ford is playing catch-up with General Motors - Reuters Breakingviews

{{20171003T150427.448+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Ford is playing catch-up with General Motors(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)

By Antony Currie

NEW YORK, Oct 3 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The race to be the first to deliver mass-produced electric and autonomous vehicles is heating up – and in Detroit, Ford is running a distant second. America's second-biggest automaker is set to unveil its latest strategy after markets close on Tuesday. But General Motors has already outpaced its rival.

At 7.8 times next year's earnings, Ford trades at a premium to GM's 7.1 times, even after its stock tanked by more than a third under former Chief Executive Mark Fields. Skepticism about GM's post-bankruptcy turnaround offset Ford's missed earnings targets, declining profitability and confusion about its plans for a connected, self-driving future.

New boss Jim Hackett's big fix has gotten off to a poor start. On Monday, Ford announced it was setting up a new unit, Team Edison, to "think big," "make quicker decisions" and "think holistically" about electric cars. Within hours, GM bested that, saying it would have 20 electric and hybrid vehicles on the road by 2023.

Ford's rival has also been tuning up expectations about driverless cars. Executives argue it's the only automaker running tests in an urban setting – San Francisco. It may have some robotaxis ready to hit the road before summer 2019, reckons Deutsche Bank. Running a fleet of driverless sedan-size cabs could allow carmakers to bring in multiples of the average revenue of $35,000 a car they currently get.

Ford's relatively stronger position in smaller cars than GM has become a liability as Americans have switched back to SUVs and trucks. Focusing its line-up – and by extension cutting costs – and outlining how it can compete in robotaxis should be high on Hackett's agenda. That ought to include explaining how Ford's transit vans might figure in driverless cities, points out Barclays.

Autonomous and electric vehicles may not hit the roads en masse or be profitable for years. And whatever Hackett cooks up, Ford is unlikely to get near the valuation multiple of Tesla , even after the latter's third-quarter production of its Model 3 came in at less than a fifth of its target.

Nonetheless, the stakes are high. Automakers need to show they know roughly where they're going without squandering capital. GM, with its shares hitting a record high, gets the joke. If Hackett cannot show Ford does, too, its premium to GM is under imminent threat.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Ford Motor will unveil new Chief Executive Jim Hackett's strategy for the automaker after stock markets close on Oct. 3.

- Ford has formed a team to speed up development of electric cars, with a brief to "think big," "make quicker decisions" and "look holistically" at the market, Sherif Marakby, vice president of autonomous vehicles and electrification, said on Oct. 2.

- General Motors the same day outlined plans to put 20 electric-battery and fuel-cell vehicles on the roads by 2023. These would include most if not all of the at least 10 hybrid or electric cars Chief Executive Mary Barra has pledged to introduce to the Chinese market by 2020.

- GM's shares closed at a record high $42.15 on Oct. 2, driven higher by a Deutsche Bank research note saying the automaker plans to have autonomous ride-sharing service in operation by 2020.

- Tesla delivered 26,150 cars in the third quarter, the electric-car maker reported on Oct. 2. Of these, 220 were the new Model 3. A total of 260 Model 3s were built in the quarter, well below the target of 1,500.

EU invites industry chiefs to plug into battery revolution - Reuters News

{{20171003T141648.907+0000}}EU invites industry chiefs to plug into battery revolutionBRUSSELS, Oct 3 (Reuters) - The European Union will host auto, chemical and engineering executives next week to discuss developing battery manufacturing in the bloc to compete with Asian and U.S. manufacturers.

German chemical group BASF , automakers Renault and Daimler and engineering firm Siemens are among those invited to Wednesday's gathering in Brussels.

European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said EU funding could support the creation of a consortium in the sector.

"Our ambition is to create real production in the EU – a full value chain, including recycling," Sefcovic said in an email to Reuters.

"Supporting the roll-out of batteries is simply an imperative if we are serious about the transition into e-mobility," he said.

German carmaker Volkswagen , Total unit Saft Group which makes batteries, automotive supplier Continental AG and materials technology group Umicore are among those to say they would attend the talks.

Europe needs an "Airbus for batteries", said Egbert Lox, vice president of Umicore, which makes materials for the car industry and rechargeable batteries.

"This is a good initiative at the right time," said a spokesman for Volkswagen, whose brand chief called for the industry to create a regional battery supplier last month. [nL5N1LU2VO]

European carmakers have plans to speed up their shift to zero-emissions motoring with electric vehicles in light of stricter EU regulation to meet the bloc's climate goals.

Although European carmakers assemble battery packs for electric cars, the region has no significant player in battery cells - the essential building blocks for the batteries that are now mostly made in Asia.

The market is dominated by Japanese firms Panasonic <6752.T> and NEC <6701.T>, Korea's LG <0519.KS> and Samsung <005930.KS> and China's BYD <002594.SZ> and CATL, as well as U.S. manufacturer Tesla .

If sales of electric vehicles rise, as many carmakers now expect, developing European cell capacity could cost as much as 30 bln dollars, analysts at Bernstein Research wrote in a note.

"How on earth can the industry build/buy/find enough batteries or raw materials if and when EV demand takes off? This is a critical missing piece of the puzzle," they wrote.

Demand for electric cars remains weak due to limited charging infrastructure and the high costs of purchasing a vehicle. But this may change depending on how quickly battery prices fall, having dropped by 18 percent in 2016 alone.

Tesla shares fall on warning of Model 3 bottleneck - Reuters News

{{20171003T120108.271+0000}}Tesla shares fall on warning of Model 3 bottleneckOct 3 (Reuters) - Shares in Tesla Inc were down 2 percent in trading before the bell on Tuesday after the luxury electric vehicle maker said its planned ramp-up for the new Model 3 mass-market sedan faced production bottlenecks.

Tesla, which began production of the Model 3 in July, has so far delivered just 220 of those sedans and produced 260 during the quarter. [nL4N1MD4G4]

The production of 260 Model 3 sedans in the quarter was far below the 1,500 target and Tesla's production goal of 5,000 a week by end of this year 2017 is at risk, Cowen and Co analysts wrote in a research note on Monday.

UPDATE 1-GM promises more electric vehicles, paid for by SUVs - Reuters News

{{20171002T210913.159+0000}}UPDATE 1-GM promises more electric vehicles, paid for by SUVs(Adds GM share price reaching post-IPO high, details on Deutsche Bank comments)

By Joseph White

DETROIT, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Detroit automaker General Motors Co outlined plans on Monday to add 20 new battery electric and fuel cell vehicles to its global lineup by 2023, financed by robust profits from sales of gasoline-fueled trucks and sport utility vehicles in the United States and China.

"General Motors believes in an all-electric future," GM global product development chief Mark Reuss said during a briefing at the company's suburban Detroit technical center.

Future generations of GM electric vehicles "will be profitable," Reuss said, but added it was not clear when GM could make all its new vehicle offerings zero-emission electric cars.

GM shares closed on Monday at $42.15, the highest level since the company's 2010 post-bankruptcy initial public offering.

Investors pushed up GM shares ahead of the electric vehicle announcement on a Deutsche Bank comment that the automaker plans to deploy autonomous vehicles in ride services by 2020.

GM indicated last month it is nearly ready to begin mass production of autonomous Chevrolet Bolt vehicles. [nL2N1MD17E][nL1N1EA21I]

Regulators in China and some European countries have floated proposals to ban internal combustion engines by 2030 or 2040.

"We will continue to make sure our internal combustion engines will get more and more efficient," Reuss said.

Automakers, including electric vehicle market leader Tesla Inc , lose money on electric cars because battery costs are still higher than comparable internal combustion engines.

GM funds its forays into new technology using cash generated by old-technology vehicles popular with its core customer base in the U.S. heartland. In comparison, Tesla has burned through an estimated $10 billion in cash and has yet to show a full-year profit.

GM earned more than 90 percent of its $12.5 billion in pretax profits last year in North America, amid robust demand for its lineup of large sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. The company's profitable operations in China rely on consumer demand for an expanding lineup of gasoline-powered SUVs.

GM has previously announced plans to make some of its future electric vehicles capable of driving themselves in robot taxi fleets. The company offered sneak peeks of three electric vehicle prototypes: a Buick brand sport utility vehicle, a sporty Cadillac wagon and a futuristic pod car wearing a Bolt badge.

GM collaborated with Korean battery maker LG Chem <051910.KS> to build the Bolt battery system. Company officials did not say what companies would supply batteries for the larger fleet of vehicles promised by 2023.

Fuel cell vehicles will also play a role in GM's future, the company said. GM showed on Monday a prototype of a rolling, hydrogen-fueled platform called SURUS that could be used for multiple purposes.

The company plans to offer a fuel cell vehicle to retail customers within five years, it said. Toyota Motor Corp <7203.T>, Honda Motor Co <7267.T> and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS> already are marketing fuel cell vehicles in low volume.

GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said last month the company plans to introduce at least 10 new electric or hybrid vehicles to the Chinese market by 2020, and open a battery plant this year with Chinese partner SAIC Motor Corp Ltd <600104.SS>.

China has set goals for electric and plug-in hybrid cars to make up at least a fifth of auto sales by 2025. Some of the electric vehicles GM will offer in China are among the 20 Reuss promised by 2023.[nL4N1LW25D]

GM also hinted that it may take new steps to expand the public infrastructure for rapid recharging of electric vehicles, without offering any details.

The No. 1 U.S. automaker joins several rivals, including German automakers Daimler AG, Volkswagen AG and BMW AG, that have pledged to accelerate development of electric vehicles.

GM's announcement comes two days before rival Ford Motor Co is scheduled to roll out a new strategic plan, and as Tesla ramps up production of its high-volume Model 3 electric sedan.[nL5N1LT47Z]

GM promet davantage de véhicules électriques  - Reuters (French)

{{20171002T164710.437+0000}}GM promet davantage de véhicules électriques DETROIT, 2 octobre (Reuters) - General Motors a annoncé lundi son intention d'ajouter 20 nouveaux véhicules électriques ou à pile à combustible dans sa gemme d'ici 2023, financés par les profits robustes de ses camions et SUV à essence aux Etats-Unis et en Chine.

"General Motors croit en un avenir tout électrique", a déclaré Mark Reuss, directeur du développement des produits de GM, lors d'un point de presse au centre technique du constructeur dans la banlieue de Detroit.

Les générations futures de véhicules électriques GM "seront rentables", a-t-il dit sans préciser à quelle échéance l'ensemble de la gamme du constructeur serait disponible en version électrique. "Et nous continuerons de faire en sorte que nos moteurs à combustion soient de plus en plus efficients", a-t-il ajouté.

Le géant de Detroit rejoint ainsi la cohorte de constructeurs, dont les allemands Daimler , Volkswagen et BMW , qui se sont engagés à accélérer le développement de véhicules électriques en réponse aux initiatives de la Chine et de plusieurs pays européens visant à interdire les moteurs thermiques à l'horizon de 2030 ou 2040.

Le concurrent Ford , qui doit présenter mercredi un nouveau plan stratégique, a de son côté annoncé lundi la formation d'une équipe au niveau mondial pour accélérer le développement de ses voitures électriques. Cette "Team Edison", placée sous la responsabilité d'un "directeur mondial de l'électrification", Ted Cannis, aura pour mission d'identifier et de mettre en oeuvre des partenariats avec d'autres entreprises, y compris des fournisseurs.

A Wall Street, l'action GM a atteint lundi un nouveau record à 42,88 dollars, portée par une note positive de Rod Lache, analyste de Deutsche Bank. Après une rencontre avec la direction, celui-ci a écrit que le constructeur pourrait faire rouler des voitures autonomes à une grande échelle dès 2020.

Le titre conserve un gain de 4,12% à 42,05 dollars vers 16h40 GMT. Ford avance pour sa part de 0,54% tandis que Tesla recule de 1,01%, portant son recul à 12% depuis son plus haut record du 18 septembre.

The No. 1 U.S. automaker joins several rivals, including German automakers Daimler AG, Volkswagen AG and BMW AG, that have pledged to accelerate development of electric vehicles, in response to proposals in China and several European countries to ban internal combustion engines by 2030 or 2040.

GM's announcement comes just two days before rival Ford Motor Co is scheduled to roll out a new strategic plan, and as Tesla Inc ramps up production of its high-volume Model 3 electric sedan.[nL5N1LT47Z]
