UPDATE 3-ConocoPhillips trims capex after posting quarterly loss - Reuters News

{{20170727T174115.281+0000}}UPDATE 3-ConocoPhillips trims capex after posting quarterly loss(Adds conference call details, updates stock)

By Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, July 27 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips cut its 2017 capital spending by 4 percent on Thursday, the latest U.S. oil and natural gas producer to do so in reaction to depressed crude prices.

Conoco and its peers had mapped out ambitious capital spending programs for 2017 early in the year, expecting oil prices to be higher than where they are today, just under $50 per barrel.

But Conoco became the latest this week to cut its spending plans, after Hess Corp , Anadarko Petroleum Corp and others.[nL1N1KI0V4]

"This is the right approach for value creation in the upstream sector, especially at a time of uncertainty in the commodity markets," Conoco Chief Executive Officer Ryan Lance said in a statement.

Conoco now plans to spend $4.8 billion this year, down from a prior estimate of $5 billion. The cut came after Conoco reported its quarterly loss more than tripled despite recent asset sales.

Shares of the Houston-based company rose 1.2 percent to $44.21 in afternoon trading as oil prices traded slightly higher .

Conoco has aggressively moved to sell assets and cull debt in the past year, steps praised by Wall Street. The company repaid $3 billion in debt during the quarter and expects to pay off $2.4 billion by the end of the year, which would bring its debt load under $20 billion.

Conoco's net loss widened to $3.4 billion, or $2.78 per share, in the quarter, from $1.1 billion, or 78 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.

Excluding one-time items, the company earned 14 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected a loss of 2 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The results reflect a "solid quarter" for Conoco, Simmons & Co analysts Guy Baber said in a note to clients.

Production fell 8 percent to 1.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.

Still, the company is growing aggressively in its U.S. shale operations, which should see "pretty strong production" through the end of the year, executives told investors on a Thursday conference call.

Conoco last month sold its Canadian oil sands and natural gas assets in March to Cenovus Energy Inc in a cash-and-stock deal worth about $13.3 billion. The price was widely seen as high, a boon for Conoco. [nL2N1H7108]

Conoco is the latest international oil major to pull back from northern Alberta's oil sands, among the most costly locations in the world to develop.[nL3N1KI3W8]

U.S. shale producers cutting budgets as oil prices lag - Reuters News

{{20170727T144309.267+0000}}U.S. shale producers cutting budgets as oil prices lagBy Ernest Scheyder

HOUSTON, July 27 (Reuters) - U.S. shale producers have started to trim their 2017 capital spending budgets, a tacit acknowledgement that such plans were too aggressive when crafted months ago before commodity prices weakened.

This week alone, Anadarko Petroleum Corp , ConocoPhillips , Whiting Petroleum Corp and Hess Corp cut a combined $750 million from their capex plans, each citing weaker-than-expected oil prices .

The quartet are just the first in a wave of oil industry earnings results expected over the next two weeks, with many analyst expecting peers including Noble Energy Inc and Marathon Oil Corp to cut their own spending in order to appease Wall Street's demands for fiscal restraint.

"We sincerely believe the volatility of the current operating environment requires financial discipline," Anadarko Chief Executive Al Walker told investors on Tuesday.

"Pursuing growth without adequate returns is something we will avoid."

The cuts partly seem designed to appease Wall Street's fixation on cash flow, even though some companies have strong balance sheets. Shares of Conoco rose 1.6 percent on Thursday, with shares of Anadarko up 1.5 percent.

Hess, for instance, cut $100 million from its 2017 spending plans despite having $2.5 billion in cash stored away. Anadarko cut $300 million, but has more than $6 billion in the bank.

"In the current low price environment, we continue our efforts to reduce both capital and operating costs," Hess Chief Executive John Hess told investors on Wednesday.

The cuts also came without plans to cut back on the number of rigs drilling into U.S. shale formations.

Increasing rig efficiency has meant U.S. shale producers can do more while spending less. In North Dakota, the No. 2 U.S. oil-producing state, Hess said it can now drill with four rigs the same number of wells that last year took six.

That improvement likely will continue to roil the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, who have tried to offset rising U.S. shale oil production with cuts of their own.

Shares of some oilfield service providers, which drill and frack wells for producers, have slipped as the capex decisions have been announced, with shares of Halliburton Co down more than 5.0 percent in the past week.

Amazon.com Inc is expected to report a rise in second-quarter revenue, helped by growth in its retail and cloud computing businesses. All eyes will be on any comments about Amazon's surprise $13.7 billion acquisition of specialty grocer Whole Foods Market, which has the potential to upend the already struggling U.S. retail industry. Investors and analysts will also focus on Amazon's current-quarter forecast, which will include its annual Prime Day sale; the company expanded its popular shopping festival to China, India and Mexico.

Data from the U.S. Commerce Department is likely to show that durable goods orders rose 3.0 percent in June after it fell 0.8 percent in May. Non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a proxy for business spending, are expected to have risen 0.3 percent after gaining 0.2 percent in the previous month. (0830/1330) The Commerce Department also issues its advance wholesale and retail inventories, excluding autos for June. (0830/1230) Separately, the Labor Department may report that initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose to 241,000 for the week ended July 22. Continued jobless claims are expected to fall to 1.950 million from 1.977 million the previous week. (0830/1330) The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City issues its composite and manufacturing outlook indices for July. (1100/1500) Additionally, building permits data for June are also expected to be released by the Census Bureau. (0830/1230)

Procter & Gamble Co reports fourth-quarter results. The Tide and Pampers maker is expected to report a 2-3 percent rise in fourth-quarter organic sales. The results come a week after activist investor Nelson Peltz sharply criticized the company, saying its stock price and sales are lagging peers due to its "suffocating bureaucracy". P&G, however, shot down Peltz's concerns, saying the company has taken several initiatives to boost its performance.

MasterCard Inc, the world's second-biggest payments processor, is expected to report a rise in second-quarter profit with higher cross-border volumes growth. However, costs are expected to rise due to the two acquisitions it made in the first quarter, VocaLink and NuData Security. Investors will also look for any update on the card company's progress to start operations in China.

Intel Corp, the world's largest chipmaker, is expected to report a rise in second-quarter revenue. However, the company said in April that it faced an unexpected slowdown in growth in its data center business, which has been a key contributor to Intel's growth. The company has also been banking on the business to reduce its reliance on the personal computer market.

Verizon Communications Inc reports second-quarter results. The No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier is expected to report its fifth straight quarter of revenue declines. The company, which has been facing stiff competition from smaller companies such as T-Mobile and Sprint, is likely to lose customers to other players in the market. New York Times Co reports second-quarter results. The newspaper publisher is expected to report a quarterly profit, compared with a loss a year earlier, as it benefits from higher digital subscriptions. The Times has been investing to beef up digital subscriptions amid restructuring initiatives and job cuts. It offered buyouts to some of its newsroom employees in May as it looks to streamline its editing and production systems.

Twitter Inc reports second-quarter results. The microblogging service is expected to report its second fall in revenue in its latest quarter since its debut. Chief Executive Jack Dorsey, whose leadership has been questioned amid stagnating user growth, is looking to shake things up for the company to cope with stiff competition from Facebook and Snapchat. However, Twitter reported better-than-expected growth in its monthly active users last quarter and any sign of that momentum continuing will be closely monitored as the company looks to woo users with a revamped interface and wider offerings.

Western Digital Corp reports fourth-quarter results. The data storage company is expected to report a rise in profit, helped by demand for its storage products. Western Digital is currently blocking the sale of Toshiba's flash memory business as it believes Toshiba needs its consent to sell the flash business.

Dow Chemical Co is expected to post a rise in second-quarter profit, buoyed by robust performance across its businesses. As the August date for the completion of its merger with DuPont nears, investors will be looking for further details on the structure of the new company, DowDupont, and its leadership.

Executives at Germany's largest lender, Deutsche Bank, have damped expectations for second-quarter earnings, even as results of its U.S. counterparts have exceeded expectations. Deutsche Bank is still burdened by deep restructuring and the uncertainty of Brexit. The European Central Bank is investigating the bank's two largest shareholders, Qatar's royal family and the Chinese conglomerate HNA. The bank is also getting roped into the investigation in Washington of possible collusion between President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign and Russia. Deutsche Bank is one of Trump's largest creditors.

Celgene Corp's second-quarter results are likely to be helped by sales of its blockbuster cancer drug, Revlimid, whose sales have slowed in the past few quarters. Investors will also look for more information on Celgene's licensing deal with China-based BeiGene Ltd as well as the clinical performance of treatments in the inflammatory bowel disease space, which has sparser competition.

Investors will likely focus on Boston Scientific Corp's heart device, Lotus valve system's performance in comparison to Medtronic Plc's CoreValve TAVI system, as the company reports second-quarter results. Analysts expect the company to outperform its large-cap med device peers as the company's robust pipeline products will contribute meaningfully to revenues.

McKesson Corp's first-quarter results will likely be helped by a stable branded drug pricing environment and a modest recovery in generic prices. Investors will focus on the comments from the drug distributor about its executive pay practices amid pressure from Teamsters, which holds a substantial stake in the company.

U.S. independent oil producer ConocoPhillips is expected to post a smaller second-quarter loss, helped by higher realized prices for crude compared with a year earlier. Separately, Valero Energy Corp is expected to report a dip in its second-quarter profit, hurt by lower margins and weak gasoline prices.

National Oilwell Varco, the U.S. oilfield equipment provider, is expected to report a smaller second-quarter loss due to higher demand amid increased drilling activity.

Raytheon Co, the maker of Tomahawk missiles, is expected to report higher revenue for the second quarter. The company sees increased demand for its products, fueled by a pro-defense Trump administration and U.S. allies, who are grappling with geopolitical instability. Investors will look for an update on the company's 2017 financial forecast.

Mattel Inc reports second-quarter results. The world's largest toy maker is taking drastic steps such as a management shakeup, renewed focus on emerging markets like China, increased investment in digital first strategy amid receding sales in the past few quarters. The company had forecast its second-quarter and full-year sales to be up in low single digits. Investors will be looking forward to any updates about a new CFO being appointed.

Electronic Arts Inc reports first-quarter results. The videogame publisher is expected to report a rise in quarterly revenue, helped by digital downloads and sales of its games such as "Battlefield 1". EA has not released any major games in the period, so investors will instead be focused on guidance for its current quarter, where the company is expected to release its yearly round of sports games, including FIFA and Madden NFL.

Lazard Ltd, the financial advisory and asset management firm, is expected to report a rise in quarterly profit, helped by a pick-up in dealmaking activity. Worldwide M&A activity rose 2 percent in the first half of 2017. Deal activity slowed in the year-ago quarter, when uncertainty from Brexit and volatile oil prices kept investors and companies on the sidelines.

Meat processor Maple Leaf Foods Inc reports second-quarter results. Of interest are any hints about how the company will deploy capital, now that it has returned to profit following a modernization program of its plants.

Canada's Potash Corp of Saskatchewan, the biggest global fertilizer producer by capacity, reports second-quarter results that are expected to include higher earnings. The focus is likely to be on issues around its merger with Agrium Inc, expected to close in the third quarter, creating a new company called Nutrien. Investors will be interested to hear of any hints about the new company's strategy.

Cameco Corp, the world's second-biggest uranium producer, reports second-quarter results. Spot uranium prices are continuing a six-year slump, forcing producers to cut output and costs. Of interest is any progress from Cameco on resolving a dispute with buyer Tepco.

Light oil and gas producer Crescent Point Energy Corp reports results for the second quarter, when energy prices were lower than many players in the western Canadian oil patch had expected. Investors will be looking for any updates on the company's strategy and spending plans.

Brazil's statistics agency IBGE releases its index of prices measured at the producer level for June. Producer prices index fell 0.12 percent in May.

UPDATE 3-Exxon sues U.S. over fine levied for Russia deal under Tillerson - Reuters News

{{20170720T230108.805+0000}}UPDATE 3-Exxon sues U.S. over fine levied for Russia deal under Tillerson(Recasts, adds material from lawsuit)

By Yeganeh Torbati and Ernest Scheyder

WASHINGTON/HOUSTON, July 20 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp sued the U.S. government on Thursday, blasting as "unlawful" and "capricious" a $2 million fine levied against it for a three-year-old oil joint venture with Russia's Rosneft .

The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday morning slapped the world's largest publicly traded oil producer with the fine for "reckless disregard" of U.S. sanctions in dealings with Russia in 2014 when Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was Exxon's chief executive.

The lawsuit and the Treasury's unusually detailed statement on Exxon's conduct represented an extraordinary confrontation between a major American company and the U.S. government, made all the more striking because Exxon's former CEO is now in President Donald Trump's Cabinet.

Exxon took the government to court despite the fact that the fine, the maximum allowed, would have a minor impact on the company, which made $7.84 billion in profit last year.

The fine came after a U.S. review of deals Exxon signed with Rosneft, Russia's largest oil producer, weeks after Washington imposed sanctions on Moscow for annexing Ukraine's Crimea region.

Between May 14 and May 23, 2014, top U.S.-based Exxon executives signed eight documents with Igor Sechin, the head of state-run Rosneft, the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said in the statement on its website.

OFAC said Exxon had "demonstrated reckless disregard for U.S. sanctions requirements" by signing the deals with Sechin just weeks after the United States blacklisted him, OFAC said in the three-page statement. (For the statement, see: http://bit.ly/2vnvQf2)

The Treasury imposed sanctions on Sechin in April 2014 as part of measures to pressure Russia over its intervention in Ukraine, saying Sechin had shown "utter loyalty" to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The sanctions prohibit U.S. citizens or people in the United States from dealing with those on the blacklist, such as Sechin. Rosneft itself is subject to narrower U.S. sanctions that still allow Americans to deal with the company on some transactions.

Exxon said in a statement that OFAC's action was "fundamentally unfair," and sued the U.S. government in Texas in an effort to overturn the decision. The company is based in Irving, Texas.

In its 21-page complaint, Exxon argued that Sechin "was subject to sanctions only in his individual capacity" and that guidance from the Obama administration at the time made clear that the sanctions "applied only to the 'personal assets' of the sanctioned individuals and emphasized that the sanctions did not restrict business with the companies those individuals managed."

(For Exxon's complaint, see: http://exxonmobil.co/2uNRWdr)

TILLERSON NOT CONSULTED

Tillerson left Exxon late last year to become secretary of state after 10 years running the company. He is now responsible for U.S. foreign policy, which includes helping make sanctions decisions.

The State Department referred questions about the fine to Exxon and the Treasury. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters on Thursday that the agency was alerted to the fine on Wednesday.

A Treasury spokesman said OFAC engaged with Exxon's lawyers only, and "did not discuss this case with Secretary Tillerson."

Tillerson said in January that he would recuse himself from matters involving Exxon for one year after his December 2016 resignation, unless he is authorized to participate.

Though the State Department plays a major part in formulating sanctions policy, former U.S. officials and sanctions experts said it was unlikely the agency had a role in deciding the fine announced on Thursday, because it falls under OFAC's regulatory role.

The back-and-forth between the Treasury and Exxon over the 2014 dealings spanned both the Obama and Trump administrations, and started with a subpoena from OFAC to Exxon in July 2014, Exxon said in its complaint.

Exxon fully complied with guidance from Democratic former President Barack Obama's administration that ongoing oil and gas business activities with Rosneft were permitted, Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said in a statement.

The Treasury "is trying to retroactively enforce a new interpretation of an executive order" inconsistent with its prior guidance, Jeffers said. "OFAC's action is fundamentally unfair."

Exxon also cited a Treasury Department representative's comments in May 2014 that BP Plc Chief Executive Bob Dudley - an American citizen - could continue to participate in Rosneft board meetings so long as they related only to Rosneft's business.

In its statement explaining the fine, OFAC said that the Treasury Department representative's comments did not address Exxon's conduct. BP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Publicly available guidance on the Treasury's website at the time of Exxon's dealings with Sechin said Americans should ensure they do not enter into contracts signed by sanctioned individuals, OFAC said.

And by dealing with Sechin, the company "caused significant harm" to U.S. sanctions on Russia, the agency said.

Because Rosneft itself is not off-limits to Americans, another company executive could have signed the contract with no sanctions risk to Exxon, said David Mortlock, who was a State Department and White House sanctions official under Obama.

"You could have Sechin standing over the guy's shoulder," said Mortlock, now an attorney at Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP in Washington. "But the problem here is that it was signed by Sechin himself."

Exxon said that approach would have flown in the face of standard business practice.

"You don't ask your business partner to have someone else sign instead of the CEO," said Exxon spokesman Jeffers.

OPPOSITION TO SANCTIONS

Exxon has long opposed U.S. sanctions on Russia, saying they harm American business interests and actually help European rivals.

Tillerson said in 2014 that the company did not support sanctions because they are not effective "unless they are very well implemented."

Sanctions were a contentious topic at Tillerson's confirmation hearing last January. At the time, Republican and Democratic lawmakers were concerned that Trump, whose associates are now under investigation for their ties to Russia, would try to quickly lift U.S. sanctions on the country.

"When sanctions are imposed, they by their design are going to harm American business," Tillerson said during the hearing, in response to a question about his views on them.

He also said that Exxon "never directly lobbied against sanctions," a claim that was immediately challenged by senators who cited Exxon's own lobbying disclosure forms.

The case is Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Steve Munchin, et al, U.S. District Court, North District of Texas, No. 3:17-cv-1930.

CORRECTED-What to Watch in the Day Ahead - Thursday, July 27 - Reuters News

{{20170726T210454.233+0000}}CORRECTED-What to Watch in the Day Ahead - Thursday, July 27(Corrects ConocoPhillips item to say the company is expected to post a smaller quarterly loss, not a quarterly profit)

Amazon.com Inc is expected to report a rise in second-quarter revenue, helped by growth in its retail and cloud computing businesses. All eyes will be on any comments about Amazon's surprise $13.7 billion acquisition of specialty grocer Whole Foods Market, which has the potential to upend the already struggling U.S. retail industry. Investors and analysts will also focus on Amazon's current-quarter forecast, which will include its annual Prime Day sale; the company expanded its popular shopping festival to China, India and Mexico.

Data from the U.S. Commerce Department is likely to show that durable goods orders rose 3.0 percent in June after it fell 0.8 percent in May. Non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a proxy for business spending, are expected to have risen 0.3 percent after gaining 0.2 percent in the previous month. (0830/1330) The Commerce Department also issues its advance wholesale and retail inventories, excluding autos for June. (0830/1230) Separately, the Labor Department may report that initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose to 241,000 for the week ended July 22. Continued jobless claims are expected to fall to 1.950 million from 1.977 million the previous week. (0830/1330) The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City issues its composite and manufacturing outlook indices for July. (1100/1500) Additionally, building permits data for June are also expected to be released by the Census Bureau. (0830/1230)

Procter & Gamble Co reports fourth-quarter results. The Tide and Pampers maker is expected to report a 2-3 percent rise in fourth-quarter organic sales. The results come a week after activist investor Nelson Peltz sharply criticized the company, saying its stock price and sales are lagging peers due to its "suffocating bureaucracy". P&G, however, shot down Peltz's concerns, saying the company has taken several initiatives to boost its performance.

MasterCard Inc, the world's second-biggest payments processor, is expected to report a rise in second-quarter profit with higher cross-border volumes growth. However, costs are expected to rise due to the two acquisitions it made in the first quarter, VocaLink and NuData Security. Investors will also look for any update on the card company's progress to start operations in China.

Intel Corp, the world's largest chipmaker, is expected to report a rise in second-quarter revenue. However, the company said in April that it faced an unexpected slowdown in growth in its data center business, which has been a key contributor to Intel's growth. The company has also been banking on the business to reduce its reliance on the personal computer market.

Verizon Communications Inc reports second-quarter results. The No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier is expected to report its fifth straight quarter of revenue declines. The company, which has been facing stiff competition from smaller companies such as T-Mobile and Sprint, is likely to lose customers to other players in the market. New York Times Co reports second-quarter results. The newspaper publisher is expected to report a quarterly profit, compared with a loss a year earlier, as it benefits from higher digital subscriptions. The Times has been investing to beef up digital subscriptions amid restructuring initiatives and job cuts. It offered buyouts to some of its newsroom employees in May as it looks to streamline its editing and production systems.

Twitter Inc reports second-quarter results. The microblogging service is expected to report its second fall in revenue in its latest quarter since its debut. Chief Executive Jack Dorsey, whose leadership has been questioned amid stagnating user growth, is looking to shake things up for the company to cope with stiff competition from Facebook and Snapchat. However, Twitter reported better-than-expected growth in its monthly active users last quarter and any sign of that momentum continuing will be closely monitored as the company looks to woo users with a revamped interface and wider offerings.

Western Digital Corp reports fourth-quarter results. The data storage company is expected to report a rise in profit, helped by demand for its storage products. Western Digital is currently blocking the sale of Toshiba's flash memory business as it believes Toshiba needs its consent to sell the flash business.

Dow Chemical Co is expected to post a rise in second-quarter profit, buoyed by robust performance across its businesses. As the August date for the completion of its merger with DuPont nears, investors will be looking for further details on the structure of the new company, DowDupont, and its leadership.

Executives at Germany's largest lender, Deutsche Bank, have damped expectations for second-quarter earnings, even as results of its U.S. counterparts have exceeded expectations. Deutsche Bank is still burdened by deep restructuring and the uncertainty of Brexit. The European Central Bank is investigating the bank's two largest shareholders, Qatar's royal family and the Chinese conglomerate HNA. The bank is also getting roped into the investigation in Washington of possible collusion between President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign and Russia. Deutsche Bank is one of Trump's largest creditors.

Celgene Corp's second-quarter results are likely to be helped by sales of its blockbuster cancer drug, Revlimid, whose sales have slowed in the past few quarters. Investors will also look for more information on Celgene's licensing deal with China-based BeiGene Ltd as well as the clinical performance of treatments in the inflammatory bowel disease space, which has sparser competition.

Investors will likely focus on Boston Scientific Corp's heart device, Lotus valve system's performance in comparison to Medtronic Plc's CoreValve TAVI system, as the company reports second-quarter results. Analysts expect the company to outperform its large-cap med device peers as the company's robust pipeline products will contribute meaningfully to revenues.

McKesson Corp's first-quarter results will likely be helped by a stable branded drug pricing environment and a modest recovery in generic prices. Investors will focus on the comments from the drug distributor about its executive pay practices amid pressure from Teamsters, which holds a substantial stake in the company.

U.S. independent oil producer ConocoPhillips is expected to post a smaller second-quarter loss, helped by higher realized prices for crude compared with a year earlier. Separately, Valero Energy Corp is expected to report a dip in its second-quarter profit, hurt by lower margins and weak gasoline prices.

National Oilwell Varco, the U.S. oilfield equipment provider, is expected to report a smaller second-quarter loss due to higher demand amid increased drilling activity.

Raytheon Co, the maker of Tomahawk missiles, is expected to report higher revenue for the second quarter. The company sees increased demand for its products, fueled by a pro-defense Trump administration and U.S. allies, who are grappling with geopolitical instability. Investors will look for an update on the company's 2017 financial forecast.

Mattel Inc reports second-quarter results. The world's largest toy maker is taking drastic steps such as a management shakeup, renewed focus on emerging markets like China, increased investment in digital first strategy amid receding sales in the past few quarters. The company had forecast its second-quarter and full-year sales to be up in low single digits. Investors will be looking forward to any updates about a new CFO being appointed.

Electronic Arts Inc reports first-quarter results. The videogame publisher is expected to report a rise in quarterly revenue, helped by digital downloads and sales of its games such as "Battlefield 1". EA has not released any major games in the period, so investors will instead be focused on guidance for its current quarter, where the company is expected to release its yearly round of sports games, including FIFA and Madden NFL.

Lazard Ltd, the financial advisory and asset management firm, is expected to report a rise in quarterly profit, helped by a pick-up in dealmaking activity. Worldwide M&A activity rose 2 percent in the first half of 2017. Deal activity slowed in the year-ago quarter, when uncertainty from Brexit and volatile oil prices kept investors and companies on the sidelines.

Meat processor Maple Leaf Foods Inc reports second-quarter results. Of interest are any hints about how the company will deploy capital, now that it has returned to profit following a modernization program of its plants.

Canada's Potash Corp of Saskatchewan, the biggest global fertilizer producer by capacity, reports second-quarter results that are expected to include higher earnings. The focus is likely to be on issues around its merger with Agrium Inc, expected to close in the third quarter, creating a new company called Nutrien. Investors will be interested to hear of any hints about the new company's strategy.

Cameco Corp, the world's second-biggest uranium producer, reports second-quarter results. Spot uranium prices are continuing a six-year slump, forcing producers to cut output and costs. Of interest is any progress from Cameco on resolving a dispute with buyer Tepco.

Light oil and gas producer Crescent Point Energy Corp reports results for the second quarter, when energy prices were lower than many players in the western Canadian oil patch had expected. Investors will be looking for any updates on the company's strategy and spending plans.

Brazil's statistics agency IBGE releases its index of prices measured at the producer level for June. Producer prices index fell 0.12 percent in May. (0900/1300) Mexico's seasonally adjusted trade balance data for June is expected. The country posted a $733 million trade deficit in May. (0900/1300)

UPDATE 3-Exxon sues U.S. over fine levied for Russia deal under Tillerson - Reuters News

{{20170720T230108.805+0000}}UPDATE 3-Exxon sues U.S. over fine levied for Russia deal under Tillerson(Recasts, adds material from lawsuit)

By Yeganeh Torbati and Ernest Scheyder

WASHINGTON/HOUSTON, July 20 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp sued the U.S. government on Thursday, blasting as "unlawful" and "capricious" a $2 million fine levied against it for a three-year-old oil joint venture with Russia's Rosneft .

The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday morning slapped the world's largest publicly traded oil producer with the fine for "reckless disregard" of U.S. sanctions in dealings with Russia in 2014 when Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was Exxon's chief executive.

The lawsuit and the Treasury's unusually detailed statement on Exxon's conduct represented an extraordinary confrontation between a major American company and the U.S. government, made all the more striking because Exxon's former CEO is now in President Donald Trump's Cabinet.

Exxon took the government to court despite the fact that the fine, the maximum allowed, would have a minor impact on the company, which made $7.84 billion in profit last year.

The fine came after a U.S. review of deals Exxon signed with Rosneft, Russia's largest oil producer, weeks after Washington imposed sanctions on Moscow for annexing Ukraine's Crimea region.

Between May 14 and May 23, 2014, top U.S.-based Exxon executives signed eight documents with Igor Sechin, the head of state-run Rosneft, the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said in the statement on its website.

OFAC said Exxon had "demonstrated reckless disregard for U.S. sanctions requirements" by signing the deals with Sechin just weeks after the United States blacklisted him, OFAC said in the three-page statement. (For the statement, see: http://bit.ly/2vnvQf2)

The Treasury imposed sanctions on Sechin in April 2014 as part of measures to pressure Russia over its intervention in Ukraine, saying Sechin had shown "utter loyalty" to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The sanctions prohibit U.S. citizens or people in the United States from dealing with those on the blacklist, such as Sechin. Rosneft itself is subject to narrower U.S. sanctions that still allow Americans to deal with the company on some transactions.

Exxon said in a statement that OFAC's action was "fundamentally unfair," and sued the U.S. government in Texas in an effort to overturn the decision. The company is based in Irving, Texas.

In its 21-page complaint, Exxon argued that Sechin "was subject to sanctions only in his individual capacity" and that guidance from the Obama administration at the time made clear that the sanctions "applied only to the 'personal assets' of the sanctioned individuals and emphasized that the sanctions did not restrict business with the companies those individuals managed."

(For Exxon's complaint, see: http://exxonmobil.co/2uNRWdr)

TILLERSON NOT CONSULTED

Tillerson left Exxon late last year to become secretary of state after 10 years running the company. He is now responsible for U.S. foreign policy, which includes helping make sanctions decisions.

The State Department referred questions about the fine to Exxon and the Treasury. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters on Thursday that the agency was alerted to the fine on Wednesday.

A Treasury spokesman said OFAC engaged with Exxon's lawyers only, and "did not discuss this case with Secretary Tillerson."

Tillerson said in January that he would recuse himself from matters involving Exxon for one year after his December 2016 resignation, unless he is authorized to participate.

Though the State Department plays a major part in formulating sanctions policy, former U.S. officials and sanctions experts said it was unlikely the agency had a role in deciding the fine announced on Thursday, because it falls under OFAC's regulatory role.

The back-and-forth between the Treasury and Exxon over the 2014 dealings spanned both the Obama and Trump administrations, and started with a subpoena from OFAC to Exxon in July 2014, Exxon said in its complaint.

Exxon fully complied with guidance from Democratic former President Barack Obama's administration that ongoing oil and gas business activities with Rosneft were permitted, Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said in a statement.

The Treasury "is trying to retroactively enforce a new interpretation of an executive order" inconsistent with its prior guidance, Jeffers said. "OFAC's action is fundamentally unfair."

Exxon also cited a Treasury Department representative's comments in May 2014 that BP Plc Chief Executive Bob Dudley - an American citizen - could continue to participate in Rosneft board meetings so long as they related only to Rosneft's business.

In its statement explaining the fine, OFAC said that the Treasury Department representative's comments did not address Exxon's conduct. BP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Publicly available guidance on the Treasury's website at the time of Exxon's dealings with Sechin said Americans should ensure they do not enter into contracts signed by sanctioned individuals, OFAC said.

And by dealing with Sechin, the company "caused significant harm" to U.S. sanctions on Russia, the agency said.

Because Rosneft itself is not off-limits to Americans, another company executive could have signed the contract with no sanctions risk to Exxon, said David Mortlock, who was a State Department and White House sanctions official under Obama.

"You could have Sechin standing over the guy's shoulder," said Mortlock, now an attorney at Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP in Washington. "But the problem here is that it was signed by Sechin himself."

Exxon said that approach would have flown in the face of standard business practice.

"You don't ask your business partner to have someone else sign instead of the CEO," said Exxon spokesman Jeffers.

OPPOSITION TO SANCTIONS

Exxon has long opposed U.S. sanctions on Russia, saying they harm American business interests and actually help European rivals.

Tillerson said in 2014 that the company did not support sanctions because they are not effective "unless they are very well implemented."

Sanctions were a contentious topic at Tillerson's confirmation hearing last January. At the time, Republican and Democratic lawmakers were concerned that Trump, whose associates are now under investigation for their ties to Russia, would try to quickly lift U.S. sanctions on the country.

"When sanctions are imposed, they by their design are going to harm American business," Tillerson said during the hearing, in response to a question about his views on them.

He also said that Exxon "never directly lobbied against sanctions," a claim that was immediately challenged by senators who cited Exxon's own lobbying disclosure forms.

The case is Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Steve Munchin, et al, U.S. District Court, North District of Texas, No. 3:17-cv-1930.

JPMorgan tops Canadian M&A activity in energy-driven first half - 路透新闻

{{20170706T145934.582+0000}}JPMorgan tops Canadian M&A activity in energy-driven first halfBy John Tilak

TORONTO, July 6 (Reuters) - Canadian mergers and acquisitions rose about 13 percent to C$120.5 billion ($93.2 billion) in the first half of 2017, driven by big-ticket energy deals and robust cross-border activity, according to Thomson Reuters data released on Thursday.

Despite strong initial public offerings, overall equity capital deals fell 12 percent to C$26.9 billion in the first half from a year ago, the data showed.

JPMorgan , Toronto-Dominion Bank and Goldman Sachs took the top three spots in the M&A league tables rankings, while Royal Bank of Canada , TD and Bank of Montreal were the top three advisers on Canadian equity issues in the first half of 2017.

Canadian companies and pension funds have been seeking investment opportunities outside of Canada, and that is expected to keep M&A bankers busy in the second half.

"We see the financial buyers - the pension plans, asset managers - continually active outside of Canada," said David Rawlings, head of JPMorgan Canada.

The two biggest energy deals of the year so far were Cenovus Energy Inc's roughly C$16.8 billion acquisition of ConocoPhillips' oil sands and natural gas assets and Royal Dutch Shell's sale of most of its Canadian oil sands assets for $8.5 billion.

"The large international majors are looking to delever their balance sheet and sell non-core assets," said Peter Buzzi, co-head of Canadian M&A at RBC. "And for many of them, it appears Canada falls into that non-core category," he added.

Canadian IPOs, which have been rebounding after a quiet 2016, rose to C$3.4 billion, the best first half in 11 years.

"The IPO pipeline looks strong," said Benoit Lauzé, head of equity capital markets at CIBC. "There would be very significant appetite for good technology names," he added.

Kinder Morgan Canada's C$1.75 billion IPO and Canada Goose Holdings Inc's offering were some of the highlights in the first half.

But overall, the equity capital activity in the energy sector could slow because of choppiness in oil prices, bankers said.

"Investors have been generally taking a risk-off approach and we're seeing limited conviction that oil prices are going to be high in the near term," said Kirby Gavelin, head of equity capital markets at RBC. ($1 = 1.2923 Canadian dollars)

FACTBOX-Oil majors' investments in countries involved in Qatar row - 路透新闻

{{20170705T171954.500+0000}}FACTBOX-Oil majors' investments in countries involved in Qatar rowDUBAI, July 5 (Reuters) - The West's three biggest energy corporations are lobbying Qatar to take part in a huge expansion of its gas production, handing Doha an unintended but timely boost in its bitter dispute with Gulf Arab neighbours. [nL8N1JW2PB]

ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell and Total already have large investments in countries on both sides of the dispute, and are keen not to take sides after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Doha on June 5.

Here are some facts about international oil companies which operate in the Gulf countries involved in the rift:

EXXONMOBIL

** Qatar

The U.S. oil major's relationship with Qatar goes back to 1935 when it was known as Socony-Vacuum, and later Mobil.

It helped to develop the North Field, the world's biggest gas field, and supplied Qatar with technology to make it the top competitor in the LNG market.

Qatar's LNG production is divided between two companies, Qatargas and Rasgas. State oil company Qatar Petroleum (QP) owns a majority stake in both.

RasGas is 70 percent-owned by QP and 30 percent-owned by ExxonMobil, while Qatargas is owned by a consortium including QP, ExxonMobil, Total, Mitsui <8031.T>, Marubeni <8002.T>, ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell.

ExxonMobil is also the only foreign participant in two domestic gas projects, Al-Khaleej Gas and Barzan Gas.

** Saudi Arabia

ExxonMobil is one of the largest foreign investors in Saudi Arabia, with more than 3,000 Saudi nationals working in the joint ventures in which the U.S. oil major participates. These range from petrochemicals manufacturing to petroleum refining.

The company began working with Saudi Arabia in 1927 and owned a stake in the state oil giant Saudi Aramco before it was fully nationalised in the 1980s.

ExxonMobil has been a partner with Aramco in several major projects over the years including building the East-West Pipeline (Petroline) linking the Eastern Province fields with Yanbu on the Red Sea and the SAMREF refinery in Yanbu, which is equally-owned by Aramco and a subsidiary of Exxon.

It is also a partner with SABIC in two petrochemical joint ventures - Saudi Yanbu Petrochemical Company (YANPET), and Al-Jubail Petrochemical Company (KEMYA).

** The UAE

ExxonMobil was awarded the first oil concession in Abu Dhabi, now the capital of the UAE, in 1939.

Exxon is now developing the Upper Zakum offshore oilfield through a joint venture, Zakum Development Company (ZADCO), with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company. ADNOC has a 60 percent stake, while Exxon owns 28 percent and Japan's Jodco 12 percent.

The U.S. company also markets lubricants and petrochemicals for the Middle East and North Africa region out of its office in Dubai.

TOTAL

** Qatar

The French oil major has been working with Qatar since 1936 through cooperation with Qatar Petroleum in developing LNG, refining and petrochemicals projects.

Total is one of the main partners of Qatargas, the world's largest LNG producer, owning stakes in Qatargas 1 and Qatargas 2. It is a main shareholder in the Dolphin Energy pipeline which transfers natural gas from Qatar to the UAE and Oman.

It has joint ventures with Qatar Petroleum to develop the Al-Khalij and Al-Shaheen oil fields. Total Refining & Petrochemicals has stakes in both Qatar Petrochemicals Company (QAPCO), operating a petrochemical complex manufacturing ethylene and low-density polyethylene, and QATOFIN. Total is a partner in the Ras Laffan refinery and also sells lubricants.

** Saudi Arabia

Total has been present in Saudi Arabia for almost 40 years and is a main player in the downstream sector. The French company has a 51 percent stake in the Saudi Total Petroleum Products joint venture, which manufactures and retails lubricants and specialty products.

It owns a 37.5 percent stake in the SATORP joint ventre - a 400,000 barrels per day refining and petrochemicals complex in Jubail - with Saudi Aramco owning the remaining 62.5 percent.

** The UAE

Since 1939, Total has been working with the majority of Abu Dhabi's oil and gas operating companies and other energy firms: ADCO, ADMA-OPCO, ADGAS, GASCO, FERTIL, Taweelah A1, Shams 1 and Dolphin Energy.

It has a 10 percent stake in a 40-year onshore concession to help develop Abu Dhabi's biggest oilfields.

** Iran

Total signed a 20-year contract with Iran this week to develop the giant South Pars gas field, which it shares with Qatar. The deal is the first major Western energy investment since sanctions against Tehran were lifted.

Total will be the operator with a 50.1 percent stake in South Pars. The first stage will cost around $2 billion.

SHELL

** Qatar

Shell said it is the biggest international investor in Qatar, surpassing Exxon. It is in partnership with Qatar Petroleum in projects covering LNG production, gas to liquids (GTL), shipping, exploration and petrochemicals.

One of Shell's main investments in Qatar is Pearl Gas-to-Liquids in Ras Laffan, the largest GTL plant in the world.

The company also own a 30 percent stake in Qatargas 4, an integrated LNG production facility together with Qatar Petroleum, and is the shipping and maritime services provider for QatarGas Transport Company (Nakilat).

** Saudi Arabia

Shell has a diverse business with Saudi Arabia. It has a stake in SASREF, a 50:50 joint venture refinery at Jubail with a crude oil refining capacity of 305,000 bpd, and a partnership with SABIC through its SADAF joint venture.

It also has a joint venture that markets and sells Shell lubricants, and another that handles aviation re-fueling operations in the kingdom.

** The UAE

Shell currently does not own a direct stake in UAE's oil or gas fields as talks with ADNOC to renew its 40-year oil concession stalled. However, the company has its regional headquarters in Dubai, through which it manages its businesses in the Middle East.

** Other foreign companies such as Occidental have operations in both Qatar and the UAE, while ConocoPhillips also owns interests in Qatar and Saudi Arabia.

** Trading houses including the world's biggest names such as Vitol, Trafigura and Glencore also have business interests with all the countries locked in the political crisis.

** Asian countries such as China, India, South Korea and Japan are major buyers of crude, condensate and LNG from the Middle East producers.

WRAPUP 4-Qatar shows mettle, offers compromise as Gulf states prepare meeting - 路透新闻

* Doha plans 30 pct hike in LNG capacity

* Four Arab states to announce reaction on Weds

* Rift raises concern about energy supplies

(Adds background on LNG)

By Tom Finn and Rania El Gamal

DOHA, July 4 (Reuters) - Qatar announced plans for a steep rise in Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) production capacity on Tuesday that suggested it was ready for a protracted dispute with Gulf neighbours, but Doha said it was doing all it could to reach agreement.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain were due to meet on Wednesday to decide whether to continue sanctions they imposed on Qatar on accusations it was aiding terrorism and courting regional rival Iran. Doha denies the charges and has submitted to mediator Kuwait replies to 13 demands that the gathering will consider.

"What Qatar has given in goodwill and good initiative for a constructive solution, based on dialogue, we believe should be sufficient (to show) we have carried out our duties from our side," Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told a news conference in Doha.

"There is a lot of progress that has been made on that front (countering terrorism financing)... but of course there is always room for improvement," he said, describing the sanctions as illegal steps under the pretext of fighting terrorism.

The three Gulf states and Egypt have severed diplomatic and transport ties with Doha in a dispute that has raised concern across the Middle East and beyond. Western states fear a lengthy dispute, besides threatening political instability, could upset supply chains in a region vital for energy supplies.

German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told the same Doha news conference he felt Qatar had shown restraint in the row which began on June 5 when the Gulf states severed diplomatic and transport ties.

"We hope others will respond in a similar spirit.

Qatar says it is ready to meet any "reasonable" demands.

But the Gulf state, with a population of just over two million to Saudi Arabia's 31 million, may be reluctant to carry out conditions such as the closure of the al-Jazeera television station and removal of a Turkish military base - matters it considers impinge on Qatari sovereignty.

Qatar mounted what appeared to be a show of strength on Tuesday, when the state-owned Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL] announced plans to raise liquefied natural gas capacity by 30 percent. Its immediate effect will be to worsen a glut on the LNG market where Australia, the United States and Russia vie.

LNG is natural gas liquified at low temperatures to reduce its volume, thus allowing it to be transported by tanker where pipelines are not feasible.

Qatar Petroleum chief executive Saad al-Kaabi said the firm would increase gas production from its giant North Field, which it shares with Iran, by 20 percent after new gas development. In April, Qatar lifted a self-imposed ban on development of the North Field, the world's biggest natural gas field, and announced a new project to develop its southern section, increasing output in five to seven years. [nL5N1HB1RQ]

That new project will raise Qatar's total LNG production capacity by 30 percent to 100 million tonnes from 77 million tonnes per year in five to seven years, Kaabi said.

The decision will have international ramifications.

With such low production costs and LNG facilities closer to buyers in Europe and Asia, the Qatari move means U.S. producers could struggle to sell their LNG competitively and projects still needing finance could struggle to find investors. So far only Cheniere exports U.S. LNG, but there are project proposals with a total capacity of some 150 million tonnes/year.

Energy sales have driven Qatar's rapid rise as a regional player, with vast infrastructure projects and widening diplomatic influence as well as a role in the Syrian conflict that is viewed with suspicion by Gulf neighbours.

The Saudi Ambassador to Sudan Ali Hassan Jaafar, speaking at a news conference, said he hoped the Gulf crisis would end "in the coming hours" with the Qatari response to demands.

"We wish well for the people of Qatar and we hope that the rulers of Qatar return to their senses," he said. "We want stability in the Gulf region and in the Arab region. … If these demands are not fulfilled we will defend our security and stability and there will be other measures."

IRANIAN QUESTION

The LNG glut has already driven down prices. Asian spot LNG prices LNG-AS have fallen more than 40 percent this year to $5.50 per mmBtu and by 70 percent from peaks in 2014.

So far, the majority of LNG is supplied via long-term contracts between producers and users which allow little flexibility and in many cases also prevent importers from reselling cargoes. With supplies far outpacing demand, analysts expect more and more LNG to be freely traded.

Many producers have already started to offer contracts without resale or destination restrictions. [nL3N1J9338]

Kaabi, alluding to suggestions that the Gulf states may ask trading partners to choose between them and Doha, said the company's operations would not be affected by the crisis.

"Qatar Petroleum will continue working...If some companies decide they don't want to work with QP that's their choice. We will find other foreign companies to work with," he said.

Analysts said the move to boost production was partly to do with added competition in the LNG market, mainly from Australia, the United States and Russia.

"It is also to do with Iran now set to increase production on the South Pars field, which means they can up production from their side of the field (North Field) without destabilizing the geology of the field," said Oliver Sanderson, gas analyst at Thomson Reuters.

Some experts say that, while the Gulf States accuse Qatar of cooperating too closely with Iran, their sanctions could push it to closer cooperation with Tehran on gas production and exports from the shared field.

"Qatar needs the support of Iran now more than any time before. I don't believe it would be possible for Qatar to increase production without the cooperation with Iran, if in the long term the (political) situation stayed same as now," said Reza Mostafavi Tabatabaei, president of London-based ENEXD, a firm involved in oil and gas equipment in the Middle East.

"Also, major (oil) companies may be asked to choose between working in Qatar or Saudi/UAE and Egypt, otherwise there be sanctions against them. That's why I don't think that developing this project by Qatar now will be as easy as before, politically not financially," he added.

Qatar Petroleum's Kaabi said there is no cooperation with Iran on any project in the North Field, but the countries have a joint committee that meets yearly to discuss development of the field.

While QP owns a majority stake, energy firms including Total, Mitsui & Co <8031.T> and ConocoPhillips also possess small stakeholdings. RasGas is a 70/30 percent joint venture between QP and Exxon Mobil .

"Qatar has one of the lowest LNG production costs in the world. It has followed an astute policy of maximizing value from market prices around the world," said Ajay Singh, special advisor at Japan Petroleum Exploration Co and former gas executive at Shell. "For Qatar, LNG is everything."

By Tom Finn and Rania El Gamal

DOHA, July 4 (Reuters) - Qatar announced plans for a steep rise in Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) production capacity on Tuesday that suggested it was ready for a protracted dispute with Gulf neighbours, but Doha said it was doing all it could to reach agreement.

Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain were due to meet on Wednesday to decide whether to continue sanctions they imposed on Qatar on accusations it was aiding terrorism and courting regional rival Iran. Doha denies the charges and has submitted to mediator Kuwait replies to 13 demands that the gathering will consider.

"What Qatar has given in goodwill and good initiative for a constructive solution, based on dialogue, we believe should be sufficient (to show) we have carried out our duties from our side," Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani told a news conference in Doha.

"There is a lot of progress that has been made on that front (countering terrorism financing)... but of course there is always room for improvement," he said, describing the sanctions as illegal steps under the pretext of fighting terrorism.

The three Gulf states and Egypt have severed diplomatic and transport ties with Doha in a dispute that has raised concern across the Middle East and beyond. Western states fear a lengthy dispute, besides threatening political instability, could upset supply chains in a region vital for energy supplies.

German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told the same Doha news conference he felt Qatar had shown restraint in the row which began on June 5 when the Gulf states severed diplomatic and transport ties.

"We hope others will respond in a similar spirit.

Qatar says it is ready to meet any "reasonable" demands.

But the Gulf state, with a population of just over two million to Saudi Arabia's 31 million, may be reluctant to carry out conditions such as the closure of the al-Jazeera television station and removal of a Turkish military base - matters it considers impinge on Qatari sovereignty.

Qatar mounted what appeared to be a show of strength on Tuesday, when the state-owned Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL] announced plans to raise liquefied natural gas capacity by 30 percent. Its immediate effect will be to worsen a glut on the LNG market where Australia, the United States and Russia vie.

Qatar Petroleum chief executive Saad al-Kaabi said the firm would increase gas production from its giant North Field, which it shares with Iran, by 20 percent after new gas development. In April, Qatar lifted a self-imposed ban on development of the North Field, the world's biggest natural gas field, and announced a new project to develop its southern section, increasing output in five to seven years. [nL5N1HB1RQ]

That new project will raise Qatar's total LNG production capacity by 30 percent to 100 million tonnes from 77 million tonnes per year, Kaabi said.

The decision will have international ramifications.

With such low production costs and LNG facilities closer to buyers in Europe and Asia, the Qatari move means U.S. producers could struggle to sell their LNG competitively and projects still needing finance could struggle to find investors. So far only Cheniere exports U.S. LNG, but there are project proposals with a total capacity of some 150 million tonnes/year.

Energy sales have driven Qatar's rapid rise as a regional player, with vast infrastructure projects and widening diplomatic influence as well as a role in the Syrian conflict that is viewed with suspicion by Gulf neighbours.

The Saudi Ambassador to Sudan Ali Hassan Jaafar, speaking at a news conference, said he hoped the Gulf crisis would end "in the coming hours" with the Qatari response to demands.

"We wish well for the people of Qatar and we hope that the rulers of Qatar return to their senses," he said. "We want stability in the Gulf region and in the Arab region. … If these demands are not fulfilled we will defend our security and stability and there will be other measures."

IRANIAN QUESTION

The LNG glut has already driven down prices. Asian spot LNG prices LNG-AS have fallen more than 40 percent this year to $5.50 per mmBtu and by 70 percent from peaks in 2014.

So far, the majority of LNG is supplied via long-term contracts between producers and users which allow little flexibility and in many cases also prevent importers from reselling cargoes. With supplies far outpacing demand, analysts expect more and more LNG to be freely traded.

Many producers have already started to offer contracts without resale or destination restrictions. [nL3N1J9338]

Kaabi, alluding to suggestions that the Gulf states may ask trading partners to choose between them and Doha, said the company's operations would not be affected by the crisis.

"Qatar Petroleum will continue working...If some companies decide they don't want to work with QP that's their choice. We will find other foreign companies to work with," he said.

Analysts said the move to boost production was partly to do with added competition in the LNG market, mainly from Australia, the United States and Russia.

"It is also to do with Iran now set to increase production on the South Pars field, which means they can up production from their side of the field (North Field) without destabilizing the geology of the field," said Oliver Sanderson, gas analyst at Thomson Reuters.

Some experts say that, while the Gulf States accuse Qatar of cooperating too closely with Iran, their sanctions could push it to closer cooperation with Tehran on gas production and exports from the shared field.

"Qatar needs the support of Iran now more than any time before. I don't believe it would be possible for Qatar to increase production without the cooperation with Iran, if in the long term the (political) situation stayed same as now," said Reza Mostafavi Tabatabaei, president of London-based ENEXD, a firm involved in oil and gas equipment in the Middle East.

"Also, major (oil) companies may be asked to choose between working in Qatar or Saudi/UAE and Egypt, otherwise there be sanctions against them. That's why I don't think that developing this project by Qatar now will be as easy as before, politically not financially," he added.

Qatar Petroleum's Kaabi said there is no cooperation with Iran on any project in the North Field, but the countries have a joint committee that meets yearly to discuss development of the field.

While QP owns a majority stake, energy firms including Total, Mitsui & Co <8031.T> and ConocoPhillips also possess small stakeholdings. RasGas is a 70/30 percent joint venture between QP and Exxon Mobil .

"Qatar has one of the lowest LNG production costs in the world. It has followed an astute policy of maximizing value from market prices around the world," said Ajay Singh, special advisor at Japan Petroleum Exploration Co and former gas executive at Shell. "For Qatar, LNG is everything."

DOHA, July 4 (Reuters) - Qatar announced on Tuesday it planned to raise liquefied natural gas (LNG) capacity by 30 percent in an apparent show of strength in its dispute with Gulf neighbours who have imposed political and economic sanctions on Doha.

The unexpected move came as Qatar appears to be preparing itself for greater economic independence should the dispute with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain become protracted. Its immediate effect will be to worsen a glut on the LNG market where Australia, the United States and Russia vie.

The Gulf states and Egypt have severed diplomatic and transport ties with Doha, accusing it of supporting terrorism and courting regional rival Iran. Qatar denies the accusation.

The Arab states, who have presented Doha with a list of demands, meet on Wednesday to discuss how to end the crisis; or they could impose more sanctions, which may include asking trade partners to pick a side in the rift.

Qatar Petroleum's [QATPE.UL] chief executive said the firm would increase gas production from its giant North Field, which it shares with Iran, by 20 percent after new gas development. In April, Qatar lifted a self-imposed ban on development of the North Field, the world's biggest natural gas field, and announced a new project to develop its southern section, increasing output in five to seven years.

That new project will raise Qatar's total LNG production capacity by 30 percent to 100 million tonnes from 77 million tonnes per year, CEO Saad al-Kaabi told a news conference.

"Once completed...this project will raise the production of the State of Qatar to about 6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day," Kaabi said.

With such low production costs and LNG facilities closer to buyers in Europe and Asia, the Qatari move means U.S. producers could struggle to sell their LNG competitively and projects still needing finance could struggle to find investors.

Kaabi said the company's operations would not be affected by the diplomatic crisis or sanctions.

"Qatar Petroleum will continue working...If some companies decide they don't want to work with QP that's their choice. We will find other foreign companies to work with," he said.

Analysts said the move to boost production was partly to do with added competition in the LNG market, mainly from Ausralia, the United States and Russia.

Qatar Petroleum's Kaabi said there is no cooperation with Iran on any project in the North Field, but the countries have a joint committee that meets every year to discuss development of the field.

He added that the company will be looking for international partners, declining to say when a tender would be issued.

Qatargas, the largest LNG-producing company in the world, and RasGas also operate projects on the North Field.

While QP owns a majority stake, energy firms including Total, Mitsui & Co <8031.T> and ConocoPhillips also possess small stakeholdings. RasGas is a 70/30 percent joint venture between QP and Exxon Mobil .

"Qatar has one of the lowest LNG production costs in the world. It has followed an astute policy of maximizing value from market prices around the world," said Ajay Singh, special advisor at Japan Petroleum Exploration Co and former gas executive at Shell. "For Qatar, LNG is everything."

UPDATE 3-U.S. warns businesses of hacking campaign against nuclear, energy firms - 路透新闻

{{20170701T032855.821+0000}}UPDATE 3-U.S. warns businesses of hacking campaign against nuclear, energy firms(Adds comments from nuclear power generators)

By Jim Finkle

TORONTO, June 30 (Reuters) - The U.S government warned industrial firms this week about a hacking campaign targeting the nuclear and energy sectors, the latest event to highlight the power industry's vulnerability to cyber attacks.

Since at least May, hackers used tainted "phishing" emails to "harvest credentials" so they could gain access to networks of their targets, according to a joint report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The report provided to the industrial firms was reviewed by Reuters on Friday. While disclosing attacks, and warning that in some cases hackers succeeded in compromising the networks of their targets, it did not identify any specific victims.

"Historically, cyber actors have strategically targeted the energy sector with various goals ranging from cyber espionage to the ability to disrupt energy systems in the event of a hostile conflict," the report said.

Homeland Security and FBI officials could not be reached for comment on the report, which was dated June 28.

The report was released during a week of heavy hacking activity.

A virus dubbed "NotPetya" attacked on Tuesday, spreading from initial infections in Ukraine to businesses around the globe. It encrypted data on infected machines, rendering them inoperable and disrupting activity at ports, law firms and factories. [L8N1JP55N]

On Tuesday the energy-industry news site E&E News reported that U.S. investigators were looking into cyber intrusions this year at multiple nuclear power generators.

Reuters has not confirmed details of the E&E News report, which said there was no evidence safety systems had been compromised at affected plants.

The activity described in the U.S. government report comes at a time when industrial firms are particularly anxious about threat that hackers pose to their operations.

Industrial firms, including power providers and other utilities, have been particularly worried about the potential for destructive cyber attacks since December 2016, when hackers cut electricity in Ukraine.

U.S. nuclear power generators PSEG , SCANA Corp and Entergy Corp said they were not impacted by the recent cyber attacks. SCANA's V.C. Summer nuclear plant in South Carolina shut down on Thursday due to a problem with a valve in the non-nuclear portion of the plant, a spokesman said.

Another nuclear power generator, Dominion Energy , said it does not comment on cyber security.

Two cyber security firms said on June 12 that they had identified the malicious software used in the Ukraine attack, which they dubbed Industroyer, warning that it could be easily modified to attack utilities in the United States and Europe. [L1N1J90J8]

Industroyer is only the second piece of malware uncovered to date that is capable of disrupting industrial processes without the need for hackers to manually intervene.

The first, Stuxnet, was discovered in 2010 and is widely believed by security researchers to have been used by the United States and Israel to attack Iran's nuclear program.

The U.S. government report said attackers conducted reconnaissance to gain information about the individuals whose computers they sought to infect so that they create "decoy documents" on topics of interest to their targets.

In an analysis, it described 11 files used in the attacks, including malware downloaders and tools that allow the hackers to take remote control of victim's computers and travel across their networks.

Chevron Corp , Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips , the three largest U.S. oil producers, declined to comment on their network security.
