Cenovus C$3 billion offering has been fully subscribed - sources - 路透新闻

{{20170331T232705.229+0000}}Cenovus C$3 billion offering has been fully subscribed - sourcesTORONTO, March 31 (Reuters) - Cenovus Energy Inc's C$3 billion ($2.25 billion) equity offering to partly fund its planned C$17.7 billion acquisition of some of ConocoPhillips Co's Canadian assets has been fully subscribed, sources familiar with the situation said on Friday.

The sale of 187.5 million common shares at C$16 per share was fully allocated on Wednesday evening, soon after the deal was announced, the people said. The people declined to be named because the matter was not public.

The equity sale is expected to close next week.

Royal Bank of Canada and JPMorgan Chase & Co , which are leading the share sale, did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside office hours on Friday. A Cenovus spokesman declined to comment.

Cenovus shares tumbled to their biggest one-day percentage drop in history on Thursday as investors wondered if the company had made the right move in reaching the cash and stock deal to buy ConocoPhillips' oil sands and natural gas assets. The stock was unchanged on Friday. [nL2N1H7108] ($1 = 1.3320 Canadian dollars)

UPDATE 4-ConocoPhillips sells oil and gas assets to Cenovus for $13.3 bln - Reuters News

{{20170330T002607.773+0000}}UPDATE 4-ConocoPhillips sells oil and gas assets to Cenovus for $13.3 bln(Adds detail on Cenovus stock)

By Nia Williams and Ethan Lou

CALGARY, Alberta, March 29 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips on Wednesday agreed to sell oil sands and western Canadian natural gas assets to Cenovus Energy Inc for C$17.7 billion ($13.3 billion), making it the latest international oil major to pull back from a region where high costs and low crude prices have made it hard for large companies to make an acceptable return.

For Calgary-based Cenovus, among Canada's largest producers, the deal doubles its production to 588,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day as it takes full ownership of its main oil sands assets in northern Alberta.

ConocoPhillips will sell its 50 percent interest in the Foster Creek Christina Lake oil sands partnership, which Cenovus already operates, as well as the majority of its western Canada Deep Basin conventional gas assets.

The U.S. oil major will retain its 50 percent interest in the Surmont oil sands project, a joint venture with Total E&P Canada , and its liquids-rich Blueberry-Montney shale assets.

The divestment, the largest in ConocoPhillips's history, was unexpected on Wall Street but comes as the company has come under pressure to cut its debt. Its shares jumped 6 percent in after-hours trading.

Shares of Cenovus listed on the New York Stock Exchange tumbled more than 8 percent after hours.

The deal, the fifth-biggest in the Canadian energy sector according to Thomson Reuters data, comes weeks after Royal Dutch Shell and Marathon Oil Corp sold off billions of dollars in oil sands assets and adds to uncertainty over future development in the patch.

Canada's oil sands hold the world's third-largest crude reserves but also carry some of the highest operating costs globally, and are struggling to compete with cheaper U.S. shale plays in a $50-a-barrel oil price environment. [nL2N1GM20K]

"Now that you have a prolonged period of low crude prices, the companies are really looking hard on where is the place to invest," Carlos Murillo, economist at the Conference Board of Canada. "Canadian companies ... they're kind of getting bigger in what they know ... whereas other companies are seeing opportunities elsewhere."

ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Ryan Lance said his company will use the cash portion of the deal to pay down debt and increase share repurchases.

The company last fall told analysts it would hive off $5 billion to $8 billion in assets this year. The Canadian divestment comes on top of that plan, boosting the planned asset sales for the year to more than $16 billion.

Calgary-based Cenovus will pay C$14.1 billion in cash and 208 million Cenovus common shares. It launched a bought-deal financing agreement to sell 187.5 million shares at C$16 each for expected gross proceeds of more than C$3 billion.

CEO Brian Ferguson said the company intends to divest a significant portion of legacy conventional assets to help fund the transaction.

"In a low oil-price environment, economies of scale are important. This deal about doubles the scale of the company, and this will give us a greater competitive edge," Ferguson said on a public conference call.

JPMorgan and Royal Bank of Canada advised Cenovus, the Canadian company said.

REFILE-INSIGHT-As Trump targets energy rules, oil companies downplay their impact - 路透新闻

{{20170328T212233.725+0000}}REFILE-INSIGHT-As Trump targets energy rules, oil companies downplay their impact(Refiles March 23 story to fix spelling of Renaissance in first subhead)

By Richard Valdmanis

BOSTON, March 23 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's White House has said his plans to slash environmental regulations will trigger a new energy boom and help the United States drill its way to independence from foreign oil.

But the top U.S. oil and gas companies have been telling their shareholders that regulations have little impact on their business, according to a Reuters review of U.S. securities filings from the top producers.

In annual reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 13 of the 15 biggest U.S. oil and gas producers said that compliance with current regulations is not impacting their operations or their financial condition.

The other two made no comment about whether their businesses were materially affected by regulation, but reported spending on compliance with environmental regulations at less than 3 percent of revenue.

The dissonance raises questions about whether Trump's war on regulation can increase domestic oil and gas output, as he has promised, or boost profits and share prices of oil and gas companies, as some investors have hoped.

According to the SEC, a publicly traded company must deem a matter "material" and report it to the agency if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important.

"Materiality is a fairly low bar," said Cary Coglianese, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who runs the university's research program on regulation. "Despite exaggerated claims, regulatory costs are usually a very small portion of many companies' cost of doing business."

The oil majors' annual filings come after the industry and its political allies have spent years criticizing the Obama administration for policies aimed at reducing fossil-fuel consumption, curtailing drilling on federal lands and subsidizing renewable energy.

Trump promised during the campaign that a rollback of the Democratic administration's policies would help free the nation from reliance on imported oil.

"Under my presidency, we will accomplish complete American energy independence," said Trump, describing regulation as a "self-inflicted wound."

The Trump administration is now preparing an executive order - dubbed the "Energy Independence" executive order - to roll back Obama-era regulations, which could be signed as early as this month, according to administration officials.

U.S. presidents have aimed to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, which triggered soaring prices. But the United States still imports about 7.9 million barrels of crude oil a day - almost enough meet total oil demand in Japan and India combined.

"ENERGY RENAISSANCE"

The Trump administration's attacks on regulation have been applauded by the oil industry.

"We haven't seen 3 percent growth in the economy for eight years, and I think part of the reason is that we've had a heavy dose of regulation," Chevron Corp. CEO John Watson said at CERAWeek, a global energy conference in Houston this month.

Continental Resources CEO, Harold Hamm, who advised Trump on energy issues during his campaign for the White House, told the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July that stripping regulation could allow the country to double its production of oil and gas, triggering a new "American energy renaissance."

Yet Continental's annual report, filed last month with the SEC, says environmental regulation - after eight years under the Obama administration - does not have a "material adverse effect on our operations to any greater degree than other similarly situated competitors."

Continental's competitors who reported actual spending on environmental compliance told investors that such expenses amount to a small percentage of operating revenues.

Fourteen of the 15 companies whose filings were reviewed by Reuters declined to comment on their statements to investors or the impact of regulation on their profits.

A spokesman for ConocoPhillips acknowledged that regulatory compliance has not had a material adverse impact on the company's liquidity or financial position. But red tape can be an unwelcome burden nonetheless.

"Changing, excessive, overlapping, duplicative and potentially conflicting regulations increase costs, cause potential delays and negatively impact investment decisions, with great cost to consumers of energy," the spokesman, Daren Beaudo, said in a written statement.

The American Petroleum Institute - which represents the U.S. oil and gas industry - also declined to comment.

Last month, before the U.S. Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, API President Jack Gerard said that the oil and gas industry has surged forward despite onerous regulations under the Obama administration.

"Technological innovations and industry leadership have propelled the oil and gas industry forward despite the unprecedented onslaught of 145 new and pending federal regulatory actions targeting our industry."

Though the industry saw a staunch opponent in Obama, oil and gas production soared more than 50 percent during his presidency. That was mainly because of high oil prices and improved hydraulic fracturing, a drilling technology that has allowed producers to access new reserves in previously tough-to -reach shale formations.

The rush of production ultimately contributed to a global glut that dropped crude oil prices from a high of over $100 a barrel in early 2014 to a low of nearly $25 by 2016. Current prices hover near $50 a barrel.

NO "MATERIAL" IMPACT

Four of the 15 companies reviewed by Reuters reported that spending on environmental matters - including new equipment or facilities, as well as fines and compliance staffing - amounted to a small fraction of revenues.

Exxon Mobil reported spending $4.9 billion worldwide in 2016, or about 2.24 percent of gross revenue. Occidental Petroleum , a much smaller company, reported spending $285 million, or about 2.82 percent of revenue. Neither addressed whether the spending was "material" in their filings.

Two other companies, ConocoPhillips and Chevron, also broke out their environmental spending while reporting that regulation had no material impact on their business. Conoco spent $627 million in 2016, or about 2.57 percent of gross revenue, while Chevron spent $2.1 billion, or 1.91 percent of gross revenue.

The other 11 companies did not break out spending, but all of them told the SEC that environmental regulation did not have a material impact on their business.

In one typical statement, EOG Resources , one of the biggest U.S. producers, told investors in a report filed last month: "Compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases EOG's overall cost of business, but has not had, to date, a material adverse effect on EOG's operations, financial condition or results of operations."

Devon Energy Corp , Anadarko Petroleum Corp , Pioneer Natural Resources Co , Apache Corp , and other large U.S.-focused oil and gas drillers used similar wording.

"ABSENCE OF A NEGATIVE"

Still, Obama's exit - and Trump's win over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in November - has been enough to brighten the outlook of some big investors.

"I believe the absence of a negative is a positive," John Dowd, who manages several energy funds at Fidelity Investments, wrote in his 2017 energy outlook. "The market has been concerned with the sustainability of fracking, and particularly to what extent it might have been regulated into obscurity by a different election outcome."

Clinton had said during her campaign that she planned to increase regulation on fracking.

Other segments of the energy industry, such as coal mining and oil refining, were harder hit by environmental protection measures during Obama's presidency. Several coal companies went bankrupt in recent years and blamed Obama's climate change initiatives for raising costs and hurting demand.

Refiners have also long complained that environmental regulations have stymied attempts to build new refineries and that they have borne the brunt of costly rules requiring them to blend biofuels into their gasoline.

Still, some energy analysts and regulation experts point out that the biggest drivers for these industries, too, tend to be supply and demand – not regulation.

The abundance of cheap natural gas is seen as the biggest obstacle to reviving coal country, since both fuels compete for space in the furnaces of U.S. power plants. For refiners, the key driver for profitability is the differential between the price of their raw material, crude oil, and the fuels they make with it.

"Supply and demand are the fundamental forces driving markets," said Coglianese, the University of Pennsylvania law professor. "Regulation is relatively trivial."

INSIGHT-As Trump targets energy rules, oil companies downplay their impact - 路透新闻

{{20170323T110002.463+0000}}INSIGHT-As Trump targets energy rules, oil companies downplay their impactBy Richard Valdmanis

BOSTON, March 23 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's White House has said his plans to slash environmental regulations will trigger a new energy boom and help the United States drill its way to independence from foreign oil.

But the top U.S. oil and gas companies have been telling their shareholders that regulations have little impact on their business, according to a Reuters review of U.S. securities filings from the top producers.

In annual reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 13 of the 15 biggest U.S. oil and gas producers said that compliance with current regulations is not impacting their operations or their financial condition.

The other two made no comment about whether their businesses were materially affected by regulation, but reported spending on compliance with environmental regulations at less than 3 percent of revenue.

The dissonance raises questions about whether Trump's war on regulation can increase domestic oil and gas output, as he has promised, or boost profits and share prices of oil and gas companies, as some investors have hoped.

According to the SEC, a publicly traded company must deem a matter "material" and report it to the agency if there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it important.

"Materiality is a fairly low bar," said Cary Coglianese, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who runs the university's research program on regulation. "Despite exaggerated claims, regulatory costs are usually a very small portion of many companies' cost of doing business."

The oil majors' annual filings come after the industry and its political allies have spent years criticizing the Obama administration for policies aimed at reducing fossil-fuel consumption, curtailing drilling on federal lands and subsidizing renewable energy.

Trump promised during the campaign that a rollback of the Democratic administration's policies would help free the nation from reliance on imported oil.

"Under my presidency, we will accomplish complete American energy independence," said Trump, describing regulation as a "self-inflicted wound."

The Trump administration is now preparing an executive order - dubbed the "Energy Independence" executive order - to roll back Obama-era regulations, which could be signed as early as this month, according to administration officials.

U.S. presidents have aimed to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil since the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, which triggered soaring prices. But the United States still imports about 7.9 million barrels of crude oil a day - almost enough meet total oil demand in Japan and India combined.

"ENERGY RENASSAINCE"

The Trump administration's attacks on regulation have been applauded by the oil industry.

"We haven't seen 3 percent growth in the economy for eight years, and I think part of the reason is that we've had a heavy dose of regulation," Chevron Corp. CEO John Watson said at CERAWeek, a global energy conference in Houston this month.

Continental Resources CEO, Harold Hamm, who advised Trump on energy issues during his campaign for the White House, told the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July that stripping regulation could allow the country to double its production of oil and gas, triggering a new "American energy renaissance."

Yet Continental's annual report, filed last month with the SEC, says environmental regulation - after eight years under the Obama administration - does not have a "material adverse effect on our operations to any greater degree than other similarly situated competitors."

Continental's competitors who reported actual spending on environmental compliance told investors that such expenses amount to a small percentage of operating revenues.

Fourteen of the 15 companies whose filings were reviewed by Reuters declined to comment on their statements to investors or the impact of regulation on their profits.

A spokesman for ConocoPhillips acknowledged that regulatory compliance has not had a material adverse impact on the company's liquidity or financial position. But red tape can be an unwelcome burden nonetheless.

"Changing, excessive, overlapping, duplicative and potentially conflicting regulations increase costs, cause potential delays and negatively impact investment decisions, with great cost to consumers of energy," the spokesman, Daren Beaudo, said in a written statement.

The American Petroleum Institute - which represents the U.S. oil and gas industry - also declined to comment.

Last month, before the U.S. Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, API President Jack Gerard said that the oil and gas industry has surged forward despite onerous regulations under the Obama administration.

"Technological innovations and industry leadership have propelled the oil and gas industry forward despite the unprecedented onslaught of 145 new and pending federal regulatory actions targeting our industry."

Though the industry saw a staunch opponent in Obama, oil and gas production soared more than 50 percent during his presidency. That was mainly because of high oil prices and improved hydraulic fracturing, a drilling technology that has allowed producers to access new reserves in previously tough-to -reach shale formations.

The rush of production ultimately contributed to a global glut that dropped crude oil prices from a high of over $100 a barrel in early 2014 to a low of nearly $25 by 2016. Current prices hover near $50 a barrel.

NO "MATERIAL" IMPACT

Four of the 15 companies reviewed by Reuters reported that spending on environmental matters - including new equipment or facilities, as well as fines and compliance staffing - amounted to a small fraction of revenues.

Exxon Mobil reported spending $4.9 billion worldwide in 2016, or about 2.24 percent of gross revenue. Occidental Petroleum , a much smaller company, reported spending $285 million, or about 2.82 percent of revenue. Neither addressed whether the spending was "material" in their filings.

Two other companies, ConocoPhillips and Chevron, also broke out their environmental spending while reporting that regulation had no material impact on their business. Conoco spent $627 million in 2016, or about 2.57 percent of gross revenue, while Chevron spent $2.1 billion, or 1.91 percent of gross revenue.

The other 11 companies did not break out spending, but all of them told the SEC that environmental regulation did not have a material impact on their business.

In one typical statement, EOG Resources , one of the biggest U.S. producers, told investors in a report filed last month: "Compliance with environmental laws and regulations increases EOG's overall cost of business, but has not had, to date, a material adverse effect on EOG's operations, financial condition or results of operations."

Devon Energy Corp , Anadarko Petroleum Corp , Pioneer Natural Resources Co , Apache Corp , and other large U.S.-focused oil and gas drillers used similar wording.

"ABSENCE OF A NEGATIVE"

Still, Obama's exit - and Trump's win over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in November - has been enough to brighten the outlook of some big investors.

"I believe the absence of a negative is a positive," John Dowd, who manages several energy funds at Fidelity Investments, wrote in his 2017 energy outlook. "The market has been concerned with the sustainability of fracking, and particularly to what extent it might have been regulated into obscurity by a different election outcome."

Clinton had said during her campaign that she planned to increase regulation on fracking.

Other segments of the energy industry, such as coal mining and oil refining, were harder hit by environmental protection measures during Obama's presidency. Several coal companies went bankrupt in recent years and blamed Obama's climate change initiatives for raising costs and hurting demand.

Refiners have also long complained that environmental regulations have stymied attempts to build new refineries and that they have borne the brunt of costly rules requiring them to blend biofuels into their gasoline.

Still, some energy analysts and regulation experts point out that the biggest drivers for these industries, too, tend to be supply and demand – not regulation.

The abundance of cheap natural gas is seen as the biggest obstacle to reviving coal country, since both fuels compete for space in the furnaces of U.S. power plants. For refiners, the key driver for profitability is the differential between the price of their raw material, crude oil, and the fuels they make with it.

"Supply and demand are the fundamental forces driving markets," said Coglianese, the University of Pennsylvania law professor. "Regulation is relatively trivial."

RPT-CORRECTED-East Timor to elect new president as oil revenues rapidly run dry - 路透新闻

{{20170320T041335.972+0000}}RPT-CORRECTED-East Timor to elect new president as oil revenues rapidly run dry(Corrects quote in paragraph 3 to make clear fields are mostly depleted, not money from the fields. Repeats to restore item to screens)

By Alexandre Assis

DILI, March 17 (Reuters) - East Timorese flocked to political rallies on the final day of campaigning ahead of Monday's presidential election, as Asia's youngest democracy grapples with persistent poverty and corruption at a time when oil revenues are rapidly running dry.

This year's presidential poll and parliamentary elections in July come as concerns mount over the failure to use wealth generated by oil and gas sales to support development and create jobs.

"The next five years with new leadership is a critical time because the currently used oil fields are mostly depleted," said Charles Scheiner of La'o Hamutuk, a Dili-based think-tank.

The challenge for any incoming government would be to wean the nation of 1.2 million people off oil and diversify its sources of income into agriculture and manufacturing, he said.

The energy sector accounted for around 60 percent of GDP in 2014 and more than 90 percent of government revenue.

Monday's election, the fourth since independence in 2002, is being contested by eight candidates.

Francisco "Lu Olo" Guterres, backed by the party that led the independence struggle, Fretilin, is a favorite to win the election. His chances were further enhanced by the endorsement of resistance hero Xanana Gusmao and his CNRT party, said Michael Leach of Australia's Swinburne University.

Police on Friday were keeping an eye on possibile unrest as candidates held rallies around Dili.

Supporters of Guterres in convoys of trucks chanted "Viva Lu Olo, Viva Fretilin, Viva CNRT" on their way to a rally about 15 km (9 miles) from the capital in Tasitolu.

"If I am later chosen to be president of East Timor, I will prioritise the economic and education sectors, to support the welfare of the people," Guterres said while campaigning.

Another leading candidate is Democratic Party politician Antonio da Conceicao. The education minister has called for "peaceful politics" in a country that has suffered communal violence. He has the backing his own party as well as the newly formed People's Liberation Party (PLP) of the incumbent president Jose Maria de Vasconcelos.

The president plays a largely ceremonial role, but it is an important post for underpinning unity, particularly with unemployment running at around 60 percent.

Vasconcelos, also know by his former guerrilla nickname "Taur Matan Ruak" (two sharp eyes), is expected to run for the more powerful prime minister's post in the July elections.

The new government will inherit a looming budget crunch as its main source of revenue, the Bayu-Udan field, operated by ConocoPhillips , is set to dry up in the next five years. That will put pressure on the government to resolve disputes with Australia that are holding back the development of a potential new source of revenue, the Greater Sunrise field.

The field is estimated to hold 5.1 trillion cubic feet of gas and 226 million barrels of condensates, which have been estimated to be worth $40 billion.

The former Portuguese colony was invaded by Indonesia in 1975. A 24-year resistance movement achieved independence in 2002 and many of its key figures still feature prominently in the running of the country.

Ownership of Norway's Nyhamna gas export plant to expand - 路透新闻

{{20170317T120644.092+0000}}Ownership of Norway's Nyhamna gas export plant to expand* Nyhamna can export up to 20 pct of Britain's gas needs

* Plant's ownership could rise to 13 firms from five

* Shell set to relinquish operatorship to Gassco

By Lefteris Karagiannopoulos

OSLO, March 17 (Reuters) - The ownership of Norway's Nyhamna gas-processing plant, a major supplier of energy to Britain, could expand to 13 companies this year from five now when Gassco succeeds Royal Dutch Shell as the facility's operator, Shell told Reuters.

Currently processing gas from the offshore Ormen Lange field, Nyhamna will also receive gas from Statoil's Aasta Hansteen and other fields from late 2018 via the new Polarled pipeline.

The plant exports gas to Britain via the Langeled pipeline, which can meet about 20 percent of Britain's gas needs.

A new ownership structure will reflect the addition of more gas input sources, allowing the Polarled owners to take stakes in the plant, Gassco said.

"We can confirm that the Nyhamna gas plant will become part of a new joint venture," said a Gassco spokeswoman, declining to comment on how the ownership will be split.

Gassco said Shell was expected to remain technical service provider (TSP) at Nyhamna, meaning the company will continue to handle daily operations, similar to the TSP role Statoil plays at the Gassco-operated Kaarstoe and Kollsnes gas plants.

"Shell is one of 13 parties with future ownership interests," Shell said in an email to Reuters, declining to elaborate further on the process.

The Nyhamna plant is currently owned by Ormen Lange license partners Norway's Petoro, Statoil, Shell, Denmark's DONG Energy and ExxonMobil .

Potential future owners include France's Total , Wintershall [WINT.UL], the oil and gas subsidiary of Germany's BASF , Italy's Edison , ConocoPhillips and Austria's OMV .

Norway's oil and energy ministry must approve the new ownership structure and set gas transportation tariffs that will ultimately impact the profitability of the pipelines and processing system.

"The decision (on tariffs) will be made before start-up of operations of the new facilities ... after a proposal is sent on public consultation," a ministry spokesman said.

* Australian PM in crisis talks with gas majors

* Australia faces gas shortage despite exports soaring

* Manufacturers desperate for cheaper gas

By Sonali Paul

SYDNEY, March 15 (Reuters) - Australia's top gas producers, led by ExxonMobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell , agreed to boost supply to the country's domestic market to help avert an energy shortage following crisis talks with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.

Australia is on track to become the world's largest exporter of liquified natural gas (LNG), yet its energy market operator has warned of a domestic gas crunch from 2019 that could trigger industry supply cuts and broad power outages.

"We are a massive gas exporter. It is utterly untenable - unacceptable - for us to be in a position where domestic gas consumers ... cannot have access to affordable gas," Turnbull told reporters on Wednesday after the meeting.

He said the producers had guaranteed to ensure that gas would be available for the national electricity market.

Australia's power supply problems made international headlines last week when Tesla Inc boss Elon Musk offered to save South Australia, the country's most renewable-energy dependent state, from blackouts by installing large-scale battery storage.

The South Australian government on Tuesday outlined plans to spend A$510 million ($385 million) to keep the lights on, including A$150 million to encourage the development of 100 megawatts of battery storage. [nL3N1GQ32M]

Australian manufacturers have long complained of tight gas supplies and soaring prices as producers have focused on supplying gas to LNG plants that have locked in 20-year export contracts. Three LNG plants have opened in the country over the past two years, which has tripled gas demand and sent gas prices rocketing from around A$6 a gigajoule (GJ) to as much as $22/GJ.

"That's apocalyptic as far as the cost structures of energy-intensive manufacturers are concerned," Tennant Reed, policy adviser at the Australian Industry Group, said at a gas outlook conference this week.

RESERVATION CALL

Companies like top Australian steel maker BlueScope Steel , fertiliser maker Incitec Pivot and packaging maker Orora Group have urged the government to reserve gas for the domestic market or risk losing thousands of jobs as plants shut.

Both sides of government have resisted a domestic gas reservation, acknowledging that would create sovereign risk for existing projects and threaten future investment in the country, but Turnbull left the door open to imposing a domestic quota.

"We've made considerable progress today, but there is more work to be done. But the considerable powers the Commonwealth has are obviously ones that we would never shirk from using in the national interest," he said.

Shell, which runs the Queensland Curtis LNG plant (QCLNG) and is sitting on undeveloped coal seam gas in the state, said it has sold significant volumes into southeastern Australia.

Diverting gas from LNG plants into the domestic market would be the easiest short-term solution, as two of the three LNG plants in Queensland - Shell's QCLNG and Origin and ConocoPhillips' Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) - have some capacity that is not locked into export contracts.

Turnbull said both QCLNG and APLNG had committed to being net suppliers to the domestic market, while Santos' Gladstone LNG, which is short of gas, had taken the request on notice.

A challenge, however, would be finding space on the gas pipeline network, said Saul Kavonic, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie.

Producers blame state drilling bans, uncertainty over Australia's climate policy and, more recently, potential increases in petroleum producer taxes, for deterring development of new gas fields.

Companies also reined in spending on exploration and development after the oil price collapse in 2014.

UPDATE 1-Trump seeks input from U.S. energy companies on Paris climate pact - 路透新闻

{{20170315T162808.641+0000}}UPDATE 1-Trump seeks input from U.S. energy companies on Paris climate pact(Adds comment from coal association, paragraphs 10 and 15; quote from Trump's 100-day action plan in paragraph 7)

By Valerie Volcovici and Timothy Gardner

WASHINGTON, March 15 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration has been contacting U.S. energy companies to ask them about their views on the U.N. global climate accord, according to two sources with knowledge of the effort, a sign Trump is reconsidering his 2016 campaign pledge to back out of the deal.

The sources, who asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak publicly on the subject, said many of the companies reached by the administration had said they would prefer the United States remain in the pact, but would also support reducing U.S. commitments in the deal.

The accord, agreed by nearly 200 countries in Paris in 2015, would limit planetary warming in part by slashing carbon dioxide and other emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. As part of the deal, the United States committed to reducing its emissions by between 26 and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.

The sources did not name the companies contacted.

One of the sources said the companies were "publicly traded fossil fuel companies," and added the White House would consider their input in making a decision on the Paris accord shortly. The source said the White House has been leading the discussions with the fossil fuel companies and the State Department, which represents the United States in climate negotiations, had not taken part.

A White House official declined to comment.

Trump has called climate change a hoax and vowed during his campaign for the White House to "cancel the Paris Climate Agreement" within 100 days, claiming it would be too costly for the U.S. economy.

Since being elected he has been mostly quiet on the issue. In a New York Times interview in November he said he would keep an open mind about the Paris deal. He and members of his family and inner circle also met with climate change advocate and former Vice President Al Gore in December.

Officials for Exxon Mobil , ConocoPhillips , Chevron , Peabody Energy Corp and others did not immediately comment when asked about whether they had been contacted by the White House about the Paris accord.

But several, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, have expressed public support for the pact. The World Coal Association, which represents Peabody and other miners, has also said it supports the deal.

OIL COMPANY SUPPORT

Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Darren Woods recently called the pledges that came out of the Paris agreement an "effective framework" for dealing with emissions, and pointed to Exxon's own work to cut its carbon emissions.

In comments on Exxon's website, Woods wrote: "I believe, and my company believes, that climate risks warrant action and it's going to take all of us – business, governments and consumers – to make meaningful progress."

Rex Tillerson, Exxon's former CEO and now U.S. Secretary of State, also supported remaining a part of the climate change discussion during his confirmation hearing. He said he did not see climate change as an imminent national security threat but said the U.S. would be "better served by being at that table" and remaining a party to climate change negotiations.

Conoco CEO Ryan Lance similarly said he favored the U.S. remaining in the Paris agreement, during CERAWeek comments last week, in part because it could create opportunities for its natural gas operations and its investments in carbon-capture and storage.

Benjamin Sporton, the president of the World Coal Association, had a similar stance: "With a number of well-developed carbon capture and storage projects, the United States is already a global leader in cleaner coal technology. Given the role given to low emissions coal technology in the Paris Agreement by many developing economies, there are clear benefits to remaining within the agreement."

J. Robinson West, former chairman of Magellan Petroleum Corp., and now a managing director at Boston Consulting Group, said President Trump's anti-Paris accord sentiments probably reflected his dealings with the CEOs of smaller companies that operate only in the U.S.

"The independents are anti-climate change ... all this stuff costs them money. The global companies operate all over the world. They have to operate at one standard - the highest standard - wherever they operate," he said.

Global oil companies have spent heavily on environmental initiatives in recent years. Exxon Mobil, for example, logged $4.9 billion in environmental spending in 2016, about 2.24 percent of total revenue, according to its annual report with the Securities and Exchanges Commission. ConocoPhillips spent $627 million, or 2.57 percent of revenue.

J. Robinson West, former chairman of Magellan Petroleum Corp., and now a managing director at Boston Consulting Group, says President Trump's anti-Paris accord sentiments probably reflect his dealings with the CEOs of smaller oil companies that operate only in the U.S., not the major oil companies.

"There are two classes of companies – the independents, which are much more influential with this administration, and the global oil companies. The independents are anti-climate change ... all this stuff costs them money. The global companies operate all over the world. They have to operate at one standard - the highest standard - wherever they operate."

Global oil companies have spent heavily on environmental regulation compliance in recent years. Exxon Mobil, for example, logged $4.9 billion in environmental spending in 2016, about 2.24 percent of total revenue, according to its annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ConocoPhillips, meanwhile, spent $627 million, or 2.57 percent of revenue.

{{20170315T064055.396+0000}}UPDATE 3-Australia hauls in gas majors to avert local shortage* Australian PM in crisis talks with gas majors

* Australia faces gas shortage despite exports soaring

* Manufacturers desperate for cheaper gas

(Recasts with result of meeting, fresh quotes)

By Sonali Paul

SYDNEY, March 15 (Reuters) - Australia's top gas producers, led by ExxonMobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell , agreed to boost supply to the country's domestic market to help avert an energy shortage following crisis talks with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.

Australia is on track to become the world's largest exporter of liquified natural gas (LNG), yet its energy market operator has warned of a domestic gas crunch from 2019 that could trigger industry supply cuts and broad power outages.

"We are a massive gas exporter. It is utterly untenable - unacceptable - for us to be in a position where domestic gas consumers ... cannot have access to affordable gas," Turnbull told reporters on Wednesday after the meeting.

He said the producers had guaranteed to ensure that gas would be available for the national electricity market.

Australia's power supply problems made international headlines last week when Tesla Inc boss Elon Musk offered to save South Australia, the country's most renewable-energy dependent state, from blackouts by installing large-scale battery storage.

The South Australian government on Tuesday outlined plans to spend A$510 million ($385 million) to keep the lights on, including A$150 million to encourage the development of 100 megawatts of battery storage. [nL3N1GQ32M]

Australian manufacturers have long complained of tight gas supplies and soaring prices as producers have focused on supplying gas to LNG plants that have locked in 20-year export contracts. Three LNG plants have opened in the country over the past two years, which has tripled gas demand and sent gas prices rocketing from around A$6 a gigajoule (GJ) to as much as $22/GJ.

"That's apocalyptic as far as the cost structures of energy-intensive manufacturers are concerned," Tennant Reed, policy adviser at the Australian Industry Group, said at a gas outlook conference this week.

RESERVATION CALL

Companies like top Australian steel maker BlueScope Steel , fertiliser maker Incitec Pivot and packaging maker Orora Group have urged the government to reserve gas for the domestic market or risk losing thousands of jobs as plants shut.

Both sides of government have resisted a domestic gas reservation, acknowledging that would create sovereign risk for existing projects and threaten future investment in the country, but Turnbull left the door open to imposing a domestic quota.

"We've made considerable progress today, but there is more work to be done. But the considerable powers the Commonwealth has are obviously ones that we would never shirk from using in the national interest," he said.

Shell, which runs the Queensland Curtis LNG plant (QCLNG) and is sitting on undeveloped coal seam gas in the state, said it has sold significant volumes into southeastern Australia.

Diverting gas from LNG plants into the domestic market would be the easiest short-term solution, as two of the three LNG plants in Queensland - Shell's QCLNG and Origin and ConocoPhillips' Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) - have some capacity that is not locked into export contracts.

Turnbull said both QCLNG and APLNG had committed to being net suppliers to the domestic market, while Santos' Gladstone LNG, which is short of gas, had taken the request on notice.

A challenge, however, would be finding space on the gas pipeline network, said Saul Kavonic, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie.

Producers blame state drilling bans, uncertainty over Australia's climate policy and, more recently, potential increases in petroleum producer taxes, for deterring development of new gas fields.

Companies also reined in spending on exploration and development after the oil price collapse in 2014.

{{20170314T221248.335+0000}}Australia hauls in gas majors to boost local supply, cap pricesBy Sonali Paul

SYDNEY, March 15 (Reuters) - Australia's top gas producers, led by ExxonMobil Corp and Royal Dutch Shell , are set to come under fire to supply more gas to the local market and curb soaring prices in crisis talks on Wednesday with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.

The meeting comes days after Australia's energy market operator warned the country faces a gas crunch from 2019 that could trigger supply cuts to industry or power outages for lack of gas for generation.

This is happening even as the country is on track to become the world's top exporter of liquefied natural gas.

"What I'm seeking to do is to ensure we have action from the gas companies," Turnbull told reporters in Canberra.

"I can say that the gas companies, I have no doubt, are very well aware they operate with the benefit of a social licence from the Australian people. And they cannot expect to maintain that if, while billions of dollars of gas are being exported, Australians are left short."

Manufacturers who need gas have long complained they faced tight supplies and soaring prices as producers have been focused on supplying gas to the LNG plants that have locked in 20-year export contracts.

UPDATE 2-Qatargas agrees to double LNG supplies to Poland - 路透新闻

{{20170314T151846.728+0000}}UPDATE 2-Qatargas agrees to double LNG supplies to Poland(Adds PGNiG quote)

DUBAI/WARSAW, March 14 (Reuters) - State-owned Qatargas has agreed to double volumes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) it supplies to Poland's gas firm PGNiG to 2 million tonnes per year at a price that may have positive impact on PGNiG's bottom line, the companies said.

The agreement comes as Poland is struggling to reduce its reliance on supplies of Russian gas, while a deepening global gas glut offers opportunities to bring in cheap LNG from Qatar and elsewhere.

For Qatar, which faces competition from Australian and U.S. producers, supply deals into Europe offer a valuable option as Asia's gas-consuming economies rein in new deals in light of a growing supply overhang.

The deal is a side agreement to a long term-contract PGNiG and Qatargas signed in 2009.

The companies then agreed that Qatargas will deliver to Poland around 1 million tonnes or around 1.5 billion cubic metres (BCM) of gas annually for 20 years starting from 2014. At the time PGNiG estimated the deal's annual average value at around $550 million, based on prevailing oil prices.

The price in the side agreement was not revealed but PGNiG said pricing terms were "satisfactory" and expected to have a "positive impact" on its financial results.

An industry source said Qatargas's expanded deal with Poland likely came with a price discount – which PGNIG had been in talks to secure for several years after paying at the peak of the market last time around.

"We have conducted the talks for a few months. It was the best offer. (...) This is now the biggest Qatargas contract of this type in Europe," PGNiG deputy head Maciej Wozniak told a conference on Tuesday, repeating he could not reveal the price.

The new deal will come into effect at the start of 2018 and run until June 2034.

The LNG will be supplied from Qatar Liquefied Gas Co, a joint venture between Qatar Petroleum, ConocoPhillips and Mitsui & Co <8031.T>, and will be delivered by Q-Flex LNG vessels to the LNG terminal in Swinoujscie at the Baltic Sea.

Poland's first LNG terminal on the Baltic Sea coast started commercial operations in summer last year and has been Poland's flagship project to reduce the country's reliance on supplies from Russia's Gazprom .

PGNiG also plans to build a gas link to Norway to receive up to 10 bcm of gas annually from the North Sea after 2022 when its long-term deal on gas supplies with Gazprom expires.

Poland, which consumes around 16 bcm of gas annually, also wants to buy more gas on the spot market.

Qatargas agrees to boost LNG supplies to Poland - 路透新闻

{{20170314T074413.262+0000}}Qatargas agrees to boost LNG supplies to PolandDUBAI, March 14 (Reuters) - State-owned Qatargas said on Tuesday it had agreed to increase the volume of liquefied natural gas which it supplies to Polish Oil and Gas Co to 2 million tonnes per year.

The new deal will come into effect at the start of 2018 and run until June 2034, it said. Poland has been trying to diversify away from its reliance on Russian pipeline gas.

The LNG will be supplied from Qatar Liquefied Gas Co, a joint venture between Qatar Petroleum, ConocoPhillips and Mitsui & Co <8031.T>, and will be delivered by Q-Flex LNG vessels to the President Lech Kaczynski LNG Terminal in Swinoujscie, Poland.

A long-term deal signed in 2009 provided for Poland to import 1.3 billion cubic metres of LNG from Qatar annually, and those deliveries began last June.

UPDATE 1-Libya's oil output drops to 620,000 bpd -NOC head - 路透新闻

{{20170309T222815.452+0000}}UPDATE 1-Libya's oil output drops to 620,000 bpd -NOC head(Adds details, background)

TRIPOLI, March 9 (Reuters) - Libya's oil output has fallen to 620,000 barrels per day, a drop of about 80,000 bpd since clashes erupted around some of the country's major export terminals, the head of the National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Thursday.

Mustafa Sanalla told Reuters that production by Waha Oil Co, a joint venture between NOC and foreign partners, had been entirely halted. Waha pumps oil to Es Sider, one of two ports that the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) lost control of last Friday to a rival faction.

A port official at Ras Lanuf, a neighbouring terminal that the LNA also withdrew from, said that production by another NOC joint venture, Harouge Oil Operations, had also been affected, without giving details.

Libyan oil officials say staff at Es Sider and Ras Lanuf have been reduced to a minimum since a faction known as the Benghazi Defence Brigades (BDB) seized them in clashes, and that the area is effectively a military zone.

The BDB say they have handed the ports over to a Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) force sanctioned by the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli, and that they would allow oil to flow.

However, the clashes are a new challenge to Libyan efforts to boost output, which had more than doubled since the LNA took over the Oil Crescent ports in September and ended a long blockade. [nL5N1GM7XH]

Es Sider and Ras Lanuf have a potential joint capacity of 600,000 bpd, but had been exporting a fraction of that partly due to damage in previous violence.

National production earlier this week had been relatively stable at around 670,000 bpd.

Brega and Zueitina, two other ports on the stretch of coastline southwest of Benghazi known as the Oil Crescent, remain under LNA control.

Waha Oil Co is a joint venture between the NOC, Marathon Oil Corp, Hess Corporation and ConocoPhillips. Harouge is a joint venture between the NOC and Canada's Suncor.

UPDATE 2-Shell sells Canadian oil sands, ties bonuses to emissions cuts - Reuters News

{{20170309T211304.108+0000}}UPDATE 2-Shell sells Canadian oil sands, ties bonuses to emissions cuts* Shell sells interests in new, existing oil sands projects

* Buys half of Marathon Oil Canada

* Total deal value of $7.25 bln for Shell

* Ties 10 pct of directors' bonuses to emissions management

(Adds Marathon Oil details)

By Karolin Schaps

LONDON, March 9 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell has agreed to sell most of its Canadian oil sands assets for $8.5 billion, the latest international oil major to withdraw from the costly and carbon-heavy projects.

Shell is trying to sell assets totalling $30 billion to cut debt following its $54 billion acquisition of BG Group and is under investor pressure to mitigate climate change risks.

Shell also said on Thursday that 10 percent of directors' bonuses will now be tied to how well it manages greenhouse gas emissions in refining, chemical and upstream operations. [nL8N1DU5G2][nL1N1EG1QZ]

Analysts welcomed the deal, under which Shell has agreed to sell its existing and undeveloped Canadian oil sands interests to Canadian Natural Resources and to cut its share in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (AOSP) to 10 percent from 60 percent.

"This significant divestment should help de-gear Shell's balance sheet over 2017 and help remove concerns around the dividend," said Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.

Shell is also buying half of Marathon Oil Canada Corp , which brings the deal's value for Shell to $7.25 billion and its divestment plan total to around $20 billion, as it works towards its target of $30 billion by late 2018.

Other oil firms including Exxon Mobil , Conoco Phillips and Statoil have written down or sold their Canadian oil sand assets. [nL2N1GC0FG]

Shell said it would remain as operator of the AOSP Scotford upgrader and the Quest carbon capture and storage project.

MARATHON MOVES

Separately, Marathon Oil said it would spend $1.1 billion for roughly 70,000 acres in the Permian Basin in a deal with privately-held BC Operating Inc, using proceeds from the Shell deal to expand in the largest U.S. oilfield.

The move comes as Exxon, Pioneer Natural Resources Co and others have ramped up operations in the Permian, one of the cheapest places to pump oil in the United States.

That has drawn interest from investors all over the world. The oil industry poured more than $28 billion into land acquisitions last year in the Permian - more than triple what was spent there a year earlier.[nL1N1FM1EO]

Marathon Oil inked the deal for far less than many peers have recently done in similar transactions, paying roughly $13,900 per acre, factoring in existing production. Some recent acreage deals in the Permian have eclipsed $50,000 per acre.

The company plans to immediately boost spending on the new acreage by adding a drilling rig.

Shares of Marathon rose 8.1 percent to $16.07 on the New York Stock Exchange. ($1 = 0.9482 euros)

REFILE-EXCLUSIVE-Saudis tell U.S. oil: OPEC won't extend cuts to offset shale - sources - 路透新闻

* Saudi officials held closed-door meet with five U.S. producers

* Saudis warn executives OPEC won't take hit for more shale supply

By Ron Bousso

HOUSTON, March 9 (Reuters) - Senior Saudi energy officials told top independent U.S. oil firms in a closed-door meeting this week that they should not assume OPEC would extend output curbs to offset rising production from U.S. shale fields, two industry sources told Reuters on Thursday.

Oil producers led by Saudi Arabia and top non-OPEC exporter Russia are in an uneasy truce with U.S. shale firms after a two-year price war that sent many shale producers to the wall. The Saudis and Russia led a deal to curb output in late 2016 to end a global supply glut that pushed oil prices to a 12-year low.

The resulting rise in oil prices has sparked a rush of new output by shale producers, who this week outlined ambitious production growth plans across the United States.[nL2N1GM037]

Speaking at an industry conference in the U.S. energy capital of Houston on Tuesday, Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said that there would be no "free rides" for U.S. shale producers benefiting from the upturn. [nL2N1GK0XX]

Falih's senior advisors went a step further at the meeting on Tuesday evening with executives from Anadarko , ConocoPhillips , Occidental Petroleum Corp , Pioneer Natural Resources , Newfield Exploration and EOG Resources .

"One of the advisors said that OPEC would not take the hit for the rise in U.S. shale production," a U.S. executive who was at the meeting told Reuters. "He said we and other shale producers should not automatically assume OPEC will extend the cuts."

The Saudis called the meeting to exchange views on the market and to gauge the outlook for shale output, both sources said.

Both sources spoke about the meeting on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.

A spokesman for Conoco declined to comment on the meeting. The five other U.S. companies represented at the meeting did not respond to requests for comment.

Saudi energy officials also declined to comment.

The meeting came after OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo met hedge funds and shale producers in Houston earlier in the week, seeking to widen talks on how to tame the global glut.[nL2N1GK1SA]

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries joined forces with Russia and several other non-OPEC producers last November and pledged to cut production by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) for six months starting Jan. 1.

Falih said on Tuesday that global inventories had fallen more slowly than he expected in the first two months of the year, although oil market fundamentals were improving as a result of the curbs.

On Wednesday, oil prices plunged 5 percent to lowest levels this year after U.S. crude inventories surged to a record high, in part because of rising output from shale producers. The price continued to fall on Thursday. [nL2N1GM0S0]

The inventory rise stoked concern that the glut could persist because shale supply, along with more output from Brazil and Canada, could offset output cuts by OPEC and some non-OPEC suppliers.[O/R]

The U.S. government expects U.S. oil output to rise 330,000 bpd in 2017, mostly from shale, but some analysts and producers are forecasting the increase could be more than double that amount.

OPEC next meets on May 25 in Vienna to discuss supply policy, and is expected to decide there on whether to extend supply curbs implemented on Jan. 1.

In a joint news conference on Tuesday, Falih, Russian Oil Minister Alexander Novak, Mexican Deputy Secretary of Energy Aldo Flores, Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi and Secretary-General Barkindo, said they were happy with compliance by the pact's members so far.

Unlike the OPEC and non-OPEC state-run producers that have agreed to curb output, there is no mechanism for U.S. independent producers and global oil majors to restrain output. Their imperatives are commercial, and they produce as much oil as they can at profit.

U.S. shale firms lift reserves while oil majors take Canada hit - 路透新闻

{{20170309T173539.098+0000}}U.S. shale firms lift reserves while oil majors take Canada hitBy Swetha Gopinath and Arathy S Nair

March 8 (Reuters) - Top shale oil producers are lifting their crude and gas reserve estimates for the first time in two years - even as many major oil companies are cutting the same projections and taking write downs on more expensive fields.

Rising confidence in the growth prospects of the U.S. shale patch is in striking contrast to the retreat of the world's top oil firms from the high-cost oil sands of Canada.

The increase in reported shale reserves is driven by new drilling efficiencies, leaner operations and improved well completion techniques, industry experts said.

"Many wells that were not profitable a year ago have become profitable" because those advances have cut the cost of producing from shale, said Per Magnus Nysveen, a senior partner at consultancy Rystad Energy.

The top 20 U.S. shale firms - a group that includes Pioneer Natural Resources Co and Chesapeake Energy Corp, - hiked their proved oil reserves by nearly 7 percent on average in 2016, according to a Reuters review of year-end financial filings.

While shale producers reap the benefits of technological advances, oil majors that bet billions of dollars on giant long-term projects in Canada have taken a hit.

On Thursday, Royal Dutch Shell plc became the latest energy giant to quit on oil sands. Shell said it would remove 2 billion barrels of oil from its reserves and take a $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion after-tax impairment in a retreat from most of its Canadian oil sands operations. [nL5N1GM1VZ]

Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips last month reported total reductions of nearly 5 billion barrels of proved reserves from oil sands projects after deciding they could not be pumped at current prices.

Overall, the 10 U.S. oil companies with the largest holdings in conventional oil fields reduced their reserves by 13.4 percent in 2016, according to a Reuters' analysis of year-end regulatory filings.

SHALE TURNAROUND

In 2015, the same shale firms, a group which do not operate in conventional oil fields, reported that proved reserves had fallen by 13 percent on average as low oil prices made many fields unprofitable.

Firms operating in shale oil fields use hydraulic fracturing to tap oil in rock formations that cannot be accessed by conventional drilling methods.

The reserves reflect oil and gas that can be profitably tapped in the next five years and are valued by investors as a measure of future revenue growth. Greater reserves also can give the companies more borrowing power.

The 2016 shale reserve gains, while modest, came as conventional drillers were paring back their own estimates as oil prices remain below the levels needed to make output from higher cost fields profitable. The cost of pumping a barrel of oil from Canada's oil sands is much higher than the cost of producing oil from shale.

The reported 2016 increases in shale reserves are based on U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and use an average West Texas Intermediate oil price of $42.75 per barrel in 2016.

The oil price on Thursday fell below $50 per barrel amid worries about growing crude inventories, especially from shale producers.

Shale producers' reported natural gas reserves were based on a $2.49 per million British Thermal Units (MMBtu) average price in 2016, down from $2.58 a year earlier.

Recent production increases from U.S. shale fields have rattled OPEC producers aiming to pare global crude inventories. In remarks to industry executives at an energy conference in Houston this week, Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih warned that OPEC won't accept shale oil rivals getting "free rides" from its production cutbacks.

The implied threat was that OPEC could reverse the output cuts, which took effect in January, and flood the world market with oil, kicking off another price war. The curbs have boosted oil prices and in turn revived the shale industry in the United States after a two-year downturn.

BOOST FROM TECHNOLOGY

The technological improvements in shale fields include the ability to drill further into the earth, both vertically and horizontally, creating more underground sites in each well for hydraulic fracturing.

"Reserve growth really comes down to better well design," said Michael Dynan, vice president for portfolio and strategic development at Schramm, a manufacturer of drilling rigs.

Such changes are helping oil firms tap more oil and gas while keeping spending low. Continental Resources Inc says it found twice the reserves per dollar spent in 2016 than in 2014.

More recently, producers have also embraced big data analysis techniques that are providing "a lot of insight into how best to drill a well, where to locate a well and the fracking techniques to use," said Binu Mathew, who heads digital products at GE Oil & Gas, which is merging with Baker Hughes Inc .

Such advances are only the beginning of the shale oil industry's efforts to wring more oil from wells for less money, said Stephen Ingram, southern region director of Halliburton Co's completion and production business.

HIGHER CONFIDENCE

Another factor in aiding reserves is the sharp decline last year in fees charged by oilfield service suppliers.

Oilfield service firms are looking to take back some of the discounts they extended during the downturn, but shale producers say they expect to hold the line on expenses as they continue to expand production. [nL1N1G12BF]

Some of the reported gains in reserves are coming from un-drilled acreage, which makes them less certain. At least six of the companies Reuters analyzed reported a rise in proved reserves based on undeveloped properties in 2016.

Investors have increasing faith in the profit potential of such undeveloped properties, however.

"Confidence is very high that they are going to be turned into proved, producing assets," said Todd Heltman, a senior energy analyst at investment firm Neuberger Berman.

Still, some investors worry that shale firms are becoming too aggressive about booking undeveloped reserves.

"There is no geological risk here, but if your wells don't live up to your expectations, you have negative reserve revisions," said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood Holdings Group, referring to downgrading proved reserves to uneconomic-to-tap categories.

CERAWEEK-OPEC invites U.S. shale firms, hedge funds into talks on glut - 路透新闻

{{20170308T001623.741+0000}}CERAWEEK-OPEC invites U.S. shale firms, hedge funds into talks on glut(Adds details)

By Liz Hampton and Marianna Parraga

HOUSTON, March 7 (Reuters) - The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is moving to bring U.S. shale producers and hedge funds into widening talks about how best to tame a global oil glut.

The group held unprecedented talks with fund executives on Tuesday and earlier held meetings with shale producers, including Pioneer Natural Resources Co and ConocoPhillips .

The introductory discussions were the first bilateral meetings with shale producers and investment funds, OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo said on Tuesday at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston.

The two have become important players in adding production to a world awash in crude oil. Cheap financing for newer producers has forced majors to turn their focus from big, long-term projects to those that can generate quick cash for their investors.

Last November, OPEC took initial steps to widen its market reach as it sought to end a two-year price war, striking a historic agreement with 13 non-member countries, including such major oil producing nations as Russia, Kazakhstan and Mexico.

Saudi Arabia Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih separately told a group of oil industry executives at the conference that the November pact set a new "cooperative framework" for OPEC to address short-term market turmoil. [nL2N1GK132]

"All of us realize that such an expanded network of producers with a larger share of global production is the only way to achieve a constructive, stable market for all," he said.

The discussions with hedge funds come as their role in U.S. energy has grown. Funds have become major equity financiers of young U.S. oil firms and in some cases owners of production assets in expanding basins including the Permian in West Texas.

The outreach is expected to continue. Any decision to extend the OPEC-led production cuts beyond June would have to include the continued participation by the non-OPEC countries, Secretary General Barkindo said.

"I think we have broken the ice between ourselves and the industry, particularly the tight oil producers and the hedge funds who have become major players in the oil market," he said in remarks on the conference sidelines.

OPEC plans to hold an event to consider the impact of oil futures on physical crude markets, Barkindo said, without providing details.

Scott Sheffield, executive chairman of Pioneer, said the meeting on Sunday between shale producers and OPEC officials reflects an extraordinary change in the relationship between the two groups, whose interests sometimes are in conflict.

"I've seen more dialogue between OPEC and shale producers this year than ever before," he said.

The November deal to reduce output is intended to shave global output by about 1.8 million barrels per day, and reduce a supply estimated to be about 300 million barrels above the norm weighing on crude prices. The six-month agreement took effect on Jan. 1.

Compliance with the production curbs among top global oil producers should improve in February from January's level, Barkindo said. Members of the production accord last month reported 86 percent of the reduction target had been met in the early weeks of the agreement. [nL8N1G88EM]

The OPEC-led accord has helped increase crude prices by more than 10 percent since the agreement was struck in November.

OPEC plans to meet again in May.

TABLE-VLCC from U.S. Gulf Coast carrying crude to Asia - 路透新闻

{{20170301T191619.130+0000}}TABLE-VLCC from U.S. Gulf Coast carrying crude to AsiaMarch 1 (Reuters) - A Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) carrying an estimated 2 million barrels of U.S. oil is
bound for Asia, according to sources and Reuters Trade Flows data.

The Shaybah loaded in the Galveston Offshore Lightering Zone in mid-February and is currently en route to
Singapore, according to the data.

It was not immediately clear which company was moving the oil. One source said the vessel is co-loaded with
Thunderhorse crude and Southern Green Canyon, both produced in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. So far, no Asian refiners
have taken Thunderhorse crude.

The move comes as the spread between U.S. crude and global benchmarks widened, making exports of domestic oil
economic.

For the first three quarters of 2016 exports, see: [nL1N1EZ155]

UPDATE 2-Eni looks to strong project pipeline to boost growth - 路透新闻

{{20170301T163332.078+0000}}UPDATE 2-Eni looks to strong project pipeline to boost growth* Sees operating cash flow of 47 bln euros by 2020

* To sell assets worth 5-7 bln euros to 2020

* Deal on Mozambique stake sale "not far"

* To cut capex by 8 pct vs previous plan

* Q4 adjusted net profit 459 million euros

* Shares up, outperform sector peers

(Recasts lead with plan, adds CEO comments, shares, analyst)

By Stephen Jewkes and Ron Bousso

MILAN/LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - Italy's Eni reported its first quarterly profit in 18 months and said it expects oil and gas production to rise 3 percent per year over the next four years after a string of high profile discoveries.

Eni, the biggest foreign oil major in Africa which accounts for more than 50 percent of its output, has made major gas finds in Mozambique and Egypt, and said on Wednesday it was looking to add up to 3 billion barrels of new resources out to 2020 even as it cut investments by 13 percent.

Earlier Eni beat expectations with fourth quarter adjusted net profit of 459 million euros ($484 million) helped by lower spending and higher oil prices.

"We've never had such a strong set of projects in our history," Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi said during a conference call with analysts on the group's 2017-2020 plan.

State-owned Eni said its organic reserve replacement ratio -- a measure of its ability to find hydrocarbons -- stood at 193 percent in 2016 compared to a 35 percent peer average.

Exxon Mobil Corp , the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, failed to replace 100 percent of its oil and gas reserves with new projects last year while ConocoPhillips Corp revised down proved reserves. [nL1N1G723D]

Eni, which will reap the benefit of a ramp-up at Kazakhstan's giant Kashagan field, expects output this year to jump by 5 percent as key projects in Angola, Ghana, Indonesia and Egypt come on stream ahead of schedule.

To deal with the gas finds, the company said it aimed to develop its liquefied natural gas (LNG) business.

"We can create a strong portfolio... the aim is to reach 10 million tonnes of LNG per year by 2025," Descalzi said.

Since taking over as CEO in 2014, Descalzi has refocused the group on the upstream (E&P) business of finding oil and gas.

The veteran oilman, previously head of Eni's E&P unit, has won plaudits from investors for steering Eni through the oil market slump by discovering prize acreage, cutting costs and selling assets.

But his mandate comes up for renewal in the coming weeks and there is some concern his position could be undermined by a corruption probe over a Nigerian oilfield. [nL5N1FT439]

"Upstream growth at Eni is well supported by significant organic resource access and while transformation is still in progress there's lots of value still to unlock," said Santander analyst Jason Kenney.

Eni said it would pay a dividend of 0.8 euros per share in 2017, the same as the previous year.

Under its so-called "dual exploration" strategy, Eni aims to sell down stakes in oil and gas fields it operates to raise cash to fund future development and support dividends.

The company, which will generate cash flow of 47 billion euros from operations over the next 4 years, said it was targeting asset sales of 5-7 billion euros to 2020.

"Around 60 percent of that will be in 2017-2018 and some 3-4 billion euros will come from diluting our stakes in fields we operate," CFO Massimo Mondazzi said.

Eni last year sold an overall stake of 40 percent in its giant Zohr field in Egypt to Rosneft and BP for around $2.1 billion. [nL5N1E722C]

Sources have said Exxon Mobil has clinched a deal to buy a stake in the group's Area 4 concession in Mozambique but that an announcement would not be made for some time.

Descalzi said a deal to sell a stake in the Mozambique field was "not far" away, adding Eni would remain operator of a part of the field.

At 1627 GMT Eni shares were up 2.8 percent, outperforming a 1.6 percent rise in Europe's oil index <.SXEP>. ($1 = 0.9474 euros)
