NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday withdrawing the country from the Paris climate accord would stave off an economic crisis and protect American jobs - but many American companies seemed to disagree.

Criticism of his decision rolled in from blue-chip companies like Facebook Inc , Apple Inc , Ford Motor Co and Microsoft Corp , while the response from fossil fuel groups with the most to gain from a relaxation of U.S. carbon emissions standards was muted.

Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger said they would leave White House advisory councils over Trump's decision. [nL3N1IY5QF]

In an interview on Thursday, the president of the World Coal Association, Benjamin Sporton, told Reuters that he had mixed feelings about Trump's announcement, adding he was eager to see a U.S. policy that actively promotes a place for coal in the global energy mix.

"What we really need to see, if the president wants to re-enter the deal, is that he can change the agreement to recognize the role of all sources of energy, including coal," Sporton said, adding his group had described to administration officials the benefits of remaining in the agreement.

The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's biggest trade group, meanwhile, issued a statement saying it had never taken an official position on the Paris accord.

A number of its members, including Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips , had publicly supported the deal.

"For us, our position on the Paris agreement... we need a framework like that to address the risks of climate change," Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods told reporters on the sidelines of the company's annual general meeting on Wednesday. [nL1N1IX15V]

Some other groups expressed measured support for Trump's decision, saying it provided an opportunity to fix problems with the deal.

"Manufacturers support the spirit of the Paris Agreement and the effort to address climate change through a fair international agreement. But as the president has acknowledged, certain elements of this deal were not equitable for U.S. manufacturers," said Ross Eisenberg, vice president for energy and resources policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, in a statement to Reuters.

A spokesman for Peabody Energy Corp , America's largest publicly traded coal miner, had said on Wednesday that the company would support a decision by Trump to withdraw from the Paris deal because the "accord is flawed on a number of levels."

Trump vowed during his campaign to pull the United States out of the Paris deal, arguing the pact would cost the United States trillions of dollars, kill jobs, and stymie economic growth without providing tangible benefit.

His critics have argued, however, that the risks of climate change require action, and that a shift to a low-carbon energy economy can create more jobs than it eliminates.

"A SETBACK"

Spokespeople for other extractive oil and mining groups, like the National Mining Association and the American Fuel & Petrochemicals Manufacturers, declined to comment on Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris accord.

But a number of other business leaders derided it in forceful terms.

"Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world," said Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein in his first-ever tweet. [nL1N1IY2CK]

"Disappointed with today's decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government," tweeted General Electric Co's Jeff Immelt.

Apple's CEO Tim Cook, meanwhile, posted to Twitter: "Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet" and "Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver".

"Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children's future at risk," wrote Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post.

TABLE-U.S. crude exports head to Asia and Latam in April-May - 路透新闻

{{20170531T150002.494+0000}}TABLE-U.S. crude exports head to Asia and Latam in April-MayMay 31 (Reuters) - Oil traders have exported at least 18 cargoes of U.S. crude so far in the second quarter and
are looking to ship more to Asia and Latin America through June, traders and brokers said.

Trading sources said in recent weeks that oil tankers carrying more than 10 million barrels of U.S. crude were on
en route to Asia to take advantage of favorable price spreads. [nL2N1IK03Z]

Brokers added this week that interest continues to rise for vessels to the East. In May, U.S. exports of crude
have averaged some 800,000 barrels per day, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data, up from 736,000
bpd in April.

Meanwhile, BP  has resumed sales of U.S. light crude to Venezuelan oil company PDVSA, after being awarded a
tender in late April along with state-owned China National Petroleum Corp to ship up to four 500,000-barrel cargoes
of West Texas Intermediate or Domestic Sweet Blend (DSW) crudes to a terminal operated by the state-run firm in
Curacao.

The British major last year sold 13 cargoes of U.S. oil to PDVSA, but payment issues caused long delays to
discharge most of them. Since then, it had not shipped U.S. crude to Curacao until chartering the Aframax tanker
Tulip, which arrived in the Bullenbay terminal on May 18, according to Reuters vessel tracking data.

Company climate risk disclosure would distort markets -IHS Markit - 路透新闻

{{20170511T040101.518+0000}}Company climate risk disclosure would distort markets -IHS MarkitBy Nina Chestney

LONDON, May 11 (Reuters) - Proposals by a G20-backed task force for companies to disclose how they manage climate risks would mislead investors and distort markets, according to research by analytics and data provider IHS Markit on Thursday.

Last year, the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), set up by the G20's Financial Stability Board, proposed that companies disclose in their public financial findings how they identify and manage risks to their business from climate change. [nL5N1E94RG]

Although the measures are voluntary, some of the task force's members argue they should become mandatory.

The TCFD was set up due to growing concerns among the financial community that assets are being mispriced because the full extent of climate risk is not being factored in and increased calls for company transparency.

IHS Markit said some of the TCFD's proposals could help investors better understand how firms manage potential climate risks but others would actually undermine the aim of improving capital allocation decisions and financial market functioning.

Climate risk disclosure could lead to unintended consequences, such as investors downgrading other risks which might have similar financial impacts but do not have to be disclosed in the same way, the research said.

"The task force's proposals are useful in terms of heightening the discussion around climate risk but eight decades of understanding of the materiality concept would be changed by this initiative," Daniel Yergin, IHS Markit vice chairman and co-author of the report, told Reuters.

"The use of scenarios and metrics is misleading; there are issues around confidentiality and why should we single out just one risk?"

IHS Markit said its report was financed by oil firms BP , Chevron , ConocoPhillips and Total , which are in one of the sectors most exposed to climate-related financial impacts, but its conclusions were its own.

Proposals for disclosing the financial impact of long-term scenarios and using metrics to quantify climate risk could be misleading, the report said.

Not only are scenarios based on a large number of assumptions, the assumptions will vary according to different companies and sources and are not comparable, IHS Markit added.

A TCFD recommendation that oil and gas firms disclose information related to the cost of supply for current and future projects could undermine their competitive positions. Such costs change constantly due to market and technology changes.

Companies could also face potential litigation if their future costs do not match the projected costs in their disclosures, the report said.

After a public consultation, the TCFD is expected to bring its final recommendations to the G20 at its meeting in Germany in July. The TCFD has 32 members from large banks, insurance companies, asset management companies, pension funds, credit rating agencies and accounting and consulting firms.

Jones Act tanker used to transport oil from Alaska's North Slope to retire -operator - 路透新闻

{{20170508T214541.047+0000}}Jones Act tanker used to transport oil from Alaska's North Slope to retire -operatorHOUSTON, May 8 (Reuters) - The Alaskan Frontier, a Suezmax tanker typically used to transport Alaskan North Slope crude to West Coast refineries, is scheduled to retire, according to vessel operator Alaska Tanker Company.

The U.S.-flagged vessel is one of a few that comply with the Jones Act, a maritime law that requires shipments between U.S. ports to take place on U.S.-built and manned vessels.

A source, who requested anonymity, said the ship would be retired in June, but the company did not confirm the timing.

The Alaska Tanker Company fleet is time chartered to transport BP Plc's Alaska North Slope production. The fleet operator has also moved Alaskan crude for producers Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips .

BHP Billiton under pressure to sell shale, even as oil prices fall - 路透新闻

{{20170505T074000.881+0000}}BHP Billiton under pressure to sell shale, even as oil prices fallBy Sonali Paul

MELBOURNE, May 5 (Reuters) - BHP Billiton is facing pressure from two activist shareholders over its $20 billion splurge on U.S. shale oil and gas fields, but may resist calls to dump the business just as oil prices are sliding.

Investors grumble that while BHP Billiton is a good operator in deepwater oil and gas, its shale business, first acquired in 2011, has been a capital drain and shareholders would be better off with a sale. But now may not be the right time.

BHP says it sees petroleum as a core business, including most of the shale operations.

"The risk is doing it for the wrong reasons - because people are telling you do it - and getting out quickly. We're at $40 oil. It's not necessarily the greatest time to be contemplating that," said Brenton Saunders, an analyst at BT Investment Management, which owns BHP shares.

Australian boutique manager Tribeca Partners estimated BHP could fetch $10 billion for its shale assets, based on recent deals done in the Permian and Eagle Ford shale regions that implied prices of $30,000 to $40,000 per net acre.

However BHP has said it wants to hold on to its Permian acreage, where it has been consolidating its position by picking up high grade acreage and is looking to trade acreage or work with companies with adjoining acreage to boost production.

It has also highlighted its success in slashing costs by 64 percent in the Black Hawk region over the past four years.

"On many measures we're one of, if not the, lowest-cost operator," BHP CEO Andrew Mackenzie told investors in April, defending its rejection of a proposal by fund manager Elliott Management for the company to spin off its U.S. oil and gas assets.

BHP can take comfort in kudos from energy consultants Wood Mackenzie, which said the company has among the lowest breakeven costs among shale operators in one of the richest parts of the Permian Basin, $30.20 a barrel.

"BHP is active in the swap market, and we expect its operational success to open doors with swap and strategic partners," Wood Mackenzie said in a report, referring to the market for trading acreage with other operators.

Its less attractive Fayetteville acreage, valued at $919 million on its books at the end of 2016, is back up for sale. [nL4N1HY1CF]

BT's Saunders said one way BHP could divest shale while retaining exposure to a potential recovery in oil prices would be to vend the shale assets to a well-regarded shale operator in return for an equity stake in that company, which it could sell down the track.

Other operators active in areas where BHP holds acreage include ConocoPhillips , EOG Resources Inc , Anadarko Petroleum , and Marathon Oil Corp .

UPDATE 2-ConocoPhillips to lay off 300 in Canada oil sands pullback - 路透新闻

{{20170504T224020.737+0000}}UPDATE 2-ConocoPhillips to lay off 300 in Canada oil sands pullback(Adds comment from government on internal briefing note)

By Ethan Lou

CALGARY, Alberta, May 4 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips will lay off 300 Canadian workers after selling most local assets to domestic crude producer Cenovus Energy Inc , the Houston-based company said on Thursday.

ConocoPhillips in March agreed to sell oil sands and western natural gas assets to Cenovus for C$17 billion ($12.4 billion), making it the latest international oil major to pull back from a region beset by high costs and low crude prices. [nL2N1H7108]

Norwegian oil company Statoil ASA , which late last year agreed to sell Canadian oil sands assets to local producer Athabasca Oil Corp , has also shed staff, a spokesman said on Thursday, without disclosing the precise number.

The resulting layoffs will pile on to the high unemployment rate facing oil-producing Alberta province after the two-year crash in commodity prices. The unemployment rate was 8.4 percent in March, slightly down from months earlier, but still at a level not seen in more than 20 years.

The government of Alberta has been publicly firm that the asset sales are good news as buyers have been domestic companies eyeing expansion. But privately, in written advice to Energy Minister Marg McCuaig-Boyd days after the Cenovus deal, a senior civil servant conceded one negative aspect in the "financial and labour impact" of the exodus.

"Some energy jobs may be at risk because such mergers and acquisitions yield duplications and redundancies," according to the government briefing note, seen by Reuters under freedom-of-information laws.

Asked about the note, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said job losses are a cost of consolidation, although she does "not necessarily" anticipate more layoffs. The province is working hard to seek export markets for its landlocked energy products to ensure the sector's long-term stability, she said.

ConocoPhillips spokesman Rob Evans said the layoffs will be mostly in the Canada's oil capital of Calgary, Alberta, and will occur by mid-May. The company had more than 2,000 staff in Canada as of late 2015.

Global energy majors have sold off more than $22.5 billion worth of Canadian oil sands assets so far this year to domestic companies. [nL1N1HZ2GV]

Royal Dutch Shell , which in March agreed to sell most oil sands assets for $8.5 billion to Canadian Natural Resources , said at the time that layoffs among head office employees and technical staff were possible.

Shell spokeswoman Tara Lemay on Thursday declined to provide a precise figure, saying most workers will be kept on and those laid off are eligible to apply for positions within Shell globally.

Jones Act tanker used to transport oil from Alaska's North Slope to retire -operator - 路透新闻

{{20170508T214541.047+0000}}Jones Act tanker used to transport oil from Alaska's North Slope to retire -operatorHOUSTON, May 8 (Reuters) - The Alaskan Frontier, a Suezmax tanker typically used to transport Alaskan North Slope crude to West Coast refineries, is scheduled to retire, according to vessel operator Alaska Tanker Company.

The U.S.-flagged vessel is one of a few that comply with the Jones Act, a maritime law that requires shipments between U.S. ports to take place on U.S.-built and manned vessels.

A source, who requested anonymity, said the ship would be retired in June, but the company did not confirm the timing.

The Alaska Tanker Company fleet is time chartered to transport BP Plc's Alaska North Slope production. The fleet operator has also moved Alaskan crude for producers Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips .

BHP Billiton under pressure to sell shale, even as oil prices fall - 路透新闻

{{20170505T074000.881+0000}}BHP Billiton under pressure to sell shale, even as oil prices fallBy Sonali Paul

MELBOURNE, May 5 (Reuters) - BHP Billiton is facing pressure from two activist shareholders over its $20 billion splurge on U.S. shale oil and gas fields, but may resist calls to dump the business just as oil prices are sliding.

Investors grumble that while BHP Billiton is a good operator in deepwater oil and gas, its shale business, first acquired in 2011, has been a capital drain and shareholders would be better off with a sale. But now may not be the right time.

BHP says it sees petroleum as a core business, including most of the shale operations.

"The risk is doing it for the wrong reasons - because people are telling you do it - and getting out quickly. We're at $40 oil. It's not necessarily the greatest time to be contemplating that," said Brenton Saunders, an analyst at BT Investment Management, which owns BHP shares.

Australian boutique manager Tribeca Partners estimated BHP could fetch $10 billion for its shale assets, based on recent deals done in the Permian and Eagle Ford shale regions that implied prices of $30,000 to $40,000 per net acre.

However BHP has said it wants to hold on to its Permian acreage, where it has been consolidating its position by picking up high grade acreage and is looking to trade acreage or work with companies with adjoining acreage to boost production.

It has also highlighted its success in slashing costs by 64 percent in the Black Hawk region over the past four years.

"On many measures we're one of, if not the, lowest-cost operator," BHP CEO Andrew Mackenzie told investors in April, defending its rejection of a proposal by fund manager Elliott Management for the company to spin off its U.S. oil and gas assets.

BHP can take comfort in kudos from energy consultants Wood Mackenzie, which said the company has among the lowest breakeven costs among shale operators in one of the richest parts of the Permian Basin, $30.20 a barrel.

"BHP is active in the swap market, and we expect its operational success to open doors with swap and strategic partners," Wood Mackenzie said in a report, referring to the market for trading acreage with other operators.

Its less attractive Fayetteville acreage, valued at $919 million on its books at the end of 2016, is back up for sale. [nL4N1HY1CF]

BT's Saunders said one way BHP could divest shale while retaining exposure to a potential recovery in oil prices would be to vend the shale assets to a well-regarded shale operator in return for an equity stake in that company, which it could sell down the track.

Other operators active in areas where BHP holds acreage include ConocoPhillips , EOG Resources Inc , Anadarko Petroleum , and Marathon Oil Corp .

UPDATE 2-ConocoPhillips to lay off 300 in Canada oil sands pullback - 路透新闻

{{20170504T224020.737+0000}}UPDATE 2-ConocoPhillips to lay off 300 in Canada oil sands pullback(Adds comment from government on internal briefing note)

By Ethan Lou

CALGARY, Alberta, May 4 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips will lay off 300 Canadian workers after selling most local assets to domestic crude producer Cenovus Energy Inc , the Houston-based company said on Thursday.

ConocoPhillips in March agreed to sell oil sands and western natural gas assets to Cenovus for C$17 billion ($12.4 billion), making it the latest international oil major to pull back from a region beset by high costs and low crude prices. [nL2N1H7108]

Norwegian oil company Statoil ASA , which late last year agreed to sell Canadian oil sands assets to local producer Athabasca Oil Corp , has also shed staff, a spokesman said on Thursday, without disclosing the precise number.

The resulting layoffs will pile on to the high unemployment rate facing oil-producing Alberta province after the two-year crash in commodity prices. The unemployment rate was 8.4 percent in March, slightly down from months earlier, but still at a level not seen in more than 20 years.

The government of Alberta has been publicly firm that the asset sales are good news as buyers have been domestic companies eyeing expansion. But privately, in written advice to Energy Minister Marg McCuaig-Boyd days after the Cenovus deal, a senior civil servant conceded one negative aspect in the "financial and labour impact" of the exodus.

"Some energy jobs may be at risk because such mergers and acquisitions yield duplications and redundancies," according to the government briefing note, seen by Reuters under freedom-of-information laws.

Asked about the note, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said job losses are a cost of consolidation, although she does "not necessarily" anticipate more layoffs. The province is working hard to seek export markets for its landlocked energy products to ensure the sector's long-term stability, she said.

ConocoPhillips spokesman Rob Evans said the layoffs will be mostly in the Canada's oil capital of Calgary, Alberta, and will occur by mid-May. The company had more than 2,000 staff in Canada as of late 2015.

Global energy majors have sold off more than $22.5 billion worth of Canadian oil sands assets so far this year to domestic companies. [nL1N1HZ2GV]

Royal Dutch Shell , which in March agreed to sell most oil sands assets for $8.5 billion to Canadian Natural Resources , said at the time that layoffs among head office employees and technical staff were possible.

Shell spokeswoman Tara Lemay on Thursday declined to provide a precise figure, saying most workers will be kept on and those laid off are eligible to apply for positions within Shell globally.

ConocoPhillips to lay off 300 in Canada after Cenovus deal - 路透新闻

{{20170504T154158.478+0000}}ConocoPhillips to lay off 300 in Canada after Cenovus dealCALGARY, Alberta, May 4 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips will lay off 300 Canadian workers, mostly in the country's oil capital of Calgary, after selling most of its local assets to local producer Cenovus Energy Inc , the Houston-based company said on Thursday.

The layoffs will occur by the middle of May, ConocoPhillips spokesman Rob Evans said.

TABLE-First Bakken oil cargo to Asia exported - 路透新闻

{{20170502T205217.066+0000}}TABLE-First Bakken oil cargo to Asia exportedMay 2 (Reuters) - The first-ever reported export of North Dakota's crude oil to Asia left port last month,
according to documents seen by Reuters.

Swiss-based Mercuria Energy Trading S.A. loaded more than 600,000 barrels of Bakken crude, as well as some Mars
Sour crude and DSW crude, in late March off the coast of Louisiana onto the very large crude carrier (VLCC) Maran
Canopus, destined for Singapore, according to the bill of lading and ship tracking data.

The Maran Canopus supertanker took oil in a ship-to-ship transfer from smaller Aframax vessels on five
different occasions, according to the data.

At least two Asian refiners told Reuters they are interested in Bakken light crude because of the products it
can yield through refining.

For the first three quarters of 2016 exports, see: [nL1N1EZ155]

By Gary McWilliams

HOUSTON, May 2 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips reported a surprise quarterly loss on Tuesday as operating costs came in higher than expected, sending its shares lower in afternoon trading.

However, the largest U.S. independent oil producer's results reflected a slow but steady improvement across the industry bolstered by improved pricing for its oil and natural gas. Crude prices are up more than 50 percent from a year ago.

Don Wallette Jr., chief financial officer, said the latest quarter included a $200 million loss from a currency hedge tied to the British pound and a benefit of about $100 million from a tax loss carry forward.

The company expects to complete the sale of some Canadian oil sands and natural gas properties this quarter, and will finish a planned $3 billion share buyback by year end, he said in a conference call.

The Houston-based company said its total realized price was $36.18 per barrel of oil equivalent in the first quarter, compared with $22.94 a year earlier. [nL1N1I40L4]

ConocoPhillips's production, excluding Libya, inched up 2 percent to 1.584 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the latest quarter. [nBw9bbtMja]

That was higher than Wall Street expectations of 1.571 million boepd.

"Production was above guidance, but this was outweighed by higher costs," Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov said.

The company's operating expenses of $1.30 billion were higher than Raymond James' estimate of $1.24 billion, Molchanov said. Exploration expenses of $258 million on a pre-tax basis were also much larger than the $70 million Barclays analysts had estimated.

ConocoPhillips said it expects production of between 1.495 million and 1.535 million boepd for the current quarter, excluding any output from Libya. The estimate does not reflect the impact of recently announced asset sales.

The oil producer said last month it would sell natural gas-heavy assets in San Juan basin to privately held Hilcorp Energy Co for about $3 billion and earlier agreed to sell oil sands and western Canadian natural gas assets to Cenovus Energy Inc for C$17.7 billion.

ConocoPhillips has also marked other gas-weighted assets for sale, including some assets in the Anadarko basin, the Barnett shale field, and the Gulf of Mexico.

Net profit was $800 million, or 62 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a net loss of $1.5 billion, or $1.18 per share, a year earlier.

Excluding a gain on the sale of assets in Canada, the company posted a loss of 2 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 1 cent per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

What to Watch in the Day Ahead - Tuesday, May 2 - 路透新闻

{{20170501T192631.910+0000}}What to Watch in the Day Ahead - Tuesday, May 2(The Day Ahead is an email and PDF publication that includes the day's major stories and events, analyses and other features. To receive The Day Ahead, Eikon users can register at [DAY/US]. Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT)

Apple Inc is expected to post its second straight quarter of revenue growth, buoyed by sales of its high-end smartphones, particularly the iPhone 7 Plus. Analysts will be keeping an eye on Apple's typically conservative June-quarter forecast, which takes into account the lull in spending just before the company launches its latest phone. When company reports its second-quarter results, investors will also be expecting it to increase its buyback program and dividends.

The Federal Open Market Committee begins a two-day meeting on interest rate policy. The central bank is widely expected to hold interest rates steady. Investors are instead focused on the language of the Fed statement for guidance on the number of interest rates hikes this year and next.

After a great run of rising vehicle sales, investors and analysts are keenly watching to see whether the wheels are coming off the auto industry's present, record-setting boom cycle. Sales in March came in at a disappointing level, raising concerns over a downturn. Analysts polled by Reuters on average expected April sales to hit a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 17.2 million units. (1530/1930)

Mastercard Inc, the world's No. 2 payments network, is expected to report a rise in revenue and profit, helped by higher purchase volumes. When the company will report its first-quarter results, investors would be interested in any guidance on the year ahead, including that on expenses as the company has been focusing on digital growth.

Pfizer Inc is expected to post weaker revenue as part of its first-quarter results, as the drugmaker's portfolio groans under the weight of looming patent expirations, as well as those that have already begun to chip away at sales. After deciding against splitting itself up last year, there will be considerable focus on Pfizer's traditionally vociferous appetite for M&A as it looks to strengthen its ship, with chatter about Bristol-Myers Squibb as a potential target doing the rounds. Separately, Gilead Sciences Inc, maker of HIV and hepatitis treatments, also reports first-quarter earnings.

Merck & Co Inc releases its first-quarter earnings. With the next frontier in cancer immunotherapy within reach, investors will be laser focused on the performance of Merck's Keytruda after Bristol-Myers reported strong quarterly growth for rival drug Opdivo last week. Considered Merck's most significant growth driver, Wall Street is hoping for signs that Keytruda and other drugs in the company's pipeline will be enough to offset patent expirations on many key products.

Aetna Inc, the third largest health insurer, reports first-quarter earnings. Investors will watch out for comments about the health insurer's plans on Obamacare market.

HCA Holdings Inc, the largest for-profit hospital operator reports first-quarter results. HCA, which preannounced part of its results, is expected to report soft volumes due to weak hospital operating environment. Investors will watch out for comments on the likely impact of President Donald Trump and Republicans' plan to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system on hospital operators.

CVS Health Corp reports its first-quarter results. The drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) lowered its full-year PBM unit revenue growth forecast, which analysts partly attributed to branded drug price increases coming in lower than anticipated. Traffic in its stores is also expected to have been weak in the quarter.

Cable company Charter Communications Inc is expected to report a rise in its quarterly revenue, helped by the growth of its residential customers. Last month, the company said it will develop and produce original programming with AMC Networks, which is known for the show "The Walking Dead," to differentiate its content offerings.

Fertilizer maker Mosaic Co is expected to post a bigger quarterly profit year over year, as potash prices modestly rebound. When the company will release its first-quarter results, investors will be interested in any updates on its acquisition of Vale SA's fertilizer assets.

Agricultural trader Archer Daniels Midland Co reports first-quarter earnings amid abundant global grain stocks that have lowered costs for the raw materials it processes into vegetable oil, corn sweetener and ethanol. But the plentiful crop supplies have also squeezed trading margins and the company has been shedding traders around the world.

The maker of Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolates, Mondelez International Inc's first-quarter profit is likely to beat estimates, helped by cost cuts through its zero-based budgeting plan. Investors will look forward to the company's 2017 profit forecast to know the efficacy of its cost-cutting plan.

Devon Energy Corp, the oil and gas producer, is expected to report a quarterly profit, compared with a year-ago loss, as rising oil prices boost cash flows. Meanwhile, Anadarko Petroleum Corp is expected to post a smaller quarterly loss, buoyed by the rise in oil prices. When the companies release their first-quarter results, investors will seek details of their drilling plans for the year.

ConocoPhillips, the largest independent oil company in the United States, is expected to swing to a quarterly profit, helped by a rise in oil prices. During the company's first-quarter results, investors will seek details of the company's plans to sell assets worth C$17 billion to Cenovus Energy.

Engine maker Cummins Inc is expected to report lower profit and revenue for the first quarter, due to weak heavy-duty truck production in North America and poor global demand for power generation equipment. Investors will look for an update on full-year financial forecast.

Emerson Electric Co, the factory automation equipment maker, is expected to report lower revenue and profit for the second quarter, partly due to slow demand in the oil and gas industry. The company is seeing rising demand for its air conditioning and refrigeration components in China, one of its biggest markets outside the United States. Investors will look for an update on the company's fiscal year 2017 financial forecast.

Akamai Technologies Inc, the online content distributor, is expected to report a rise in first-quarter revenue, driven by strong demand for its security services. However, Akamai has been experiencing continued slowdown in its media delivery business after some of its large customers shifted to their own delivery networks, and this could hurt the company's future revenue.

FireEye Inc is expected to report its second straight fall in revenue during its first quarter. The cyber security company has been struggling to regain momentum in a highly competitive market and is also coping with a string of executive departures. FireEye is also shifting to a subscription-based revenue model, which is expected to lead to more stable revenue streams in the future.

Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc, the owner of the Waldorf Astoria hotel chain, is expected to report higher revenue per available room for the first quarter, helped by an increase in corporate transient demand post-election. Investors will look for an update on the company's fiscal year 2017 financial forecast.

First Solar Inc is expected to report a loss for the first quarter, compared with a year-ago profit, as it transitions to a new product ahead of schedule. Analysts and investors will look for comments on panel pricing and demand.

Coach Inc, which is expected to report a dip in sales for the third quarter, has been battling rising competition and increased discounting. The handbag maker, in a push to regain its premium tag, has tightened inventory and cut back on promotions in North America.

Canadian gold miner Kinross Gold Corp is expected to report flat first-quarter earnings, which is likely to include a gain from the recent sale of its stake in the Cerro Casale project in Chile. Investors are likely to focus on the potential sale of its Chilean assets and whether the company is leaning toward going ahead with the second phase of its Tasiast mine expansion in Mauritania.

Canada's No. 2 oil and natural gas producer, Encana Corp, is expected to swing to a quarterly profit, helped by the rise in oil prices. During the company's release of first-quarter results, investors will look for details of its drilling plans for the year.

WestJet Airlines Ltd, Canada's second-largest carrier, is expected to report a smaller loss for the first quarter, as it flew more passengers and cut costs. Investors and analysts will seek an update on the company's recently announced plan to launch an ultra low-cost airline.

Canadian e-commerce software maker Shopify Inc is expected to post a bigger loss in the first quarter, hurt by higher costs. Investors will look for details of the company's plans to grow its customer base.

Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc holds its annual general meeting as investors await an update on efforts to sell assets and repay a heavy debt load.

The chief executive of United Airlines Inc, Oscar Munoz, will testify before a House panel in the aftermath of the forced removal on April 9 of a passenger from a Chicago flight. He will be joined by other airline executives and the company's president.

The House Financial Services Committee will consider amendments and vote on the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017. The legislation would repeal large parts of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, and place new restrictions on regulators. Representative Jeb Hensarling, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee and has authored a broad reworking of financial rules, speaks with the Independent Community Bankers of America at their policy conference in Washington.

Mexico's Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data will be released for April, the month after factory activity rose to its highest level this year. (1030/1430) Markit PMI data for Brazil is also scheduled to be released for April. (0900/1300) Meanwhile, Brazil is expected to post a trade surplus of $7.10 billion in April. (1400/1900)
