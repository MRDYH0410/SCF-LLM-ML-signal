{{20171227T194316.245+0000}}US STOCKS-Wall Street little changed as tech offsets energyNEW YORK, Dec 27 (Reuters)

* Oil prices retreat from 2015 highs

* Tesla down on KeyBanc's lowered estimate for Model 3 deliveries

* Dow up 0.06 pct, S&P 500 up 0.01 pct, Nasdaq up 0.01 pct

(Updates to mid-afternoon, changes byline)

By Chuck Mikolajczak

NEW YORK, Dec 27 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were little changed on Wednesday, as gains in the technology sector offset losses in energy and helped keep major indexes nearly flat.

The S&P technology index <.SPLRCT> was up 0.1 percent and poised to snap a five-session losing streak, its longest since April, led by gains in Facebook , up 1.0 percent, and Visa , up 0.8 percent.

Trading volumes remained muted in the holiday-shortened week between Christmas and New Year. Trading on Tuesday marked the thinnest volume of the year for a full session.

"We don't see the behaviors typical of theme changes so we think this messiness in December is just temporary; the leadership of the year will resume and continue into 2018," said Craig Callahan, President of ICON Funds in Denver.

"Technology, for example, led but we don't see them as overpriced."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> rose 15.81 points, or 0.06 percent, to 24,762.02, the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 0.18 point, or 0.01 percent, to 2,680.68 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 0.64 point, or 0.01 percent, to 6,936.89.

Oil prices dipped after hitting a near two-and-a-half-year high in the previous session, pushing down the S&P energy index <.SPNY> by 0.4 percent. [nL4N1OR1BW]

ConocoPhillips , off 1.6 percent and Chevron down 0.4 were the biggest drags on the index.

Housing stocks <.HGX> edged up 0.1 percent after data showed contracts to buy previously owned homes edged higher in November, the latest signal the housing market may have regained some momentum. [nL1N1OR0IA]

Tesla shares fell 1.7 percent after brokerage KeyBanc lowered its estimate for Model 3 deliveries to roughly 5,000 units from 15,000 units for the fourth quarter. [nFWN1OM0J6]

Shares of wireless-charging technology developer Energous Corp surged 107 percent to $18.30 after it got certification for its wireless charging transmitter. [nL4N1OR2UH]

Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.16-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.09-to-1 ratio favored advancers.

The S&P 500 posted 27 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 76 new highs and 14 new lows.

BREAKINGVIEWS-Big Oil's discipline reinforces shale's swing role - 路透新闻

{{20171222T145946.000+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Big Oil's discipline reinforces shale's swing roleDALLAS, Dec 22 (Reuters Breakingviews)

(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Lauren Silva Laughlin

DALLAS, Dec 22 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Big Oil is going to be disciplined in 2018. That doesn't necessarily mean less production, but it does mean going for cheaper, faster projects first. That only helps U.S. shale – and means more frustration for oil-producing countries that would like to see a higher price.

ConocoPhillips is one U.S. producer that has explicitly discussed a measured approach to future spending. In November, Chief Executive Ryan Lance told Reuters the company would limit production spending to $5.5 billion per year over the next three years, and it wouldn't invest in projects that required oil above $50 a barrel to make a profit. It's a common theme. Exxon Mobil , Occidental Petroleum , Royal Dutch Shell and their peers are all under pressure from shareholders to prove they can make money throughout the cycle.

Expensive, longer-term projects will be constrained as a result, while U.S. shale, among the fastest and least costly sources of oil in the world, will fill in the gap. In 2017, U.S. tight oil, as shale is also known, solidified its place as the market's swing producer even as OPEC, the oil world's dominant cartel, cut production. The International Energy Agency says that though the number of active U.S. rigs fell in 2017, output will continue to rise in 2018.

In the nearer term, OPEC's decision to extend its curbs on production until the end of 2018 will help keep a floor under prices. But shale's contributions will keep a lid on them. The U.S. Energy Information Administration sees oil hovering at $53 a barrel, with the International Monetary Fund's estimate slightly lower. Aiming for profit might keep some disciplined. But analysts expect returns on capital for the most focused tight-oil drillers to shoot up as a result of the higher prices wrought by OPEC. And $50 a barrel is plenty high enough for drillers in the Midland Basin in West Texas, who can cover their operating expenses at half that.

Unless new discoveries or technologies upend the energy sector, shale's influence will grow. The IEA says U.S. shale output in the 15 years to 2025 will match the highest sustained period of oil output growth by any single country in the history of the oil markets. By then the United States will be the largest liquefied natural gas exporter and, shortly after, a net exporter of oil. Shale has the power to keep oil prices subdued for a long time yet.

CONTEXT NEWS

- On Nov. 30, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers led by Russia agreed to extend oil output cuts until the end of 2018. The cartel also decided to cap the combined output of Nigeria and Libya at 2017 levels of less than 2.8 million barrels a day. Both countries had previously been exempt from production restraints.

- By October, commercial inventories in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development had fallen to a level 140 million barrels above the five-year moving average, draining more than half the previous glut, according to OPEC.

Alaska oil companies settle dispute over Trans-Alaska Pipeline tariff charges - 路透新闻

{{20171216T025505.000+0000}}Alaska oil companies settle dispute over Trans-Alaska Pipeline tariff chargesANCHORAGE, Alaska, Dec 15 (Reuters)

ANCHORAGE, Alaska, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The state of Alaska will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in a settlement with oil companies over the value of North Slope crude oil shipped through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline (TAP), officials announced.

The settlement between Alaska and the companies that own the 800-mile oil artery concerns transportation tariffs charged by the pipeline owners between 2009 and 2015.

Alaska claimed that the Alyeska owner companies, including BP, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Koch Industries and Unocal, overstated the tariffs and improperly devalued the oil delivered by the pipeline, thus reducing state income.

"This settlement is a great result for the State," Alaska Attorney General Jahna Lindemuth said in statement. "It creates certainty going forward, avoids future litigation, and will provide additional taxes and royalties -- bringing needed money to the state treasury."

The settlement was filed Friday with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Regulatory Commission of Alaska (RCA), said Chief Alaska Attorney General John Ptacin. It is subject to FERC and RCA approval, which state officials hope will happen by next spring, he said.

The settlement resolves multiple disputes over the time period. "There's about 40 rate cases. We're settling all of those cases in this settlement agreement," Ptacin said.

The terms allow the state to retain $224 million in already collected revenues and grant the state an additional $165 million in oil revenues.

Other terms require the companies to exclude from any tariff calculations approximately $625 million that the owner companies spent on "strategic reconfiguration" for TAPS operator Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. Terms also include a methodology for calculating transportation tariffs through 2021.

The settlement resolves complaints the oil companies filed in Washington, D.C. and Alaska courts that challenged past FERC and RCA rulings, Ptacin said.

Much of the disagreement stemmed from Alyeska's strategic reconfiguration project, which was aimed at streamlining operations, increasing automation and reducing costs in a time when the pipeline is carrying reduced oil volumes.

The state argued that the owner companies botched the project and added costs that should not be used to reduce the value of North Slope crude or the revenues derived from that crude. The state prevailed on that point, Ptacin said.

Disputes also concerned property taxes and how they would be treated in the tariff calculations, he said.

Also parties to the settlement are Anadarko, Tesoro, Flint Hills and Petro Star Inc., which shipped oil through the pipeline but held no ownership shares. Those companies generally sided with the state in the tariff disputes, Ptacin said.

ANALYSIS-Venezuelan creditors eyeing Citgo assets face uphill battle - 路透新闻

{{20171215T221507.573+0000}}ANALYSIS-Venezuelan creditors eyeing Citgo assets face uphill battleWILMINGTON, Del., Dec 14 (Reuters)

WILMINGTON, Del., Dec 14 (Reuters) - Citgo Petroleum may
look like a tempting target for bondholders of its parent
company, Venezuelan-owned oil driller PDVSA, but the refinery
operator's complex debt structure could make its assets
difficult for creditors to seize, legal experts said.

As Venezuela careens closer to a default, some holders of
PDVSA bonds set to expire in 2020 and backed by a pledge of
Citgo stock are preparing to go to U.S. courts to foreclose on
Citgo shares, according to sources familiar with the situation.

That may not be easy. Energy producer ConocoPhillips Co
 has gone to court alleging the pledge of 50.1 percent of
Citgo stock is fraudulent, meaning the PDVSA bondholders will
have a tough time getting their hands on the stock.

"Lots and lots of claimants have been circling Venezuela and
PDVSA, so there is plenty of competition for every scant asset
crumb, which means we should expect challenges at every turn,"
said Anna Gelpern, a professor at Georgetown Law.

The battle over Houston-based Citgo, which was valued as
high as $10 billion during an aborted 2014 sale process,
illustrates the dearth of viable options for foreign creditors
trying to collect from Venezuela.

Venezuela's Maduro said in November he wanted to restructure
all foreign debt, which includes some $60 billion in outstanding
sovereign and PDVSA bonds. Private estimates put the total
foreign obligations at more than $120 billion owed to creditors
including Russia, China and oil service providers.

Negotiations with bondholders are almost impossible in the
face of U.S. sanctions and the country has been ruled in default
due to payment delays on some bonds, which for years have been a
favorite of investors for their sky-high yields. [nL1N1NM2FY].

Faced with mounting concern that Venezuela will not be able
to keep up the payments, some holders of around $3 billion worth
of the 2020 bonds are talking to lawyers and advisers about
initiating legal action to seize the Citgo stake.

Legal experts said they would face many hurdles, including
Citgo's issuance of billions of dollars of its own debt. Holders
of Citgo debt could cite change-of-control provisions to demand
immediate repayment if PDVSA's bondholders got their hands on
the Citgo stock, Deutsche Bank said last month in a note to
clients.

"We see significant valuation risk in CITGO once the
collateral collection process is triggered given potential legal
challenges and other complications," said the Nov. 27 note by
strategist Hongtao Jiang.

PDVSA bondholders would also have to contend with Russian
oil producer Rosneft, which has a lien on the remainder of
Citgo's stock. The lien, and the legal uncertainty hanging over
Rosneft from U.S. sanctions, could undercut demand for acquiring
Citgo if bondholders were to put it up for a sale, legal experts
said.

"FREE-FOR-ALL"

Bondholders will also have to compete with other creditors
who are gunning for Citgo.

"It will become a free-for-all," said Mark Weidemaier, a
professor at University of North Carolina School of Law.

One creditor of Venezuela, Crystallex International Corp, a
Canadian gold miner, has already asked a federal judge in
Delaware to void the stock pledge to the 2020 bondholders.

Crystallex says the pledge was a fraudulent transfer of
value from Citgo, which got nothing from the stock pledge, to
PDVSA. With such uncertainty hanging over the stock pledge, the
bondholders will struggle to get full value for Citgo if they
manage to foreclose on the shares, according to legal experts.

Crystallex has said in court papers it has reached an
undisclosed settlement, which requires Crystallex to stay or
withdraw its case in Delaware federal court once it begins
receiving payments from Venezuela, according to court records.

But ConocoPhillips Co  launched a similar action last
year in the same Delaware court that also takes aim at undoing
the stock pledge.

A trustee for Crystallex, which is operating in bankruptcy
after Venezuela seized its mining operations, and a spokesman
for ConocoPhillips declined to comment.

Finally, PDVSA could put Citgo's U.S. holding company into
U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which would prevent creditors from
seizing Citgo stock, the main asset of the holding company.

However, bankruptcy can be chaotic and unpredictable and it
would increase the risk that Citgo could wither during the
process - a risk to both PDVSA as well as bondholders.

Richard Langberg, an analyst with S&P Global Ratings who
follows Citgo, said the significant costs and uncertainty should
give any creditor pause about trying to collect against Citgo.

"On a scale of one to 10," he said of the degree of
difficulty, "it's a nine or a 10."

RPT-ANALYSIS-Venezuelan creditors eyeing Citgo assets face uphill battle - 路透新闻

{{20171215T144802.909+0000}}RPT-ANALYSIS-Venezuelan creditors eyeing Citgo assets face uphill battleWILMINGTON, Del., Dec 14 (Reuters)

(Repeats Thursday story with no changes to text)

By Tom Hals

WILMINGTON, Del., Dec 14 (Reuters) - Citgo Petroleum may
look like a tempting target for bondholders of its parent
company, Venezuelan-owned oil driller PDVSA, but the refinery
operator's complex debt structure could make its assets
difficult for creditors to seize, legal experts said.

As Venezuela careens closer to a default, some holders of
PDVSA bonds set to expire in 2020 and backed by a pledge of
Citgo stock are preparing to go to U.S. courts to foreclose on
Citgo shares, according to sources familiar with the situation.

That may not be easy. Energy producer ConocoPhillips Co
 has gone to court alleging the pledge of 50.1 percent of
Citgo stock is fraudulent, meaning the PDVSA bondholders will
have a tough time getting their hands on the stock.

"Lots and lots of claimants have been circling Venezuela and
PDVSA, so there is plenty of competition for every scant asset
crumb, which means we should expect challenges at every turn,"
said Anna Gelpern, a professor at Georgetown Law.

The battle over Houston-based Citgo, which was valued as
high as $10 billion during an aborted 2014 sale process,
illustrates the dearth of viable options for foreign creditors
trying to collect from Venezuela.

Venezuela's Maduro said in November he wanted to restructure
all foreign debt, which includes some $60 billion in outstanding
sovereign and PDVSA bonds. Private estimates put the total
foreign obligations at more than $120 billion owed to creditors
including Russia, China and oil service providers.

Negotiations with bondholders are almost impossible in the
face of U.S. sanctions and the country has been ruled in default
due to payment delays on some bonds, which for years have been a
favorite of investors for their sky-high yields. [nL1N1NM2FY].

Faced with mounting concern that Venezuela will not be able
to keep up the payments, some holders of around $3 billion worth
of the 2020 bonds are talking to lawyers and advisers about
initiating legal action to seize the Citgo stake.

Legal experts said they would face many hurdles, including
Citgo's issuance of billions of dollars of its own debt. Holders
of Citgo debt could cite change-of-control provisions to demand
immediate repayment if PDVSA's bondholders got their hands on
the Citgo stock, Deutsche Bank said last month in a note to
clients.

"We see significant valuation risk in CITGO once the
collateral collection process is triggered given potential legal
challenges and other complications," said the Nov. 27 note by
strategist Hongtao Jiang.

PDVSA bondholders would also have to contend with Russian
oil producer Rosneft, which has a lien on the remainder of
Citgo's stock. The lien, and the legal uncertainty hanging over
Rosneft from U.S. sanctions, could undercut demand for acquiring
Citgo if bondholders were to put it up for a sale, legal experts
said.

"FREE-FOR-ALL"

Bondholders will also have to compete with other creditors
who are gunning for Citgo.

"It will become a free-for-all," said Mark Weidemaier, a
professor at University of North Carolina School of Law.

One creditor of Venezuela, Crystallex International Corp, a
Canadian gold miner, has already asked a federal judge in
Delaware to void the stock pledge to the 2020 bondholders.

Crystallex says the pledge was a fraudulent transfer of
value from Citgo, which got nothing from the stock pledge, to
PDVSA. With such uncertainty hanging over the stock pledge, the
bondholders will struggle to get full value for Citgo if they
manage to foreclose on the shares, according to legal experts.

Crystallex has said in court papers it has reached an
undisclosed settlement, which requires Crystallex to stay or
withdraw its case in Delaware federal court once it begins
receiving payments from Venezuela, according to court records.

But ConocoPhillips Co  launched a similar action last
year in the same Delaware court that also takes aim at undoing
the stock pledge.

A trustee for Crystallex, which is operating in bankruptcy
after Venezuela seized its mining operations, and a spokesman
for ConocoPhillips declined to comment.

Finally, PDVSA could put Citgo's U.S. holding company into
U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which would prevent creditors from
seizing Citgo stock, the main asset of the holding company.

However, bankruptcy can be chaotic and unpredictable and it
would increase the risk that Citgo could wither during the
process - a risk to both PDVSA as well as bondholders.

Richard Langberg, an analyst with S&P Global Ratings who
follows Citgo, said the significant costs and uncertainty should
give any creditor pause about trying to collect against Citgo.

"On a scale of one to 10," he said of the degree of
difficulty, "it's a nine or a 10."

ANALYSIS-Venezuelan creditors eyeing Citgo assets face uphill battle - 路透新闻

{{20171214T223544.131+0000}}ANALYSIS-Venezuelan creditors eyeing Citgo assets face uphill battleWILMINGTON, Del., Dec 14 (Reuters)

By Tom Hals

WILMINGTON, Del., Dec 14 (Reuters) - Citgo Petroleum may
look like a tempting target for bondholders of its parent
company, Venezuelan-owned oil driller PDVSA, but the refinery
operator's complex debt structure could make its assets
difficult for creditors to seize, legal experts said.

As Venezuela careens closer to a default, some holders of
PDVSA bonds set to expire in 2020 and backed by a pledge of
Citgo stock are preparing to go to U.S. courts to foreclose on
Citgo shares, according to sources familiar with the situation.

That may not be easy. Energy producer ConocoPhillips Co
 has gone to court alleging the pledge of 50.1 percent of
Citgo stock is fraudulent, meaning the PDVSA bondholders will
have a tough time getting their hands on the stock.

"Lots and lots of claimants have been circling Venezuela and
PDVSA, so there is plenty of competition for every scant asset
crumb, which means we should expect challenges at every turn,"
said Anna Gelpern, a professor at Georgetown Law.

The battle over Houston-based Citgo, which was valued as
high as $10 billion during an aborted 2014 sale process,
illustrates the dearth of viable options for foreign creditors
trying to collect from Venezuela.

Venezuela's Maduro said in November he wanted to restructure
all foreign debt, which includes some $60 billion in outstanding
sovereign and PDVSA bonds. Private estimates put the total
foreign obligations at more than $120 billion owed to creditors
including Russia, China and oil service providers.

Negotiations with bondholders are almost impossible in the
face of U.S. sanctions and the country has been ruled in default
due to payment delays on some bonds, which for years have been a
favorite of investors for their sky-high yields. [nL1N1NM2FY].

Faced with mounting concern that Venezuela will not be able
to keep up the payments, some holders of around $3 billion worth
of the 2020 bonds are talking to lawyers and advisers about
initiating legal action to seize the Citgo stake.

Legal experts said they would face many hurdles, including
Citgo's issuance of billions of dollars of its own debt. Holders
of Citgo debt could cite change-of-control provisions to demand
immediate repayment if PDVSA's bondholders got their hands on
the Citgo stock, Deutsche Bank said last month in a note to
clients.

"We see significant valuation risk in CITGO once the
collateral collection process is triggered given potential legal
challenges and other complications," said the Nov. 27 note by
strategist Hongtao Jiang.

PDVSA bondholders would also have to contend with Russian
oil producer Rosneft, which has a lien on the remainder of
Citgo's stock. The lien, and the legal uncertainty hanging over
Rosneft from U.S. sanctions, could undercut demand for acquiring
Citgo if bondholders were to put it up for a sale, legal experts
said.

"FREE-FOR-ALL"

Bondholders will also have to compete with other creditors
who are gunning for Citgo.

"It will become a free-for-all," said Mark Weidemaier, a
professor at University of North Carolina School of Law.

One creditor of Venezuela, Crystallex International Corp, a
Canadian gold miner, has already asked a federal judge in
Delaware to void the stock pledge to the 2020 bondholders.

Crystallex says the pledge was a fraudulent transfer of
value from Citgo, which got nothing from the stock pledge, to
PDVSA. With such uncertainty hanging over the stock pledge, the
bondholders will struggle to get full value for Citgo if they
manage to foreclose on the shares, according to legal experts.

Crystallex has said in court papers it has reached an
undisclosed settlement, which requires Crystallex to stay or
withdraw its case in Delaware federal court once it begins
receiving payments from Venezuela, according to court records.

But ConocoPhillips Co  launched a similar action last
year in the same Delaware court that also takes aim at undoing
the stock pledge.

A trustee for Crystallex, which is operating in bankruptcy
after Venezuela seized its mining operations, and a spokesman
for ConocoPhillips declined to comment.

Finally, PDVSA could put Citgo's U.S. holding company into
U.S. Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which would prevent creditors from
seizing Citgo stock, the main asset of the holding company.

However, bankruptcy can be chaotic and unpredictable and it
would increase the risk that Citgo could wither during the
process - a risk to both PDVSA as well as bondholders.

Richard Langberg, an analyst with S&P Global Ratings who
follows Citgo, said the significant costs and uncertainty should
give any creditor pause about trying to collect against Citgo.

"On a scale of one to 10," he said of the degree of
difficulty, "it's a nine or a 10."

UPDATE 2-Cenovus Energy to axe more jobs during cost-cutting push - 路透新闻

{{20171214T192957.467+0000}}UPDATE 2-Cenovus Energy to axe more jobs during cost-cutting pushDec 14 (Reuters)

(Adds details on layoffs, analyst comment)

Dec 14 (Reuters) - Canadian oil sands company Cenovus Energy Inc said on Thursday it would cut an additional 15 percent of its workforce and lower operating expenses as new chief executive, Alex Pourbaix, seeks to aggressively reduce costs and lower debt.

The move was expected as Pourbaix last month vowed to focus on cost cuts as the company remains under investor pressure to justify its C$17 billion ($13.3 billion) deal to buy ConocoPhillips assets. [nL4N1N540C]

Calgary-based Cenovus, which hired Pourbaix last month, had said in June that it expected to eliminate some jobs, but did not specify the scale.

The company also said it expected to reduce per-barrel operating costs by 8 percent, compared with estimated 2017 expenses, and lower capital costs needed to sustain each oil barrel by 12 percent. [nL1N1JH160]

"Our priorities for 2018 are to reduce costs and deleverage our balance sheet," Pourbaix said in a statement.

Cenovus also cut spending in the Deep Basin gas assets it bought from ConocoPhillips, which had been unpopular in part because they departed from the Canadian company's oil sands focus.

Raymond James analyst Chris Cox said such moves were "consistent with the messaging" Pourbaix has provided.

"Tackling the cost structure and improving the balance sheet appear to be the hallmarks of the early strategy for new CEO," he said.

Cenovus also announced the departures of three top-level executives, which was also expected given that new CEOs typically shake up their management teams, said Desjardins analyst Justin Bouchard.

As of Nov. 15, Cenovus had raised just under C$4 billion out of a targeted C$4 billion to C$5 billion to pay down debt it took on to fund the ConocoPhillips deal.

Cenovus also said it expected to produce between 483,000 to 510,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018, an increase of 4-5 percent compared to 2017. [nGNXOJYVCa]

Cenovus shares were last down 1.3 percent at C$11.73 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, while the energy benchmark was down 0.2 percent. <.SPTTEN>

UPDATE 4-Broken pipeline cuts British supply during peak energy demand - 路透新闻

{{20171212T202402.949+0000}}UPDATE 4-Broken pipeline cuts British supply during peak energy demand* Oil and gas supplies disrupted during UK cold snap

* Forties is key oil flow for benchmark Brent prices

* Brent jumps above $65 for first time since mid-2015

(Updates with INEOS saying outage could last up to 4 weeks)

By Ron Bousso, Amanda Cooper and Alex Lawler

LONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Britain's biggest pipeline from its North Sea oil and gas fields is likely to be shut for several weeks for repairs, its operator said on Tuesday, disrupting gas flows and sending international crude prices to their highest since mid-2015.

The closure has struck during a winter freeze in Britain, where snow and ice have driven up demand for heating fuel just as gas flows through the network, which carries a third of Britain's gas produced offshore, were disrupted.

"We are working to get the pipeline restored to full operation as quickly as we can safely do so... We have previously indicated a time frame of three to four weeks and we believe it is no less than two," operator INEOS said in a email to customers seen by Reuters.

The pipeline, which carries about 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Forties crude, was shut after cracks were found.

It has particular significance to global markets because Forties is the largest out of the five crude oil streams that underpin the dated Brent benchmark, against which other crude prices are broadly based. Benchmark Brent crude prices rose above $65 per barrel for the first time since the middle of 2015 following the closure on Monday. [O/R]

INEOS only completed the purchase of the Forties pipeline system from oil major BP in October. A minor leak had caused a partial shutdown on Dec. 7 and a full shutdown on Monday. INEOS said the small crack has not increased over the past 24 hours.

Paul Wheelhouse, the Scottish energy minister, said there were no plans to shut the 200,000 bpd Grangemouth refinery, which uses Forties crude. [nL9N1NR00L]

"If it's a lengthy outage, then a recovery period for the fields will be long as well," the trading source said.

FIELDS CLOSING

A number of producers including BP , Shell and Chrysaor, said they had closed down oil fields in response.

The largest contributor to the Forties stream, the 180,000-bpd Buzzard oil field run by Nexen Petroleum UK Ltd, a subsidiary of China's CNOOC <0883.HK>, had also closed, two trading sources said. [CRU/OUT]

Monthly loading programmes show the supply of Forties is expected to reach 21 cargoes of 600,000 barrels each this month, equal to a daily supply rate of 406,000 bpd. [nL9N1AF03S]

The closure has created havoc with loading schedules in the North Sea, with one trading source saying cargo owners had been offered options to drop cargoes from the loading programme.

"At this point we would expect a large deferral list for the Forties loading programme to spill over into January," analysts from JBC Energy said in a note.

"The timing of the outage could not be much worse as winter weather is just materialising," Jefferies bank analysts wrote.

Jefferies estimated the closure resulted in production loss for BP of 105,000 bpd, for Total of 55,000 bpd, for Chevron of 45,000 bpd, for Exxon Mobil of 40,000, for Eni of 25,000 bpd, for Shell of 25,000 bpd, for ConocoPhillips of 15,000 bpd.

The Paris-based International Energy Agency, which advises Western governments and coordinates the release of oil from strategic stocks in the case of supply disruptions, said it stood ready to take action but it did not believe this was necessary for the time being.

"The market is amply supplied from other sources and stocks are well above the five-year average," the IEA said. [nL8N1OC4HN]

"The timing of the outage could not be much worse as winter weather is just materialising," Jefferies bank analysts wrote.

Jefferies estimated the closure resulted in production loss for BP of 105,000 bpd, for Total of 55,000 bpd, for Chevron of 45,000 bpd, for Exxon Mobil of 40,000, for Eni of 25,000 bpd, for Shell of 25,000 bpd, for ConocoPhillips of 15,000 bpd.

The Paris-based International Energy Agency, which advises Western governments and coordinates the release of oil from strategic stocks in the case of supply disruptions, said it stood ready to take action but it did not believe this was necessary for the time being.

"The market is amply supplied from other sources and stocks are well above the five-year average," the IEA said. [nL8N1OC4HN]

Alaskan oil lease sale brings few bids despite vast territory offered - 路透新闻

{{20171207T024228.435+0000}}Alaskan oil lease sale brings few bids despite vast territory offeredBy Yereth Rosen

ANCHORAGE, Alaska, Dec 6 (Reuters) - An oil-and-gas lease sale that raised concerns with environmentalists due to the vast amount of acres offered in Arctic Alaska drew few bids on Wednesday, government officials said.

Seven bids were received, covering about 80,000 acres - or less than 1 percent of the 10.3 million acres offered in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska by the Trump administration. It was, by far, more territory than ever offered in any of the previous 12 NPR-A lease sales held since 1999.

The sale was the latest move by the administration of President Donald Trump, a Republican, supporting his pledge to make the United States "energy dominant" by boosting output of oil, natural gas and coal.

Environmentalists have generally accepted some oil development in the National Petroleum Reserve but worry the Trump administration will lift too many restrictions. Environmentalists want to entirely block opening the state's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. [nL2N1MV01Z]

ConocoPhillips Alaska Inc, in partnership with Anadarko Petroleum Corp , submitted the seven bids, totaling $1.16 million, for tracts in the NPR-A. Results were revealed in a bid opening conducted in Anchorage by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management.

The ConocoPhillips-Anadarko bids were for tracts along the southern border of ConocoPhillips' Greater Mooses Tooth unit, where oil production is expected to start next year.

"Lease sale interest is unpredictable," Ted Murphy, associate director of the BLM's Alaska office, said in a telephone news conference after the sale. "We don't know what industry, ultimately, will be interested in getting from year to year."

Last year's NPR-A lease sale drew $18.8 million in bids, led by ConocoPhillips , for 67 tracts covering 613,529 acres.

One environmentalist said the results on Wednesday suggest that the Trump administration is overestimating industry's desire to drill new Arctic territory.

"It seems, from my perspective, that it's this mentality that if we open it, industry will come. And that's not necessarily true," said Lisa Baraff of the Fairbanks-based Northern Alaska Environmental Center.

Kara Moriarty, executive director of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association, said the low level of NPR-A bidding might show that companies were being strategic about new leases.

She noted that another lease sale for state land "right next door" to NPR-A drew brisk bidding. The Alaska Oil and Gas Division's lease sale, also held Wednesday, drew $19.9 million and over 100 bids, mostly from Spanish energy company Repsol SA and Colorado-based independent oil company Armstrong.

While U.S. Senate pushes Alaska wildlife refuge drilling, industry looks elsewhere - 路透新闻

{{20171205T200602.222+0000}}While U.S. Senate pushes Alaska wildlife refuge drilling, industry looks elsewhereBy Yereth Rosen

Dec 5 (Reuters) - Even as the U.S. Senate moves to allow oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), the real action is 150 miles (241 km) west, where industry proponents hope a coming sale of 10 million acres of land will revitalize the state's sagging crude production.

The Trump administration, through the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, will auction off 10 million acres on Wednesday in the National Petroleum Reserve (NPR-A), a hotbed of oil exploration and development in the western part of Alaska's North Slope.

The planned sale has encouraged the oil industry while angering environmental groups. It would be the largest amount of land offered in a single lease sale there. The last sale of 1.45 million acres in 2016 netted $18.8 million, according to the U.S. Interior Department.

Alaskan crude output this year was just 490,000 bpd, according to government data, far off its peak in 1988, when it produced more than 2 million barrels a day, nearly a quarter of overall U.S. production at the time.

Alaska's Congress members have pushed to allow drilling in ANWR, and a provision to do that was included in the Republican tax bill that recently passed the Senate.

Yet industry supporters say development in the NPR-A, already established for the oil and gas industry, could yield barrels much more quickly than drilling in more remote Alaska frontiers.

"NPR-A has the potential to fulfill short-term oil and gas needs for the state," said Kara Moriarty, executive director of the Alaska Oil and Gas Association.

"It's right next to currently producing fields," she said, rather than in the Arctic Ocean or the wilderness. She said that even if ANWR is opened to drilling, it would be 10 to 15 years before any oil could be produced there.

The NPR-A was set aside in 1923 as a source of oil for the military, but seven decades passed before there was any serious interest in drilling, and first production did not happen until 2015. Future development is held in check by a land management plan issued in 2013 that established five areas across the 23 million-acre reserve for special protection.

Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in May issued an order to review Arctic Alaska oil policies, with a potential repeal of environmental rules restricting NPR-A drilling.

The reserve holds an estimated 896 million barrels of recoverable oil and 52.8 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, according to a mean estimate issued by the U.S. Geological Survey in 2010, though the oil figure represents a sharp downward revision from 2002 estimates. In his May order, Zinke directed the USGS to revise that 2010 estimate.

ConocoPhillips Inc , the company most active in NPR-A, will ask the Bureau of Land Management to open up some territory near Teshekpuk Lake, Lisa Bruner, the company's Alaska vice president of North Slope operations and development, said at an industry conference last month in Anchorage.

Teshekpuk is the North Slope's biggest lake and site of protections that date to the Reagan administration.

"We see potential as we move into that area further to the west," Bruner said. ConocoPhillips plans to drill four exploration wells this winter on leases within NPR-A, and one on adjacent state land.

Environmentalists are chagrined at the pace of NPR-A development.

"We need to be talking about the North Slope overall, and the Arctic overall - the Arctic Refuge, the NPR-A and the Arctic Ocean – because the Trump administration wants to open it all," said Nicole Whittington-Evans, Alaska regional director of The Wilderness Society.

Federal law requires protection of ecological resources and Alaska Native cultural rights to hunting and fishing areas, along with oil development, Whittington-Evans said. The Obama-era management plan, the product of years of scientific and public review, accomplished those goals, she said.

UPDATE 2-Lacklustre drilling campaign cuts interest in Norwegian oil licensing round - 路透新闻

{{20171205T134250.081+0000}}UPDATE 2-Lacklustre drilling campaign cuts interest in Norwegian oil licensing round* 11 firms apply vs 26 firms in previous round

* Statoil, Lundin Petroleum, Aker BP among applicants

* Firms not applying: Chevron, Conoco, Lukoil, Tullow

OSLO, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Norway's attractiveness as an oil region took a hit on Tuesday when energy authorities said 11 oil firms applied for stakes in exploration blocks off Norway in its latest oil licensing round, less than half the number that applied in the previous round.

A disappointing drilling campaign this year in the Arctic Barents Sea - where oil companies did not make a single significant discovery - was the main factor discouraging oil companies from taking part in the 24th licencing round, industry experts said. [nL8N1MK1HD]

"Clearly the results of the exploration campaign in the Barents Sea this year have impacted the number of companies applying," said Helge Andre Martinsen, an analyst at DNB Markets.

"Overall exploration results this year have been extremely disappointing: dry wells and less volumes than expected," he added, citing in particular Statoil's Korpfjell prospect, for which expectations were high. [nL8N1LF1D4]

"The only thing that can turn this around is the upcoming Barents Sea campaign in 2018," he said.

Oil and gas are the Nordic country's largest industry, accounting for 12 percent of GDP. To replace existing output, new discoveries must be made and authorities expect them to be in the Barents Sea. After 2022, Norway has no major oil projects in the pipeline.

The number of firms applying for licences this year compares with 26 companies seeking drilling permits in the previous round in 2015. If all 11 applicants are awarded acreage, the 24th round would still be at a 15-year low in terms of participants. [nL8N1MK1HD]

Statoil, the largest explorer and producer off Norway, plans to drill five or six wells in the Barents Sea next year [nL8N1NY1MG]. Earlier on Tuesday it announced a $6 billion development plan for the Johan Castberg field in the Arctic. [nL8N1O50OW]

The oil and energy ministry said the latest licensing round is mainly about getting exploration going in key areas in Norway's least explored areas. Awards will be made in June 2018, it said in a statement.

In this licensing round, which focused on the Barents Sea, applicants included Statoil , Aker BP , Lundin Petroleum , Shell , OMV , Centrica , DEA and Wintershall .

Idemitsu <5019.T>, KUFPEC and RN Nordic Oil, a subsidiary of Rosneft , were also on the list of applicants.

Those that did not apply but applied in previous years included Chevron , ConocoPhillips , Lukoil , Tullow Oil and PGNiG .

The limited interest in the round does have a positive side for some of the firms taking part. "For Statoil, Aker BP and Lundin Petroleum, it is less competition," said Martinsen.

The government offered a total of 102 exploration blocks, consisting of 93 blocks in the Barents Sea and nine in the Norwegian Sea, although it is expected to narrow this down based on the interest expressed by oil firms.

UPDATE 2-Lacklustre drilling campaign cuts interest in Norwegian oil licensing round - 路透新闻

OSLO, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Norway's attractiveness as an oil region took a hit on Tuesday when energy authorities said 11 oil firms applied for stakes in exploration blocks off Norway in its latest oil licensing round, less than half the number that applied in the previous round.

A disappointing drilling campaign this year in the Arctic Barents Sea - where oil companies did not make a single significant discovery - was the main factor discouraging oil companies from taking part in the 24th licencing round, industry experts said. [nL8N1MK1HD]

"Clearly the results of the exploration campaign in the Barents Sea this year have impacted the number of companies applying," said Helge Andre Martinsen, an analyst at DNB Markets.

"Overall exploration results this year have been extremely disappointing: dry wells and less volumes than expected," he added, citing in particular Statoil's Korpfjell prospect, for which expectations were high. [nL8N1LF1D4]

"The only thing that can turn this around is the upcoming Barents Sea campaign in 2018," he said.

Oil and gas are the Nordic country's largest industry, accounting for 12 percent of GDP. To replace existing output, new discoveries must be made and authorities expect them to be in the Barents Sea. After 2022, Norway has no major oil projects in the pipeline.

The number of firms applying for licences this year compares with 26 companies seeking drilling permits in the previous round in 2015. If all 11 applicants are awarded acreage, the 24th round would still be at a 15-year low in terms of participants. [nL8N1MK1HD]

Statoil, the largest explorer and producer off Norway, plans to drill five or six wells in the Barents Sea next year [nL8N1NY1MG]. Earlier on Tuesday it announced a $6 billion development plan for the Johan Castberg field in the Arctic. [nL8N1O50OW]

The oil and energy ministry said the latest licensing round is mainly about getting exploration going in key areas in Norway's least explored areas. Awards will be made in June 2018, it said in a statement.

In this licensing round, which focused on the Barents Sea, applicants included Statoil , Aker BP , Lundin Petroleum , Shell , OMV , Centrica , DEA and Wintershall .

Idemitsu <5019.T>, KUFPEC and RN Nordic Oil, a subsidiary of Rosneft , were also on the list of applicants.

Those that did not apply but applied in previous years included Chevron , ConocoPhillips , Lukoil , Tullow Oil and PGNiG .

The limited interest in the round does have a positive side for some of the firms taking part. "For Statoil, Aker BP and Lundin Petroleum, it is less competition," said Martinsen.

The government offered a total of 102 exploration blocks, consisting of 93 blocks in the Barents Sea and nine in the Norwegian Sea, although it is expected to narrow this down based on the interest expressed by oil firms.

OSLO, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Some 11 oil firms applied for stakes in exploration blocks offshore Norway in its ongoing 24th oil and gas licensing round, which has a record number of blocks on offer in the Arctic Barents Sea, the country's Petroleum Directorate said on Tuesday.

By comparison, the 23rd round received applications from 26 firms.

Companies seeking to gain new acreage for oil and gas exploration off Norway include Statoil , Aker BP , Lundin Petroleum , Shell , OMV and Centrica .

UPDATE 1-ConocoPhillips to receive $337 million in accord with Ecuador - 路透新闻

{{20171204T152559.245+0000}}UPDATE 1-ConocoPhillips to receive $337 million in accord with Ecuador(Recasts to add context)

HOUSTON, Dec 4 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips will receive $337 million from Ecuador under a settlement of an arbitration case that the U.S. energy company brought over a 2009 confiscation of assets in the South American country.

A World Bank panel in February had ordered Ecuador to pay $380 million in damages to the oil and gas producer's subsidiary, Burlington Resources. The subsidiary had stakes in two blocks producing about 22,000 barrels of oil per day that were taken over by the government more than eight years ago. [nL4N1FU00G]

The settlement includes an offset for a decision awarding Ecuador $42 million on its environmental and infrastructure counterclaims. Burlington is entitled to $24 million through a third-party contribution to the payment, ConocoPhillips said on Monday

ConocoPhillips also said it was pleased to reach a conclusion of the matter. It received $75 million on Dec. 1 from Ecuador and expects to collect another $262 million by April 2018. [nBw24kcCfa]

In a statement, Ecuador's attorney general's office said, "The agreement between Ecuador and Burlington allows us to resolve this controversy and to reaffirm the Ecuadorean state's commitment to fulfilling its international obligations."

In 2012, the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes ruled Ecuador had unlawfully seized the investments and in February 2016 awarded damages. A stay of the award was lifted in August.
