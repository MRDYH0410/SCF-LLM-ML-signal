UPDATE 3-U.S. warns businesses of hacking campaign against nuclear, energy firms - 路透新闻

{{20170701T032855.821+0000}}UPDATE 3-U.S. warns businesses of hacking campaign against nuclear, energy firms(Adds comments from nuclear power generators)

By Jim Finkle

TORONTO, June 30 (Reuters) - The U.S government warned industrial firms this week about a hacking campaign targeting the nuclear and energy sectors, the latest event to highlight the power industry's vulnerability to cyber attacks.

Since at least May, hackers used tainted "phishing" emails to "harvest credentials" so they could gain access to networks of their targets, according to a joint report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of Investigation.

The report provided to the industrial firms was reviewed by Reuters on Friday. While disclosing attacks, and warning that in some cases hackers succeeded in compromising the networks of their targets, it did not identify any specific victims.

"Historically, cyber actors have strategically targeted the energy sector with various goals ranging from cyber espionage to the ability to disrupt energy systems in the event of a hostile conflict," the report said.

Homeland Security and FBI officials could not be reached for comment on the report, which was dated June 28.

The report was released during a week of heavy hacking activity.

A virus dubbed "NotPetya" attacked on Tuesday, spreading from initial infections in Ukraine to businesses around the globe. It encrypted data on infected machines, rendering them inoperable and disrupting activity at ports, law firms and factories. [L8N1JP55N]

On Tuesday the energy-industry news site E&E News reported that U.S. investigators were looking into cyber intrusions this year at multiple nuclear power generators.

Reuters has not confirmed details of the E&E News report, which said there was no evidence safety systems had been compromised at affected plants.

The activity described in the U.S. government report comes at a time when industrial firms are particularly anxious about threat that hackers pose to their operations.

Industrial firms, including power providers and other utilities, have been particularly worried about the potential for destructive cyber attacks since December 2016, when hackers cut electricity in Ukraine.

U.S. nuclear power generators PSEG , SCANA Corp and Entergy Corp said they were not impacted by the recent cyber attacks. SCANA's V.C. Summer nuclear plant in South Carolina shut down on Thursday due to a problem with a valve in the non-nuclear portion of the plant, a spokesman said.

Another nuclear power generator, Dominion Energy , said it does not comment on cyber security.

Two cyber security firms said on June 12 that they had identified the malicious software used in the Ukraine attack, which they dubbed Industroyer, warning that it could be easily modified to attack utilities in the United States and Europe. [L1N1J90J8]

Industroyer is only the second piece of malware uncovered to date that is capable of disrupting industrial processes without the need for hackers to manually intervene.

The first, Stuxnet, was discovered in 2010 and is widely believed by security researchers to have been used by the United States and Israel to attack Iran's nuclear program.

The U.S. government report said attackers conducted reconnaissance to gain information about the individuals whose computers they sought to infect so that they create "decoy documents" on topics of interest to their targets.

In an analysis, it described 11 files used in the attacks, including malware downloaders and tools that allow the hackers to take remote control of victim's computers and travel across their networks.

Chevron Corp , Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips , the three largest U.S. oil producers, declined to comment on their network security.

DBRS downgrades Cenovus after ConocoPhillips deal - 路透新闻

{{20170623T192903.388+0000}}DBRS downgrades Cenovus after ConocoPhillips dealCALGARY, Alberta, June 23 (Reuters) - Ratings agency DBRS on Friday downgraded Cenovus Energy Inc , saying the Canadian oil company's acquisition of ConocoPhillips assets in March negatively affects its credit and more than outweighs the benefits of the deal.

DBRS rated Cenovus at BBB, down one notch from BBB (high), in what the oil company said was its first downgrade following the deal.

Cenovus' debt-fueled $13.3 billion purchase of ConocoPhillips' oil sands and natural gas assets in March sparked a near 50 percent fall in shares. [nL3N1JH3I2]

The company's aim to pay down debt to restore its once-pristine balance sheet now hinges on selling conventional oil and gas assets in a market with a shrinking pool of buyers as oil prices hit 10-month lows around $42 a barrel . [O/R]

Fund managers have said those efforts face a rocky road ahead. [nL1N1JH1YF]

DBRS said the trend for the company is negative with Cenovus facing execution risk and uncertainty in its planned asset dispositions and ability to sufficiently reduce financial leverage.

Cenovus spokesman Brett Harris said in a statement the lower rating is still of "investment grade," on par with assessments by Standard & Poor's and Fitch, which have not downgraded Cenovus.

"DBRS noted that the revision in their outlook partially reflects the overall current weak pricing environment," he said.

"DBRS also noted that it would consider changing the trend to stable if we complete our asset sales at or above the midpoint of our targeted range and we're able to reduce debt."

Cenovus has said it would sell up to C$5 billion ($3.8 billion) of energy assets, an effort that fund managers have said is complicated by the surprise departure of Chief Executive Brian Ferguson, announced on Tuesday. ($1 = 1.3337 Canadian dollars)

RPT-Big Oil turns to big data to save big money on drilling - 路透新闻

{{20170623T110001.634+0000}}RPT-Big Oil turns to big data to save big money on drilling(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text)

By Swetha Gopinath and Liz Hampton

June 23 (Reuters) - In today's U.S. shale fields, tiny sensors attached to production gear harvest data on everything from pumping pressure to the heat and rotational speed of drill bits boring into the rocky earth.

The sensors are leading Big Oil's mining of so-called big data, with some firms envisioning billions of dollars in savings over time by avoiding outages, managing supplies and identifying safety hazards.

The industry has long used sophisticated technologies to find oil and gas. But only recently have oil firms pooled data from across the company for wider operating efficiencies - one of many cost-cutting efforts spurred by the two-year downturn in crude oil prices.

ConocoPhillips says that sensors scattered across its well fields helped it halve the time it once took to drill new wells in Eagle Ford shale basin of South Texas.

By comparing data from hundreds of sensors, its program automatically adjusts the weight placed on a drill bit and its speed, accelerating the extraction of oil, said Matt Fox, ConocoPhillips' executive vice president for strategy, exploration and technology.

It is just one application, but if applied to the more than 3,000 wells ConocoPhillips hopes to drill in the Texas basin, those small sensors could lead to "billions and billions of dollars" in savings, Fox said in an interview.

"We started using data analytics in our Eagle Ford business," he said. "And everywhere we look there are applications for this."

The cost and complexity of such systems vary widely. Oil giants such as ConocoPhillips buy a mix of off-the-shelf and custom programs, along with data repositories. The Houston-based producer's employees use Tibco Software Inc's Spotfire data visualization package to analyze information from well sites.

Tibco declined to discuss its pricing.

Services firms including Schlumberger NV and General Electric Co oil and gas unit sell sensor-equipped gear, data repositories and software to improve producers' decision-making.

Back when oil traded at more than $100 a barrel - before the price crash in 2014 - data analysis was an "afterthought" for most oil firms, said Binu Mathew, who oversees digital products at GE Oil & Gas.

Now - with prices at about $43 a barrel after recovering from a low of about $26 in early 2016 - "the efficiency aspect is far, far more important," Mathew said.

FINDING HIDDEN VALUE

A survey by Ernst & Young last year examined 75 large oil and gas companies and found that 68 percent of them had invested more than $100 million each in data analytics during the past two years. Nearly three quarters of those firms planned to allocate between 6 and 10 percent of their capital budgets to digital technology, the survey found.

Effectively mining large data sets could lead to supplanting workers with artificial intelligence and machine learning systems, according to firms selling and buying data-driven technology.

Simple sensors already increase safety and savings by eliminating the need to send workers to rigs or production facilities to gather data. Automating drilling decisions can produce more consistent results by cutting out human errors, said Duane Cuku, vice president of sales for rig technology at Precision Drilling Corp .

"The driller is now able to focus his attention on the well - and the performance and safety of his crews - as opposed to the manual manipulation of controls," Cuku said.

Occidental Petroleum Corp also uses an analytical tool to find the best design for hydraulic fracturing wells. A new version of the software analyzes data on well completions and geology to recommend whether injecting steam or water would produce more oil.

Abhishek Gaurav, a petroleum engineer for closely-held Texas Standard Oil, said he uses big-data analytics to help his company choose which properties to explore.

Using Spotfire, the same program utilized by Conoco, Standard applies a combination of data science and petroleum engineering to rank asking prices for land based on a variety of completion, production and geological variables - such as the amount of sand that likely would be required to complete a well in a given formation.

The technique, Gaurav said, has reduced the time needed for evaluating land parcels from weeks to hours - and resulted in better decisions.

"We found value in properties when many other teams did not," he said.

RECRUITING IN CALIFORNIA

Some of the information craved by oil firms isn't so easy to gather or analyze.

Surveys and maps that companies use to acquire acreage for drilling, for instance, are often not digitized. Older company data on wells may be unstructured or spread among suppliers using different storage formats, making integration and analysis a challenge.

General Electric and its oil-and-gas unit are moving aggressively into the business of digitizing industrial equipment for other firms, and have invested in large data processing centers for energy clients.

GE sees huge potential for market growth: A company study estimated that only 3 percent to 5 percent of oil and gas equipment is connected digitally, and less than one percent of the data collected gets used for decision-making, the study found.

Getting the industry more fully connected will take time.

"There is a huge amount of data prep, data sanitization and data extraction needed for big data to be totally disruptive," said Kate Richard, chief executive at private equity investor Warwick Energy.

She projects a major payoff from the technology is still five or ten years away.

Oklahoma City-based Warwick - which manages interests in thousands of wells across Oklahoma and Texas - is preparing for that payoff by hiring people from tech hubs in California, Richard said.

"They all have computer programming and data science backgrounds," she said.

UPDATE 1-Norway offers record number of blocks for Arctic oil exploration - 路透新闻

{{20170621T094514.903+0000}}UPDATE 1-Norway offers record number of blocks for Arctic oil exploration(Adds quotes, comments)

By Nerijus Adomaitis and Alister Doyle

OSLO, June 21 (Reuters) - Norway offered a record number of blocks for oil and gas exploration in the Arctic Barents Sea on Wednesday, brushing off concerns about the risks of drilling in the remote, icy environment.

The oil ministry proposed 102 blocks, comprising 93 in the Barents Sea and nine in the Norwegian Sea, despite calls from the Norway's Environment Agency to remove about 20 blocks near Bear Island, an important nesting site for Arctic birds.

The application deadline for Norway's 24th Arctic licensing round is Nov. 30 and the aim is to announce awards during the first half of 2018, the ministry said.

The 93 blocks proposed in the Barents Sea beat the previous record of 72 blocks offered in Norway's 22nd round

The country's Petroleum Directorate (NPD), which regulates the industry, said drilling in the Barents Sea was Norway's best chance of making new oil and gas discoveries. [nL8N1HX1QR]

"Therefore it's important to facilitate acreage for exploration in this area," the NPD said in a statement. "There's great interest, which also reflects the fact that 2017 is set to become a record year for exploration in the Barents Sea."

The latest offer drew sharp criticism from environmentalists, who said Western Europe's top oil and gas producer was ignoring the 2015 Paris climate agreement.

"This is an attack on the environment," Truls Gulowsen, head of Greenpeace Norway, told Reuters. "It's a confirmation that the Norwegian government doesn't take their own climate commitments from Paris seriously."

The Paris Agreement sets a goal of limiting the rise in global temperatures to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), ideally 1.5 (2.7F), above pre-industrial levels. Temperatures have already risen about 1 degree (1.8F).

Norway's petroleum sector contributes about 28 of the country's total emissions, which have to be limited according to the Paris Agreement.

Greenpeace is already taking the government to court over its previous licensing round, saying the expansion of exploration would raise emissions, violating the country's climate commitments.

The Norwegian Environment Agency had proposed expanding a non-drilling zone around Bear Island to 100 km from 65 km but about 20 blocks offered in the latest round fall within the new suggested exclusion zone.

The agency was not immediately available to comment.

UPDATE 1-Australia energy company requests arbitration in row over Senegal oil project - 路透新闻

{{20170621T024356.147+0000}}UPDATE 1-Australia energy company requests arbitration in row over Senegal oil project* FAR requests arbitration in dispute with Woodside

* Project would be first oil development in Senegal

* Woodside says Senegal govt confirms firm's participation

(Recasts on request for arbitration, adds detail)

June 21 (Reuters) - Woodside Petroleum on Wednesday confirmed that fellow Australian energy company FAR Ltd had requested arbitration in an ownership dispute that has delayed a promising oil project off Senegal.

The deepwater SNE project is being closely watched as it would be the first oil development in the West African nation, in an offshore area that has recently attracted oil giants BP Plc , Total SA and China's CNOOC Ltd <0883.HK>.

Woodside, Australia's biggest independent oil and gas producer, said in a statement that FAR had "apparently initiated arbitration proceedings". That came after FAR said on Tuesday that it had made a request to the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris to start arbitration.

The project was due to start production as early as 2021, but has faced delays due to the ongoing ownership dispute between the two Australian energy companies.

Woodside bought a 35-percent stake in the oil project last year from U.S. energy major ConocoPhillips and as part of the deal was due to become the operator later this year.

Woodside said earlier this month that minority stakeholder FAR Ltd had advised that it would not support arrangements for Woodside to take over as operator.

FAR contends that it should have had pre-emptive rights over the ConocoPhillips stake, which was sold for what was considered a cheap price of $350 million, and had said the Senegalese government was yet to approve the deal. [nL3N1J509D]

However, Woodside said in its statement on Wednesday that Senegal's energy minister had issued an order confirming the company's participation in the project.

Woodside shares fell 2.3 percent to A$29.22 ($22.13) in early trade on Wednesday, while shares of FAR were down 1.3 percent at A$0.074.

($1 = 1.3201 Australian dollars)

BREAKINGVIEWS-Cenovus fiasco a leverage warning for oil sector - 路透新闻

{{20170620T205215.758+0000}}BREAKINGVIEWS-Cenovus fiasco a leverage warning for oil sector(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)

By Lauren Silva Laughlin

DALLAS, June 20 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Cenovus is discovering that oil and leverage are a combustible combination. Brian Ferguson is stepping down as CEO of the Canadian company because its value has fallen by nearly half since its $13 billion purchase of assets from ConocoPhillips less than three months ago. Shareholders complain that he overpaid, and a fresh drop in crude prices threatens the company's plans to steady itself by selling more assets.

Ferguson had a different vision when he announced in March that Cenovus was buying out joint-venture partner Conoco's share of their Alberta oil-sands assets. The company has reduced its capital costs in the region by half since 2014, and the CEO claimed it would gain $650 million in net present value for every $1 per barrel reduction in finding and development cost. Though other rivals were selling, management was confident it could make the numbers add up.

Shareholders weren't so sure. Shares fell when the deal was announced and have since continued their decline. A main problem was that Cenovus paid a rich price. To finance the deal, the company had to take on more debt, which now sits at an uneasy 5.5 times next year's cash flow, according to Macquarie, putting it among the three most-levered Canadian energy companies out of the 34 the bank covers.

The company on Tuesday unveiled plans to sell more assets to pay down debt, but oil prices have dealt it a double whammy. They have fallen by more than 10 percent since the deal was announced, to around $43 a barrel. The company had been assuming a price around $50. Not surprisingly, the stock fell another 8 percent, bringing the drop since late March to more than 45 percent.

The leverage trap is not a new thing for oil companies. In the first quarter last year, when crude prices dipped below $30, energy and natural-resources companies made up more than half the defaults recorded by S&P Global Ratings. By the first quarter of this year, that share had fallen to just a fifth of all defaults. Companies like Conoco, Shell and others that sold assets in the meantime find themselves in much more comfortable shape than buyers like Cenovus. This fiasco is a reminder that lean balance sheets are a critical resource.

CONTEXT NEWS

- Cenovus Energy said on June 20 that President and Chief Executive Officer Brian Ferguson will retire on Oct. 31, 2017. He will stay on as an adviser reporting to the board chair until March 31, 2018.

- The company also said that it plans to offload between $4 billion and $5 billion of non-core assets by the end of the year. It had already agreed to sell $3.4 billion worth to help finance its acquisition of a variety of assets from ConocoPhillips, announced on March 29.

- In total Cenovus agreed to pay $13.3 billion for ConocoPhillips' 50 percent stake in the Foster Creek Christina Lake oil-sands partnership as well as the majority of its western Canada Deep Basin gas assets. Conoco received $10.6 billion in cash and 208 million Cenovus shares.

- Since the deal, oil prices have tumbled more than 13 percent. Cenovus shares were down more than 7 percent in afternoon trading on June 20. They have lost more than 45 percent of their value since the ConocoPhillips deal was agreed.

Cenovus to face investors amid rift after share decline - 路透新闻

{{20170620T110001.686+0000}}Cenovus to face investors amid rift after share declineBy Ethan Lou

CALGARY, Alberta, June 20 (Reuters) - Cenovus Energy Inc will seek on Tuesday to convince investors of the value of an unpopular acquisition this year amid continuing skepticism from shareholders.

At an annual investor event in Toronto, Chief Executive Brian Ferguson is expected to unveil plans for asset sales to cut debt assumed for the C$17 billion ($12.9 billion) March purchase of some ConocoPhillips assets in Canada. [nL4N1HY3VY]

The deal effectively doubled Cenovus' assets, a move the company has said would allow it to utilize economies of scale to lower costs. Cenovus shares have since fallen about 40 percent to just above C$10, wiping out $6.7 billion in the company's market value. [nL2N1H7108]

Two months after the deal is too soon to realize any benefits of the acquisition, and shareholders lack faith in management's ability to deliver, Laura Lau, senior vice president at Toronto-based Brompton Group, said in an interview. Brompton holds 183,800 Cenovus shares.

"They're not going to give them the benefit of the doubt," Lau said.

She said the same goes for asset sales. "It's too soon to actually know," she said. "What's probably likely is: 'We've put the package out. These are the packages, and these are the possible bids.'"

When asked about investors' skepticism, Cenovus spokesman Brett Harris said, "With respect to our conversations with individual investors, that's not something we would discuss publicly."

Cenovus expects a "fulsome discussion" about the acquired assets and the company's longer-term outlook on Tuesday, Harris said without providing additional details.

Royal Bank of Canada analyst Greg Pardy said in a note on Monday that questions from investors had increased over the past month, with the most significant being whether Cenovus can achieve its asset-sale target.

Cenovus has said it wants to raise C$3.6 billion by selling its Pelican Lake and Suffield oil assets and potentially others, including parts of its Deep Basin gas play, newly acquired from ConocoPhillips, which had been unpopular among investors who saw it as unwanted diversification. [nL1N1HV0HX]

"Most people view they overpaid for the assets, and now two months later, we're sitting with higher interest rates and oil prices that are 10 percent lower," said Len Racioppo, managing director of Toronto-based Coerente Capital Management.

"They say they want to sell assets, but how do you sell assets and what kind of a price do you get when you bought them at $50-something a barrel, and now we're at $45 a barrel?" Racioppo said.

Racioppo wrote to the Toronto Stock Exchange's regulator seeking to halt the deal soon after it was announced. He manages more than 500,000 shares on clients' behalf. [nL1N1HX13U]

Cenovus spokesman Harris said the company had invited its 100 largest shareholders to Tuesday's event, and Coerente was not among them.

"We can only have so many people attend the event in person. In fact, we have a waiting list, which is why we're also webcasting the event," Harris said. ($1 = 1.3215 Canadian dollars)

RPT-Mexico awaits next oil round with cautious optimism - 路透新闻

{{20170619T100102.567+0000}}RPT-Mexico awaits next oil round with cautious optimism(Repeats June 16 story for wider distribution.)

MEXICO CITY, June 16 (Reuters) - Mexico is looking forward to its next round of offshore oil auctions on Monday with guarded optimism thanks to robust interest from oil majors for the shallow-water tenders.

On Monday, Mexico auctions 15 oil and gas blocks along the southern coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico in the next stage of the country's historic opening of the industry following a 2013-14 energy reform.

In December 2013 Congress changed the constitution to end a 75-year production and exploration monopoly enjoyed by state oil company Pemex in a bid to reverse years of declining output.

Among the companies that prequalified to compete are Chevron Corp , ConocoPhillips , Eni SpA , Repsol SA , Royal Dutch Shell Plc , Total SA and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC Ltd) <0883.HK>.

All told, 20 companies signed up to take part on an individual basis, with 16 consortia also on the list.

Energy Minister Pedro Joaquin Coldwell said he was hopeful that at least 35 to 40 percent of the blocks would be won.

"The pleasing thing about this auction is the high number of consortia taking part, which is a sign there will be plenty of bids," he told Reuters on Friday. "There wouldn't be much point in forming a consortium and then not making an offer."

How many blocks were snapped up would depend on whether bidding focused on just a few areas, or many, he added.

The auction is the fifth since the energy reform, including one deep-water and two previous shallow-water tenders, yielding 39 contracts signed with forecast investment over the life of the contracts at $48.8 billion, according to energy ministry data.

Juan Carlos Zepeda, head of the oil regulator known as CNH which oversees the auction, also saw the number of equity tie-ups among oil companies as a positive sign, expressing optimism that "a bit more than the international benchmark of 30 percent" could be assigned.

The blocks up for auction are spread between the coastal waters of the Gulf states of Veracruz, Tabasco and Campeche, with an average size of 594 square kilometers.

If successful, the blocks could yield production of some 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in five years, the CNH estimates.

Total crude oil production in Mexico now stands at 2.01 million bpd, down from a peak of 3.38 million bpd in 2004.

Mexico awaits next oil round with cautious optimism - 路透新闻

{{20170616T202357.784+0000}}Mexico awaits next oil round with cautious optimismMEXICO CITY, June 16 (Reuters) - Mexico is looking forward to its next round of offshore oil auctions on Monday with guarded optimism thanks to robust interest from oil majors for the shallow-water tenders.

On Monday, Mexico auctions 15 oil and gas blocks along the southern coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico in the next stage of the country's historic opening of the industry following a 2013-14 energy reform.

In December 2013 Congress changed the constitution to end a 75-year production and exploration monopoly enjoyed by state oil company Pemex in a bid to reverse years of declining output.

Among the companies that prequalified to compete are Chevron Corp , ConocoPhillips , Eni SpA , Repsol SA , Royal Dutch Shell Plc , Total SA and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC Ltd) <0883.HK>.

All told, 20 companies signed up to take part on an individual basis, with 16 consortia also on the list.

Energy Minister Pedro Joaquin Coldwell said he was hopeful that at least 35 to 40 percent of the blocks would be won.

"The pleasing thing about this auction is the high number of consortia taking part, which is a sign there will be plenty of bids," he told Reuters on Friday. "There wouldn't be much point in forming a consortium and then not making an offer."

How many blocks were snapped up would depend on whether bidding focused on just a few areas, or many, he added.

The auction is the fifth since the energy reform, including one deep-water and two previous shallow-water tenders, yielding 39 contracts signed with forecast investment over the life of the contracts at $48.8 billion, according to energy ministry data.

Juan Carlos Zepeda, head of the oil regulator known as CNH which oversees the auction, also saw the number of equity tie-ups among oil companies as a positive sign, expressing optimism that "a bit more than the international benchmark of 30 percent" could be assigned.

The blocks up for auction are spread between the coastal waters of the Gulf states of Veracruz, Tabasco and Campeche, with an average size of 594 square kilometers.

If successful, the blocks could yield production of some 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in five years, the CNH estimates.

Total crude oil production in Mexico now stands at 2.01 million bpd, down from a peak of 3.38 million bpd in 2004.

Regulator sees Norway oil field shutdown costs at $4.2 bln during 2017-2021 - 路透新闻

{{20170615T094711.206+0000}}Regulator sees Norway oil field shutdown costs at $4.2 bln during 2017-2021OSLO, June 15 (Reuters) - The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate said on Thursday:

* Expects 10 to 20 fields on the Norwegian continental shelf to cease production by 2021 out of 80 producing fields at the beginning of 2017

* Expects oil companies to spend 23.4 billion Norwegian crowns ($2.76 billion) on decommissioning of oil and gas fields and 12 billion crowns on physical removal of installations on the Norwegian continental shelf during 2017-2021

* Expects 40-50 wells will need to be plugged and abandoned (P&A) per year in coming years, with P&A costs varying from 50 million crowns to several hundred million crowns

* Says fields that were closed after 2011 or are expected to be closed by 2021 account for less than 2 percent of production during that period

* Says oil companies spent 32.5 billion crowns on decommissioning and 8.5 billion crowns on installation removal on the NCS during the last five years

($1 = 8.4699 Norwegian crowns)

Malaysia's Petronas set to auction Kimanis crude on Dubai exchange - 路透新闻

{{20170614T102752.007+0000}}Malaysia's Petronas set to auction Kimanis crude on Dubai exchange* Plans to offer Sept crude next month on DME -sources

* To be first non-Middle East crude offered on Dubai exchange

* Kimanis output rising, record loadings planned for August

By Mark Tay

SINGAPORE, June 14 (Reuters) - Malaysia's Petronas [PETRA.UL] is set to auction one of its crude grades on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange, according to sources familiar with the matter, making the state-owned company the first to sell a non-Middle East oil on the trading platform.

Petronas has plans to offer September loadings of its Kimanis crude grade next month, the industry sources said.

DME documents - updated in June and posted on the exchange's website - indicate Petronas trading arm Petco is looking to sell the Kimanis grade over the Dubai platform, although without providing any details on volumes or timing.

Petronas and DME did not respond to queries on the matter.

The move comes amid rising Kimanis crude output, with the August loadings of the grade expected to rise to a record 12 cargoes of 600,000 barrels each. [nL3N1JA1ZA] [nL4N1E71Z4]

Rising Kimanis production and an overall global surplus has pressured primary sellers of the grade, including Petronas, Royal Dutch Shell , Murphy Oil , ConocoPhillips , Petroleum Brunei and Pertamina [PERTM.UL].

Kimanis premiums plunged to their lowest in nearly two years at around $1.50 a barrel to dated Brent in April, underscoring the difficulties sellers face in the current market.

"Kimanis needs to find new homes ... It's good to find new buyers apart from the usual end-users," a trading source who markets the grade said about Petronas' DME plans.

In a DME auction, potential buyers - who have to be pre-approved by the seller - will have two minutes to place bids after the company offering a cargo has set a minimum price.

"The auction does not mean a better price, but you get to set a floor price. So if you get better than the floor price, it's a good thing," said a source involved in the auction who is not approved to discuss the matter publicly.

Four cargoes of Middle East crude have been auctioned on the DME since January 2016. DME charges a 1.5 cent per barrel fee for cargoes sold via auction.

Kimanis is one of the largest Malaysian crude output streams. The Malaysian crude price mechanism introduced in 2014 was revised in January to add Kimanis to a benchmark formula based on the Labuan, Miri Light and Kikeh grades. [nL4N1DA3NA]

ConocoPhillips says Qatar LNG project not affected by Arab tension - 路透新闻

{{20170608T190653.084+0000}}ConocoPhillips says Qatar LNG project not affected by Arab tensionBy Ernest Scheyder

June 8 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips said on Thursday that production and exports of liquefied natural gas from an investment project in Qatar have not been affected by growing Middle East diplomatic tensions.

Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates on Monday cut ties with Qatar, accusing the country of supporting extremism. Qatar has denied the allegations.[nL3N1J226R]

Concerns have grown that global access to Qatar's LNG could be cut, especially after some Persian Gulf ports said they would not accept Qatari-flagged vessels. [nL3N1J33A3]

Houston-based ConocoPhillips owns a 30 percent stake in an LNG project operated by Qatargas Operating Co Ltd, part of the state-controlled energy company. Mitsui & Co Ltd <8031.T> owns a remaining 1.5 percent stake in the project, which processes about 1.4 billion cubic feet of gas per day.

"Production and the export of LNG from our operations have not been impacted" by the diplomatic tension, ConocoPhillips spokeswoman Emma Ahmed said in a statement to Reuters.

The investment was worth $869 million to ConocoPhillips at the end of 2016, according to regulatory filings.

The U.S. company loaned $1.2 billion to develop the Qatari LNG project in 2005, with roughly $696 million still to be paid back.

ConocoPhillips also controls the Golden Pass LNG facility in the United States along with Exxon Mobil Corp and Qatar Petroleum[QATPE.UL].

None of the LNG produced in Qatar, though, is sold in the United States.

Shares of ConocoPhillips were down slightly to $80.86 in afternoon trading.

UPDATE 1-Woodside faces delay on Senegal oil project over ownership row - 路透新闻

{{20170608T013147.759+0000}}UPDATE 1-Woodside faces delay on Senegal oil project over ownership row* Woodside says dispute may delay first oil from Senegal

* FAR says may pursue arbitration over pre-emptive rights

* SNE field set to be Senegal's first oil development

(Adds FAR MD comments)

By Sonali Paul

MELBOURNE, June 8 (Reuters) - A dispute between two Australian energy companies escalated on Thursday, potentially delaying a promising oil project off Senegal which was due to start producing as early as 2021.

The deepwater SNE project is being closely watched as it would be the first oil development in the West African nation, in an offshore area that has recently attracted oil giants BP Plc , Total SA and China's CNOOC Ltd <0883.HK>. [nL4N1IA443]

Woodside Petroleum , Australia's biggest independent oil and gas producer, bought a 35 percent stake in the project from ConocoPhillips last year and as part of the deal was due to become the operator later this year.

Woodside said on Thursday that minority stakeholder FAR Ltd had advised that it would not support arrangements for Woodside to take over as operator from Britain's Cairn Energy PLC .

FAR contends that it should have had pre-emptive rights over the ConocoPhillips stake, which was sold for what was considered a cheap price of $350 million, and has said the Senegalese government has yet to approve the deal. [nL3N1B43U7]

Woodside said it did not believe that FAR's claims had any merit.

"These actions by FAR put at risk the timely development of the SNE oil field in a prospective emerging basin," Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman said in the statement.

FAR Managing Director Cath Norman, who has kept a low profile over the ownership dispute up to now, said given that Woodside was not operator of the field, it could not claim that development would be delayed.

"We are correcting the mistruths that are in the announcement by Woodside stating that the development will be delayed. Cairn is the operator, not Woodside," Norman told Reuters.

FAR is planning to take the dispute to international arbitration if the pre-emptive rights are not resolved, Norman said, as the SNE project is its core asset, with an estimated resource of 641 million barrels.

Woodside has flagged the Senegal development as one of its key near term growth projects.

FAR has a 15 percent stake in the project, while Cairn Energy has a 40 percent stake and the state owns the remainder.

Spokesmen for Cairn were not immediately available to comment outside office hours.

Woodside faces delay on Senegal oil project over ownership row - 路透新闻

{{20170608T001847.138+0000}}Woodside faces delay on Senegal oil project over ownership rowMELBOURNE, June 8 (Reuters) - A dispute between two Australian energy companies escalated on Thursday, potentially delaying a promising oil project off Senegal which was due to start producing as early as 2021.

Woodside Petroleum , Australia's biggest independent oil and gas producer, said FAR Ltd had advised that it would not support arrangements for Woodside to become operator of the deepwater SNE project.

"Woodside does not believe that FAR's claims have any merit," the company said in a statement to the Australian stock exchange.

Woodside was due to become operator of the project later this year, after having bought a 35 percent stake in the project from ConocoPhillips last year.

FAR contends that it should have had pre-emptive rights over the ConocoPhillips stake, which was sold for what was considered a cheap price of $350 million, and has said the Senegalese government has yet to approve the deal. [nL3N1B43U7]

"These actions by FAR put at risk the timely development of the SNE oil field in a prospective emerging basin," Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman said in the statement.

FAR has a 15 percent stake in the project, while Britain's Cairn Energy PLC has a 40 percent stake and the state owns the remainder.

{{20170602T110501.633+0000}}RPT-Trump withdrawal from climate deal disappoints many U.S. companies(Repeats story that ran late June 1 with no changes to text)

By Emily Flitter and Valerie Volcovici

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday withdrawing the country from the Paris climate accord would stave off an economic crisis and protect American jobs - but many American companies seemed to disagree.

Criticism of his decision rolled in from blue-chip companies like Facebook Inc , Apple Inc , Ford Motor Co and Microsoft Corp , while the response from fossil fuel groups with the most to gain from a relaxation of U.S. carbon emissions standards was muted.

Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger said they would leave White House advisory councils over Trump's decision. [nL3N1IY5QF]

In an interview on Thursday, the president of the World Coal Association, Benjamin Sporton, told Reuters that he had mixed feelings about Trump's announcement, adding he was eager to see a U.S. policy that actively promotes a place for coal in the global energy mix.

"What we really need to see, if the president wants to re-enter the deal, is that he can change the agreement to recognize the role of all sources of energy, including coal," Sporton said, adding his group had described to administration officials the benefits of remaining in the agreement.

The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's biggest trade group, meanwhile, issued a statement saying it had never taken an official position on the Paris accord.

A number of its members, including Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips , had publicly supported the deal.

"For us, our position on the Paris agreement... we need a framework like that to address the risks of climate change," Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods told reporters on the sidelines of the company's annual general meeting on Wednesday. [nL1N1IX15V]

Some other groups expressed measured support for Trump's decision, saying it provided an opportunity to fix problems with the deal.

"Manufacturers support the spirit of the Paris Agreement and the effort to address climate change through a fair international agreement. But as the president has acknowledged, certain elements of this deal were not equitable for U.S. manufacturers," said Ross Eisenberg, vice president for energy and resources policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, in a statement to Reuters.

A spokesman for Peabody Energy Corp , America's largest publicly traded coal miner, had said on Wednesday that the company would support a decision by Trump to withdraw from the Paris deal because the "accord is flawed on a number of levels."

Trump vowed during his campaign to pull the United States out of the Paris deal, arguing the pact would cost the United States trillions of dollars, kill jobs, and stymie economic growth without providing tangible benefit.

His critics have argued, however, that the risks of climate change require action, and that a shift to a low-carbon energy economy can create more jobs than it eliminates.

"A SETBACK"

Spokespeople for other extractive oil and mining groups, like the National Mining Association and the American Fuel & Petrochemicals Manufacturers, declined to comment on Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris accord.

But a number of other business leaders derided it in forceful terms.

"Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world," said Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein in his first-ever tweet. [nL1N1IY2CK]

"Disappointed with today's decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government," tweeted General Electric Co's Jeff Immelt.

Apple's CEO Tim Cook, meanwhile, posted to Twitter: "Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet" and "Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver".

"Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children's future at risk," wrote Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post.

UPDATE 1-Woodside faces delay on Senegal oil project over ownership row - 路透新闻

{{20170608T013147.759+0000}}UPDATE 1-Woodside faces delay on Senegal oil project over ownership row* Woodside says dispute may delay first oil from Senegal

* FAR says may pursue arbitration over pre-emptive rights

* SNE field set to be Senegal's first oil development

(Adds FAR MD comments)

By Sonali Paul

MELBOURNE, June 8 (Reuters) - A dispute between two Australian energy companies escalated on Thursday, potentially delaying a promising oil project off Senegal which was due to start producing as early as 2021.

The deepwater SNE project is being closely watched as it would be the first oil development in the West African nation, in an offshore area that has recently attracted oil giants BP Plc , Total SA and China's CNOOC Ltd <0883.HK>. [nL4N1IA443]

Woodside Petroleum , Australia's biggest independent oil and gas producer, bought a 35 percent stake in the project from ConocoPhillips last year and as part of the deal was due to become the operator later this year.

Woodside said on Thursday that minority stakeholder FAR Ltd had advised that it would not support arrangements for Woodside to take over as operator from Britain's Cairn Energy PLC .

FAR contends that it should have had pre-emptive rights over the ConocoPhillips stake, which was sold for what was considered a cheap price of $350 million, and has said the Senegalese government has yet to approve the deal. [nL3N1B43U7]

Woodside said it did not believe that FAR's claims had any merit.

"These actions by FAR put at risk the timely development of the SNE oil field in a prospective emerging basin," Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman said in the statement.

FAR Managing Director Cath Norman, who has kept a low profile over the ownership dispute up to now, said given that Woodside was not operator of the field, it could not claim that development would be delayed.

"We are correcting the mistruths that are in the announcement by Woodside stating that the development will be delayed. Cairn is the operator, not Woodside," Norman told Reuters.

FAR is planning to take the dispute to international arbitration if the pre-emptive rights are not resolved, Norman said, as the SNE project is its core asset, with an estimated resource of 641 million barrels.

Woodside has flagged the Senegal development as one of its key near term growth projects.

FAR has a 15 percent stake in the project, while Cairn Energy has a 40 percent stake and the state owns the remainder.

Spokesmen for Cairn were not immediately available to comment outside office hours.

Woodside faces delay on Senegal oil project over ownership row - 路透新闻

{{20170608T001847.138+0000}}Woodside faces delay on Senegal oil project over ownership rowMELBOURNE, June 8 (Reuters) - A dispute between two Australian energy companies escalated on Thursday, potentially delaying a promising oil project off Senegal which was due to start producing as early as 2021.

Woodside Petroleum , Australia's biggest independent oil and gas producer, said FAR Ltd had advised that it would not support arrangements for Woodside to become operator of the deepwater SNE project.

"Woodside does not believe that FAR's claims have any merit," the company said in a statement to the Australian stock exchange.

Woodside was due to become operator of the project later this year, after having bought a 35 percent stake in the project from ConocoPhillips last year.

FAR contends that it should have had pre-emptive rights over the ConocoPhillips stake, which was sold for what was considered a cheap price of $350 million, and has said the Senegalese government has yet to approve the deal. [nL3N1B43U7]

"These actions by FAR put at risk the timely development of the SNE oil field in a prospective emerging basin," Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman said in the statement.

FAR has a 15 percent stake in the project, while Britain's Cairn Energy PLC has a 40 percent stake and the state owns the remainder.

RPT-Trump withdrawal from climate deal disappoints many U.S. companies - 路透新闻

By Emily Flitter and Valerie Volcovici

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday withdrawing the country from the Paris climate accord would stave off an economic crisis and protect American jobs - but many American companies seemed to disagree.

Criticism of his decision rolled in from blue-chip companies like Facebook Inc , Apple Inc , Ford Motor Co and Microsoft Corp , while the response from fossil fuel groups with the most to gain from a relaxation of U.S. carbon emissions standards was muted.

Tesla Inc Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk and Walt Disney Co CEO Robert Iger said they would leave White House advisory councils over Trump's decision. [nL3N1IY5QF]

In an interview on Thursday, the president of the World Coal Association, Benjamin Sporton, told Reuters that he had mixed feelings about Trump's announcement, adding he was eager to see a U.S. policy that actively promotes a place for coal in the global energy mix.

"What we really need to see, if the president wants to re-enter the deal, is that he can change the agreement to recognize the role of all sources of energy, including coal," Sporton said, adding his group had described to administration officials the benefits of remaining in the agreement.

The American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's biggest trade group, meanwhile, issued a statement saying it had never taken an official position on the Paris accord.

A number of its members, including Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips , had publicly supported the deal.

"For us, our position on the Paris agreement... we need a framework like that to address the risks of climate change," Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods told reporters on the sidelines of the company's annual general meeting on Wednesday. [nL1N1IX15V]

Some other groups expressed measured support for Trump's decision, saying it provided an opportunity to fix problems with the deal.

"Manufacturers support the spirit of the Paris Agreement and the effort to address climate change through a fair international agreement. But as the president has acknowledged, certain elements of this deal were not equitable for U.S. manufacturers," said Ross Eisenberg, vice president for energy and resources policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, in a statement to Reuters.

A spokesman for Peabody Energy Corp , America's largest publicly traded coal miner, had said on Wednesday that the company would support a decision by Trump to withdraw from the Paris deal because the "accord is flawed on a number of levels."

Trump vowed during his campaign to pull the United States out of the Paris deal, arguing the pact would cost the United States trillions of dollars, kill jobs, and stymie economic growth without providing tangible benefit.

His critics have argued, however, that the risks of climate change require action, and that a shift to a low-carbon energy economy can create more jobs than it eliminates.

"A SETBACK"

Spokespeople for other extractive oil and mining groups, like the National Mining Association and the American Fuel & Petrochemicals Manufacturers, declined to comment on Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris accord.

But a number of other business leaders derided it in forceful terms.

"Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world," said Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein in his first-ever tweet. [nL1N1IY2CK]

"Disappointed with today's decision on the Paris Agreement. Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government," tweeted General Electric Co's Jeff Immelt.

Apple's CEO Tim Cook, meanwhile, posted to Twitter: "Decision to withdraw from the #ParisAgreeement was wrong for our planet" and "Apple is committed to fight climate change and we will never waver".

"Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, and it puts our children's future at risk," wrote Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post.
