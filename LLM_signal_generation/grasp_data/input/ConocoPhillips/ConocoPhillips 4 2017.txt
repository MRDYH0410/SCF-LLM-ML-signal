Canada oil bets on tech, scale in face of foreign majors' exodus - 路透新闻

{{20170428T210236.134+0000}}Canada oil bets on tech, scale in face of foreign majors' exodusBy Nia Williams and Ethan Lou

CALGARY, Alberta, April 28 (Reuters) - As global oil majors pull out of Canada's oil sands, domestic companies are buying up assets and betting technology and economies of scale will enable them to turn a profit despite low crude prices.

Global energy majors have sold off more than $22.5 billion worth of Canadian oil sands assets so far this year, concerned about depressed oil prices, high production costs and carbon emissions and limited pipeline access to market. [nL1N1HS2FZ]

Three of Canada's biggest oil and gas companies reported first-quarter earnings and held annual general meetings this week, in which they talked up opportunities in the region despite global firms pulling back. [nL1N1HS1KC]

"We are transforming our company at a pivotal time in the industry and at the beginning of a technological renaissance," Cenovus Energy Inc Chief Executive Officer Brian Ferguson told investors on Wednesday. [nL4N1HY3VY]

Cenovus last month announced a C$17.7 billion ($12.98 billion) deal to buy ConocoPhillips assets, doubling the size of the Canadian company. The market baulked at the ambitious acquisition and Cenovus stock lost a fifth of its value, but Ferguson insists the logic behind the deal is sound.

He predicts 2016 to 2020 will be period in which rapid technology development in areas including drilling, solvent-assisted bitumen extraction and automation will result in massive cost savings.

Suncor Energy Inc CEO Steve Williams said the sector consolidation was very positive for the industry and Canada. [nL1N1HZ227]

"The oil sands business needs focused operators with strong balance sheets and deep expertise," Williams said on an earnings call. "We expect the transition to more concentrated oil sands leaders to enable regional synergies and technology development that will drive the sector forward and ensure its global competitiveness for decades to come."

Suncor, Canada's largest energy company, bought a majority-share in the Syncrude mining and upgrading project last year.

The facility cut production after a fire in March but Suncor's main oil sands plant nearby has helped manage Syncrude's bitumen inventories during the outage, a move that Williams said was a good example of how to leverage expanded infrastructure. [nL2N1H40MG]

Imperial Oil Ltd , majority-owned by Exxon Mobil Corp , has so far held back from buying up any oil sands assets, but CEO Rich Kruger said Canada's vast bitumen reserves were an incredible resource with improving economic and environmental competitiveness.

"Our industry has shown we have an ability to make things better and better over time, so don't bet against the Canadian oil sands," he said.

WEEK AHEAD

Apple Inc is expected to post its second straight quarter of revenue growth on Tuesday, buoyed by sales of its high-end smartphones, particularly the iPhone 7 Plus. Analysts will be keeping an eye on Apple's typically conservative June-quarter forecast, which takes into account the lull in spending just before the company launches its latest phone. Investors will also be expecting Apple to increase its buyback program and dividends.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee's two-day meeting on interest rates will commence, with their decision announced on Wednesday. On Friday, Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer will speak before the Hoover Monetary Policy Conference in Stanford, California. At the same event later in the day, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard will participate in a panel on, "The Structural Foundations of Monetary Policy". On the same day in New York, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams is scheduled to speak before the Shadow Open Market Committee.

Attention shifts to next week's April employment report, manufacturing and services sector surveys for confirmation that a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter was an aberration. The Institute for Supply Management will likely report on Monday that its national manufacturing index slipped to 56.4 in April from a reading of 57.2 in March. Also on Monday, the Commerce Department is expected to report that consumer spending increased 0.3 percent in March after edging up 0.1 percent in February. On Wednesday, the ISM is likely to report that its non-manufacturing index increased to 55.8 in April from 55.2 in March. Data on Thursday from the Commerce Department is expected to show the trade deficit rose to $44.5 billion in March from $43.6 billion in February. Also on Thursday, the Labor Department is likely to report that productivity increased at a 0.2 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, after rising at a 1.3 percent pace in the fourth quarter. On Friday, the Labor Department's closely watched employment report is expected to show nonfarm payrolls increased 180,000 in April after rising 89,000 in March. The unemployment rate is forecast ticking up to 4.6 percent from 4.5 percent in March. Average hourly earnings are expected to have increased 0.3 percent after gaining 0.2 percent in March.

Social media giant Facebook Inc is expected to post a jump in first-quarter revenue on Wednesday. For the past few quarters Facebook's mobile-ad sales have been soaring, boosting its overall growth. However, the company warned in November that ad growth would likely slow "meaningfully" due to limits on "ad load." Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in February that the company expects a major ramp-up in hiring and other spending during 2017 as it invests in video and other priorities.

Three of the largest U.S. insurers, American International Group Inc, MetLife Inc and Prudential Inc are scheduled to hold earnings calls to discuss results announced after the market closes on Wednesday. All eyes will be on AIG, whose board is hunting for a new CEO after a large 2016 fourth quarter loss roiled shareholders. First-quarter results will reveal the impact of an uptick in March catastrophe losses for property insurers, including AIG, which prompted at least one analyst to lower estimates for AIG and others. Prudential's and MetLife's report will show whether results align with analysts' rosy expectations for a strong quarter among life insurers.

MasterCard Inc, the world's No. 2 payments network, is expected to report a rise in revenue and profit on Tuesday, helped by higher purchase volumes. Investors would be interested in any guidance on the year ahead, including on expenses, as MasterCard has been focusing on digital growth.

Pfizer Inc is expected to post weaker first-quarter revenue before the bell on Tuesday, as the U.S. drugmaker's portfolio groans under the weight of looming patent expirations, as well as those that have already begun to chip away at sales. After deciding against splitting itself up last year, there will be considerable focus on Pfizer's traditionally voracious appetite for M&A as it looks to strengthen its ship, with chatter about Bristol-Myers' Squibb as a potential target doing the rounds. On the same day Merck & Co is scheduled to report first-quarter results. With the next frontier in cancer immunotherapy within reach, investors will be laser focused on the performance of Merck's Keytruda, after Bristol-Myers reported strong quarterly growth for rival drug Opdivo last week. Considered Merck's most significant growth driver, Wall Street is hoping for signs that Keytruda and other drugs in the company's pipeline will be enough to offset patent expirations on many key products.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc, the conglomerate run by billionaire Warren Buffett, is expected to report first-quarter results on Friday after U.S. markets close. The results are to be issued one day before Berkshire holds its annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger are expected for five hours to answer questions from shareholders, investors and analysts on Saturday, the centerpiece of a weekend of events throughout the city.

Time Warner Inc, which is being bought by AT&T, is expected to report a rise in first-quarter revenue on Wednesday, helped by the success of its movies 'Kong' and 'The Lego Batman Movie' as well as higher cable revenues. In January, AT&T said it expected to be able to bypass the U.S. FCC in its planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner because it would not seek to transfer any significant Time Warner licenses.

Tesla Inc is scheduled to report first-quarter results on Wednesday after markets close. Shortly after, Chief Executive Elon Musk is scheduled to hold an investor call.

Mondelez International Inc's first quarter profit is likely to beat analysts' estimates on Tuesday, helped by cost cuts through its zero-based budgeting plan. Mondelez has targeted cost savings of 30-50 percent in 12 areas, including travel, sales support services and business events. Investors will look forward to the company's 2017 profit forecast to know the efficacy of its cost-cutting plan. Separately, Kraft Heinz Co's quarterly revenue growth is likely to have slowed as the company has been forced to adjust its products as shoppers increasingly shun packaged foods for fresher items and those perceived to be healthier. However, Kraft Heinz, reporting on Wednesday, has also been benefiting from lower prices of raw materials, including dairy products and coffee, which is likely to lift its quarterly profit. Investors will be looking forward to any news about the company's strategy in the near future and its 2017 profit and revenue forecasts as its bid to take over Anglo-Dutch company Unilever recently fell apart.

ConocoPhillips, the largest independent oil company in the United States, is expected to swing to a quarterly profit on Tuesday, helped by the rise in oil prices. Conoco has been selling assets to reduce its exposure to profit-sapping natural gas assets and to shore up its balance sheet. Investors will seek details of the company's plans to sell assets worth $17 billion to Cenovus Energy - a transaction that has irked investors of the Canadian company, who have complained that the deal price is too high. Oil and gas producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp is expected to post a smaller quarterly loss on Tuesday, buoyed by rising oil prices. The company set a higher capital budget for the year in March to focus on higher-margin oil production. Investors will seek details of the company's drilling plans for the year. Occidental Petroleum Corp is expected to report a smaller quarterly profit on Thursday as high costs outweigh gains from a rise in crude prices. Occidental, which has cut its budget for the year, has been focusing on Texas' prolific Permian basin. Analysts and investors seek details on the company's plans to reduce costs.

Humana Inc reports first-quarter earnings before the bell on Wednesday. The health insurer, which has pre-announced its first-quarter profit, is likely to benefit from strength in its Medicare Advantage business. Investors will watch out for comments about President Donald Trump's plan to revamp the U.S. healthcare system. Humana has said it would exit Obamacare business in 2018. Aetna Inc, the No. 3 U.S. health insurer, is scheduled to report its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, followed by Cigna Corp on Friday, before the market opens. Cigna is also waiting for a decision from a federal appeals court, which had been asked to rule on whether the Justice Department could stop Cigna and Anthem Inc's $54 billion merger on antitrust grounds.

IT services provider Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp is expected to report a rise in first-quarter revenue on Friday. The company is benefiting a huge demand for its digital and cloud services. Investors and analysts would be looking out for Cognizant's comments on U.S. President Trump's tough stance on H1-B visa rules. About three-quarters of Cognizant's employees are in India.

CVS Health Corp, a drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager (PBM), lowered its full-year PBM unit revenue growth forecast, which analysts partly attributed to branded drug price increases coming in lower than anticipated. CVS said in March it had lost a contract to manage specialty drug benefits for the Federal Employee Program to Prime Therapeutics. Traffic in its stores is also expected to have been weak in the quarter. The company will report on Tuesday. Separately, drug wholesaler AmerisourceBergen Corp will report first-quarter earnings before the market opens on Thursday. Pharmaceutical supply chain, including pharmacy benefit managers and drug distributors, have been squeezed as a result of pricing pressure due to heightened scrutiny over drug price hikes. Investors will also focus on pricing commentary related to independent pharmacy networks.

Viacom Inc, the owner of MTV, Comedy Central and the Paramount film studio, is seen reporting a fall in quarterly profit on Thursday. The company has faced several quarters of declines in domestic advertising revenue as it grapples with shifting audience preferences. CEO Bakish is making Paramount a major part of his strategy to turn around the media conglomerate's declining ad revenue and ratings. Separately on the same day, CBS Corp, owner of the most widely-viewed U.S. television network, is expected to post a drop in first-quarter revenue, in part due to a strong year-ago quarter that benefited from the 2016 Super Bowl and political ad spend.

Yum Brands Inc's Pizza Hut chain is expected to continue its string of falling same-store sales, while rival Domino's reported a better-than-expected 14 percent jump in U.S. comparable sales. However, Taco Bell is expected to have benefited from promotions, while KFC is expected to have had steady growth. Yum Brands is scheduled to report its results on Wednesday. Dunkin Brands Group Inc, the owner of Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin Robbins, issued a conservative 2017 forecast in February, forecasting low single-digit comparable U.S. sales growth for both the chains. Dunkin' is streamlining its menus to speed up service, reducing waste and could potentially reduce staff turnover by making employees' work easier. The company is expected to report on Thursday. Sprint Corp is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Wednesday. The wireless carrier is expected to post a rise in profit as it benefits from revamped plans that offer unlimited data. Investors and analysts will be looking out for any comments on a potential deal with rival T-Mobile.

Akamai Technologies Inc is expected to report a rise in first-quarter revenue, driven by strong demand for its security services. However, Akamai has been experiencing continued slowdown in its media delivery business after some of its large customers shifted to their own delivery networks, and this could hurt the company's future revenue. The company is scheduled to report on Tuesday. On the same day, FireEye Inc is expected to report its second straight fall in quarterly revenue. The cybersecurity company has been struggling to regain momentum in a highly competitive market and is also coping with a string of executive departures. The company is also shifting to a subscription-based revenue model, which is expected to lead to more stable revenue streams in the future.

Kellogg Co, the world's largest maker of breakfast cereals, has seen its profits rise due to restructuring program, "Project K", launched to counter slowing sales as Americans choose healthier options over processed foods. Investors will look out for additional cost-cutting actions under the program. The company is expected to report first-quarter results on Thursday.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, which is facing slowing sales of its blockbuster eye drug Eylea, is expected to report first-quarter results before the bell on Thursday. Investors will be looking for comments on company's potential blockbuster treatments Dupixent and Sarilumab, as the U.S. biotech reduces reliance on Eylea. Investors will also seek details on the company and partner Sanofi SA' patent war against Amgen Inc for its cholestrol drug Praluent and eczema treatment Dupixent. Separately on Tuesday, Gilead Sciences Inc, maker of HIV and hepatitis treatments, is scheduled to report first-quarter results.

Chesapeake Energy Corp, the second-largest U.S. natural gas producer, is expected to swing to a quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by improved oil and gas prices. Investors will look for an update on the company's plans to accelerate its debt reduction target of $2 billion-$3 billion over the next few years through additional asset sales. On the same day, Apache Corp is expected to swing to a quarterly profit, also bolstered by higher crude prices. The company set a higher spending target for 2017 earlier this year, encouraged by the price recovery. Investors will seek details on Apache's drilling plans for the year. Offshore drilling contractor Noble Corp Plc is expected to post a quarterly loss on Thursday, compared with a year-ago profit, as customer spending on expensive offshore projects remains weak. Investors will seek details of the company's order book and efforts to cut costs amid the prolonged slump in demand. On Tuesday, Devon Energy Corp is expected to report a first-quarter profit, compared with a year-ago loss, as rising oil prices boost cash flows. Investors will seek details of the company's drilling plans for the year.

HCA Holdings Inc, the largest U.S. for-profit hospital operator, reports first-quarter results before the bell on Tuesday. HCA, which pre-announced part of its results, is expected to report soft volumes due to weak hospital operating environment. Investors will watch out for comments on the likely impact of on hospital operators from the Trump administration's plan to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system.

Videogame publisher Activision Blizzard Inc is expected to report a rise in quarterly revenue and profit on Thursday, helped by higher digital downloads of its games and its acquisition of Candy Crush maker King Digital. Activision Blizzard recently unveiled the latest installment of its popular Call of Duty franchise, set around events in World War II and characters such as Nazi Zombies. After the disappointing performance of 2016's game, analysts and investors will be closely watching any commentary from Activision and player's responses to gauge how the game will be received when it releases in late 2017. Zynga Inc is expected to report a rise in quarterly revenue on Thursday, helped by its popular franchises including Zynga Poker and Words With Friends. Advertising revenue from its games in the period is expected to be typically lean, but analysts are looking beyond the quarter to see what Zynga's game slate for 2017 is like.

On Tuesday, agricultural trader Archer Daniels Midland will report first-quarter earnings amid abundant global grain stocks that have lowered costs for the raw materials it processes into vegetable oil, corn sweetener and ethanol. But the plentiful crop supplies have also squeezed trading margins and the company has been shedding traders around the world. Separately on Wednesday, Bunge Ltd will report first-quarter results. Investors will be watching for clues on crop marketing in Brazil and Argentina, where farmers are harvesting bumper corn and soy crops, as a large share of Bunge's assets are in South America.

First Solar Inc is expected to report a first-quarter loss on Tuesday, compared with a year-ago profit, as it transitions to a new product ahead of schedule. Solar companies have been struggling with a sharp decline in panel prices since mid-2016, but the company said in February that bookings had picked up since the end of last year. Analysts and investors will look for comments on panel pricing and demand.

On Wednesday, New York Times Co is expected to report a drop in first-quarter profit, hurt by higher operating costs. However, the magazine and newspaper publisher has been ramping up its digital business to offset its declining print sales.

On Tuesday, U.S.-based fertilizer maker Mosaic Co is expected to post a bigger first-quarter profit, as potash prices modestly rebound. Investors will be interested in any updates on Mosaic's acquisition of Vale's fertilizer assets. On Wednesday, U.S. nitrogen fertilizer producer CF Industries reports first-quarter results. Of interest to investors are the company's thoughts on new U.S. production coming online this year, which could weigh on prices.

Estee Lauder Cos Inc is scheduled to report third-quarter results on Wednesday. The cosmetics maker has been struggling with low mall traffic in the United States as shoppers increasingly prefer to buy personal products online. Investors will look out for comments on tourist spending, both within the U.S. and in major international markets. Handbag maker Coach Inc is expected to report a dip in third-quarter sales on the same day. The company has been battling rising competition and increased discounting. Coach, in a push to regain its premium tag, has tightened inventory and cut back on promotions in North America.

Fitbit Inc is expected to post its second straight fall in quarterly revenue on Wednesday as the fitness band maker grapples with waning demand for its fitness tracking bands in a maturing market. Analysts and investors will be on the looking out for a new product cycle.

Denver-based Molson Coors Brewing Co is expected to report a jump in quarterly sales and profit, helped by its $12 billion acquisition last year of the remaining 58 percent of MillerCoors from beer giant SABMiller. The deal made Molson Coors, known for its flagship Coors Light brew, the third-largest brewer in the world. A strong U.S. dollar, which is expected to stay strong, will likely have tempered earnings and investors will look for any currency impact down the line.

TransCanada Corp reports first-quarter results and holds its annual general meeting on Friday. Investors will be looking for updates on shipper commitments on its recently approved Keystone XL crude oil pipeline, which is still awaiting route approval in Nebraska.

Home Capital Group, Canada biggest non-bank lender, is scheduled to report first-quarter results on Wednesday. On Thursday, Ontario's financial regulator hears a case against the company, whose shares fell 50 percent and which is looking at strategic options.

Encana Corp, Canada's No. 2 oil and natural gas producer, is expected to swing to a quarterly profit, helped by higher oil prices. Investors will look for details on the company's drilling plans for the year when it reports on Tuesday. In recent years Encana has narrowed operations to focus on four core North American plays: the Montney and Duvernay in Western Canada, and the Eagle Ford and Permian in the United States. Separately, Husky Energy Inc is expected to post a quarterly profit on Friday, compared with a year-ago loss, as it sells more crude oil at higher prices.

A decision on that is expected in the third quarter.

Cardinal Health will report its third-quarter results before the market opens. The results come a week after the drug distributor said it would buy Medtronic Plc's medical supplies units for $6.1 billion to add heft to its growing medical products business. The move was, however, overshadowed by the company's dour forecast, underscoring the U.S. drug distribution industry's struggles with declining generic drug prices.

Debt-laden hospital operators Community Health and Tenet Healthcare will report first-quarter results after market close.

UPDATE 3-Cenovus faces investor displeasure after ConocoPhillips deal - 路透新闻

{{20170426T235152.642+0000}}UPDATE 3-Cenovus faces investor displeasure after ConocoPhillips deal(Recasts with results of shareholder vote)

By Ethan Lou

CALGARY, Alberta, April 26 (Reuters) - Cenovus Energy Inc won about 87 percent of shareholders' votes for its board of director slate on Wednesday, below previous near-unanimous approvals, as some voters protested the company's C$17 billion ($12.6 billion) purchase of ConocoPhillips assets.

The deal, announced in March, effectively doubled the size of the Canadian oil company, but wiped out about a fifth of its market value, with some investors complaining that the price was too high. [nL1N1HX13U]

Even as Cenovus posted better-than-expected first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, questions about the deal and Cenovus' ability to execute it dogged a conference call about the results and the shareholders meeting later that day.

A shareholder who wanted to be known only as Bernie told management: "If you guys are so confident on the deal, why don't shareholders have the opportunity to vote?"

Investors had been "left out in the cold," he said. "I very much resent that."

Chairman Michael Grandin responded that the "once-in-a-lifetime" deal required confidentiality for negotiations that a shareholder vote would deny.

Chief Executive Brian Ferguson said the Deep Basin natural gas asset bought from ConocoPhillips, which some investors said was incompatible with Cenovus' oil business, was "absolutely core" to the company and could be its "crown jewel."

Cenovus could reduce spending on Deep Basin to focus on oil sands, and also sell part of that natural gas asset, he added.

Ferguson told media after the meeting that the roughly 87 percent vote tally reflected confidence in the deal, which is expected to close in the second quarter.

Cenovus plans to fund the deal partly through divestitures, mainly of its Suffield and Pelican Lake conventional oil and gas assets.

The company will provide more details on those in the third quarter, Ferguson said earlier on Wednesday.

Cenovus reported a C$211 million ($155.54 million) profit in the quarter ended March 31, helped by lower operating costs and higher production. Net profit was 25 Canadian cents per share, compared with a loss of C$118 million, or 14 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier. [nCCN7Z6bqm]

Operating loss was 5 Canadian cents per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of a loss of 8 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Cenovus said operating costs for its oil sands fell 6 percent to C$8.97 per barrel, while total oil production rose about 19 percent to 234,914 barrels per day. ($1 = 1.3566 Canadian dollars)

Canada oil bets on tech, scale in face of foreign majors' exodus - 路透新闻

{{20170428T210236.134+0000}}Canada oil bets on tech, scale in face of foreign majors' exodusBy Nia Williams and Ethan Lou

CALGARY, Alberta, April 28 (Reuters) - As global oil majors pull out of Canada's oil sands, domestic companies are buying up assets and betting technology and economies of scale will enable them to turn a profit despite low crude prices.

Global energy majors have sold off more than $22.5 billion worth of Canadian oil sands assets so far this year, concerned about depressed oil prices, high production costs and carbon emissions and limited pipeline access to market. [nL1N1HS2FZ]

Three of Canada's biggest oil and gas companies reported first-quarter earnings and held annual general meetings this week, in which they talked up opportunities in the region despite global firms pulling back. [nL1N1HS1KC]

"We are transforming our company at a pivotal time in the industry and at the beginning of a technological renaissance," Cenovus Energy Inc Chief Executive Officer Brian Ferguson told investors on Wednesday. [nL4N1HY3VY]

Cenovus last month announced a C$17.7 billion ($12.98 billion) deal to buy ConocoPhillips assets, doubling the size of the Canadian company. The market baulked at the ambitious acquisition and Cenovus stock lost a fifth of its value, but Ferguson insists the logic behind the deal is sound.

He predicts 2016 to 2020 will be period in which rapid technology development in areas including drilling, solvent-assisted bitumen extraction and automation will result in massive cost savings.

Suncor Energy Inc CEO Steve Williams said the sector consolidation was very positive for the industry and Canada. [nL1N1HZ227]

"The oil sands business needs focused operators with strong balance sheets and deep expertise," Williams said on an earnings call. "We expect the transition to more concentrated oil sands leaders to enable regional synergies and technology development that will drive the sector forward and ensure its global competitiveness for decades to come."

Suncor, Canada's largest energy company, bought a majority-share in the Syncrude mining and upgrading project last year.

The facility cut production after a fire in March but Suncor's main oil sands plant nearby has helped manage Syncrude's bitumen inventories during the outage, a move that Williams said was a good example of how to leverage expanded infrastructure. [nL2N1H40MG]

Imperial Oil Ltd , majority-owned by Exxon Mobil Corp , has so far held back from buying up any oil sands assets, but CEO Rich Kruger said Canada's vast bitumen reserves were an incredible resource with improving economic and environmental competitiveness.

"Our industry has shown we have an ability to make things better and better over time, so don't bet against the Canadian oil sands," he said.

WEEK AHEAD

Apple Inc is expected to post its second straight quarter of revenue growth on Tuesday, buoyed by sales of its high-end smartphones, particularly the iPhone 7 Plus. Analysts will be keeping an eye on Apple's typically conservative June-quarter forecast, which takes into account the lull in spending just before the company launches its latest phone. Investors will also be expecting Apple to increase its buyback program and dividends.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee's two-day meeting on interest rates will commence, with their decision announced on Wednesday. On Friday, Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer will speak before the Hoover Monetary Policy Conference in Stanford, California. At the same event later in the day, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard will participate in a panel on, "The Structural Foundations of Monetary Policy". On the same day in New York, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams is scheduled to speak before the Shadow Open Market Committee.

Attention shifts to next week's April employment report, manufacturing and services sector surveys for confirmation that a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the first quarter was an aberration. The Institute for Supply Management will likely report on Monday that its national manufacturing index slipped to 56.4 in April from a reading of 57.2 in March. Also on Monday, the Commerce Department is expected to report that consumer spending increased 0.3 percent in March after edging up 0.1 percent in February. On Wednesday, the ISM is likely to report that its non-manufacturing index increased to 55.8 in April from 55.2 in March. Data on Thursday from the Commerce Department is expected to show the trade deficit rose to $44.5 billion in March from $43.6 billion in February. Also on Thursday, the Labor Department is likely to report that productivity increased at a 0.2 percent annualized rate in the first quarter, after rising at a 1.3 percent pace in the fourth quarter. On Friday, the Labor Department's closely watched employment report is expected to show nonfarm payrolls increased 180,000 in April after rising 89,000 in March. The unemployment rate is forecast ticking up to 4.6 percent from 4.5 percent in March. Average hourly earnings are expected to have increased 0.3 percent after gaining 0.2 percent in March.

Social media giant Facebook Inc is expected to post a jump in first-quarter revenue on Wednesday. For the past few quarters Facebook's mobile-ad sales have been soaring, boosting its overall growth. However, the company warned in November that ad growth would likely slow "meaningfully" due to limits on "ad load." Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in February that the company expects a major ramp-up in hiring and other spending during 2017 as it invests in video and other priorities.

Three of the largest U.S. insurers, American International Group Inc, MetLife Inc and Prudential Inc are scheduled to hold earnings calls to discuss results announced after the market closes on Wednesday. All eyes will be on AIG, whose board is hunting for a new CEO after a large 2016 fourth quarter loss roiled shareholders. First-quarter results will reveal the impact of an uptick in March catastrophe losses for property insurers, including AIG, which prompted at least one analyst to lower estimates for AIG and others. Prudential's and MetLife's report will show whether results align with analysts' rosy expectations for a strong quarter among life insurers.

MasterCard Inc, the world's No. 2 payments network, is expected to report a rise in revenue and profit on Tuesday, helped by higher purchase volumes. Investors would be interested in any guidance on the year ahead, including on expenses, as MasterCard has been focusing on digital growth.

Pfizer Inc is expected to post weaker first-quarter revenue before the bell on Tuesday, as the U.S. drugmaker's portfolio groans under the weight of looming patent expirations, as well as those that have already begun to chip away at sales. After deciding against splitting itself up last year, there will be considerable focus on Pfizer's traditionally voracious appetite for M&A as it looks to strengthen its ship, with chatter about Bristol-Myers' Squibb as a potential target doing the rounds. On the same day Merck & Co is scheduled to report first-quarter results. With the next frontier in cancer immunotherapy within reach, investors will be laser focused on the performance of Merck's Keytruda, after Bristol-Myers reported strong quarterly growth for rival drug Opdivo last week. Considered Merck's most significant growth driver, Wall Street is hoping for signs that Keytruda and other drugs in the company's pipeline will be enough to offset patent expirations on many key products.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc, the conglomerate run by billionaire Warren Buffett, is expected to report first-quarter results on Friday after U.S. markets close. The results are to be issued one day before Berkshire holds its annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger are expected for five hours to answer questions from shareholders, investors and analysts on Saturday, the centerpiece of a weekend of events throughout the city.

Time Warner Inc, which is being bought by AT&T, is expected to report a rise in first-quarter revenue on Wednesday, helped by the success of its movies 'Kong' and 'The Lego Batman Movie' as well as higher cable revenues. In January, AT&T said it expected to be able to bypass the U.S. FCC in its planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner because it would not seek to transfer any significant Time Warner licenses.

Tesla Inc is scheduled to report first-quarter results on Wednesday after markets close. Shortly after, Chief Executive Elon Musk is scheduled to hold an investor call.

Mondelez International Inc's first quarter profit is likely to beat analysts' estimates on Tuesday, helped by cost cuts through its zero-based budgeting plan. Mondelez has targeted cost savings of 30-50 percent in 12 areas, including travel, sales support services and business events. Investors will look forward to the company's 2017 profit forecast to know the efficacy of its cost-cutting plan. Separately, Kraft Heinz Co's quarterly revenue growth is likely to have slowed as the company has been forced to adjust its products as shoppers increasingly shun packaged foods for fresher items and those perceived to be healthier. However, Kraft Heinz, reporting on Wednesday, has also been benefiting from lower prices of raw materials, including dairy products and coffee, which is likely to lift its quarterly profit. Investors will be looking forward to any news about the company's strategy in the near future and its 2017 profit and revenue forecasts as its bid to take over Anglo-Dutch company Unilever recently fell apart.

ConocoPhillips, the largest independent oil company in the United States, is expected to swing to a quarterly profit on Tuesday, helped by the rise in oil prices. Conoco has been selling assets to reduce its exposure to profit-sapping natural gas assets and to shore up its balance sheet. Investors will seek details of the company's plans to sell assets worth $17 billion to Cenovus Energy - a transaction that has irked investors of the Canadian company, who have complained that the deal price is too high. Oil and gas producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp is expected to post a smaller quarterly loss on Tuesday, buoyed by rising oil prices. The company set a higher capital budget for the year in March to focus on higher-margin oil production. Investors will seek details of the company's drilling plans for the year. Occidental Petroleum Corp is expected to report a smaller quarterly profit on Thursday as high costs outweigh gains from a rise in crude prices. Occidental, which has cut its budget for the year, has been focusing on Texas' prolific Permian basin. Analysts and investors seek details on the company's plans to reduce costs.

Humana Inc reports first-quarter earnings before the bell on Wednesday. The health insurer, which has pre-announced its first-quarter profit, is likely to benefit from strength in its Medicare Advantage business. Investors will watch out for comments about President Donald Trump's plan to revamp the U.S. healthcare system. Humana has said it would exit Obamacare business in 2018. Aetna Inc, the No. 3 U.S. health insurer, is scheduled to report its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, followed by Cigna Corp on Friday, before the market opens. Cigna is also waiting for a decision from a federal appeals court, which had been asked to rule on whether the Justice Department could stop Cigna and Anthem Inc's $54 billion merger on antitrust grounds.

IT services provider Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp is expected to report a rise in first-quarter revenue on Friday. The company is benefiting a huge demand for its digital and cloud services. Investors and analysts would be looking out for Cognizant's comments on U.S. President Trump's tough stance on H1-B visa rules. About three-quarters of Cognizant's employees are in India.

CVS Health Corp, a drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager (PBM), lowered its full-year PBM unit revenue growth forecast, which analysts partly attributed to branded drug price increases coming in lower than anticipated. CVS said in March it had lost a contract to manage specialty drug benefits for the Federal Employee Program to Prime Therapeutics. Traffic in its stores is also expected to have been weak in the quarter. The company will report on Tuesday. Separately, drug wholesaler AmerisourceBergen Corp will report first-quarter earnings before the market opens on Thursday. Pharmaceutical supply chain, including pharmacy benefit managers and drug distributors, have been squeezed as a result of pricing pressure due to heightened scrutiny over drug price hikes. Investors will also focus on pricing commentary related to independent pharmacy networks.

Viacom Inc, the owner of MTV, Comedy Central and the Paramount film studio, is seen reporting a fall in quarterly profit on Thursday. The company has faced several quarters of declines in domestic advertising revenue as it grapples with shifting audience preferences. CEO Bakish is making Paramount a major part of his strategy to turn around the media conglomerate's declining ad revenue and ratings. Separately on the same day, CBS Corp, owner of the most widely-viewed U.S. television network, is expected to post a drop in first-quarter revenue, in part due to a strong year-ago quarter that benefited from the 2016 Super Bowl and political ad spend.

Yum Brands Inc's Pizza Hut chain is expected to continue its string of falling same-store sales, while rival Domino's reported a better-than-expected 14 percent jump in U.S. comparable sales. However, Taco Bell is expected to have benefited from promotions, while KFC is expected to have had steady growth. Yum Brands is scheduled to report its results on Wednesday. Dunkin Brands Group Inc, the owner of Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin Robbins, issued a conservative 2017 forecast in February, forecasting low single-digit comparable U.S. sales growth for both the chains. Dunkin' is streamlining its menus to speed up service, reducing waste and could potentially reduce staff turnover by making employees' work easier. The company is expected to report on Thursday. Sprint Corp is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Wednesday. The wireless carrier is expected to post a rise in profit as it benefits from revamped plans that offer unlimited data. Investors and analysts will be looking out for any comments on a potential deal with rival T-Mobile.

Akamai Technologies Inc is expected to report a rise in first-quarter revenue, driven by strong demand for its security services. However, Akamai has been experiencing continued slowdown in its media delivery business after some of its large customers shifted to their own delivery networks, and this could hurt the company's future revenue. The company is scheduled to report on Tuesday. On the same day, FireEye Inc is expected to report its second straight fall in quarterly revenue. The cybersecurity company has been struggling to regain momentum in a highly competitive market and is also coping with a string of executive departures. The company is also shifting to a subscription-based revenue model, which is expected to lead to more stable revenue streams in the future.

Kellogg Co, the world's largest maker of breakfast cereals, has seen its profits rise due to restructuring program, "Project K", launched to counter slowing sales as Americans choose healthier options over processed foods. Investors will look out for additional cost-cutting actions under the program. The company is expected to report first-quarter results on Thursday.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, which is facing slowing sales of its blockbuster eye drug Eylea, is expected to report first-quarter results before the bell on Thursday. Investors will be looking for comments on company's potential blockbuster treatments Dupixent and Sarilumab, as the U.S. biotech reduces reliance on Eylea. Investors will also seek details on the company and partner Sanofi SA' patent war against Amgen Inc for its cholestrol drug Praluent and eczema treatment Dupixent. Separately on Tuesday, Gilead Sciences Inc, maker of HIV and hepatitis treatments, is scheduled to report first-quarter results.

Chesapeake Energy Corp, the second-largest U.S. natural gas producer, is expected to swing to a quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by improved oil and gas prices. Investors will look for an update on the company's plans to accelerate its debt reduction target of $2 billion-$3 billion over the next few years through additional asset sales. On the same day, Apache Corp is expected to swing to a quarterly profit, also bolstered by higher crude prices. The company set a higher spending target for 2017 earlier this year, encouraged by the price recovery. Investors will seek details on Apache's drilling plans for the year. Offshore drilling contractor Noble Corp Plc is expected to post a quarterly loss on Thursday, compared with a year-ago profit, as customer spending on expensive offshore projects remains weak. Investors will seek details of the company's order book and efforts to cut costs amid the prolonged slump in demand. On Tuesday, Devon Energy Corp is expected to report a first-quarter profit, compared with a year-ago loss, as rising oil prices boost cash flows. Investors will seek details of the company's drilling plans for the year.

HCA Holdings Inc, the largest U.S. for-profit hospital operator, reports first-quarter results before the bell on Tuesday. HCA, which pre-announced part of its results, is expected to report soft volumes due to weak hospital operating environment. Investors will watch out for comments on the likely impact of on hospital operators from the Trump administration's plan to overhaul the U.S. healthcare system.

Videogame publisher Activision Blizzard Inc is expected to report a rise in quarterly revenue and profit on Thursday, helped by higher digital downloads of its games and its acquisition of Candy Crush maker King Digital. Activision Blizzard recently unveiled the latest installment of its popular Call of Duty franchise, set around events in World War II and characters such as Nazi Zombies. After the disappointing performance of 2016's game, analysts and investors will be closely watching any commentary from Activision and player's responses to gauge how the game will be received when it releases in late 2017. Zynga Inc is expected to report a rise in quarterly revenue on Thursday, helped by its popular franchises including Zynga Poker and Words With Friends. Advertising revenue from its games in the period is expected to be typically lean, but analysts are looking beyond the quarter to see what Zynga's game slate for 2017 is like.

On Tuesday, agricultural trader Archer Daniels Midland will report first-quarter earnings amid abundant global grain stocks that have lowered costs for the raw materials it processes into vegetable oil, corn sweetener and ethanol. But the plentiful crop supplies have also squeezed trading margins and the company has been shedding traders around the world. Separately on Wednesday, Bunge Ltd will report first-quarter results. Investors will be watching for clues on crop marketing in Brazil and Argentina, where farmers are harvesting bumper corn and soy crops, as a large share of Bunge's assets are in South America.

First Solar Inc is expected to report a first-quarter loss on Tuesday, compared with a year-ago profit, as it transitions to a new product ahead of schedule. Solar companies have been struggling with a sharp decline in panel prices since mid-2016, but the company said in February that bookings had picked up since the end of last year. Analysts and investors will look for comments on panel pricing and demand.

On Wednesday, New York Times Co is expected to report a drop in first-quarter profit, hurt by higher operating costs. However, the magazine and newspaper publisher has been ramping up its digital business to offset its declining print sales.

On Tuesday, U.S.-based fertilizer maker Mosaic Co is expected to post a bigger first-quarter profit, as potash prices modestly rebound. Investors will be interested in any updates on Mosaic's acquisition of Vale's fertilizer assets. On Wednesday, U.S. nitrogen fertilizer producer CF Industries reports first-quarter results. Of interest to investors are the company's thoughts on new U.S. production coming online this year, which could weigh on prices.

Estee Lauder Cos Inc is scheduled to report third-quarter results on Wednesday. The cosmetics maker has been struggling with low mall traffic in the United States as shoppers increasingly prefer to buy personal products online. Investors will look out for comments on tourist spending, both within the U.S. and in major international markets. Handbag maker Coach Inc is expected to report a dip in third-quarter sales on the same day. The company has been battling rising competition and increased discounting. Coach, in a push to regain its premium tag, has tightened inventory and cut back on promotions in North America.

Fitbit Inc is expected to post its second straight fall in quarterly revenue on Wednesday as the fitness band maker grapples with waning demand for its fitness tracking bands in a maturing market. Analysts and investors will be on the looking out for a new product cycle.

Denver-based Molson Coors Brewing Co is expected to report a jump in quarterly sales and profit, helped by its $12 billion acquisition last year of the remaining 58 percent of MillerCoors from beer giant SABMiller. The deal made Molson Coors, known for its flagship Coors Light brew, the third-largest brewer in the world. A strong U.S. dollar, which is expected to stay strong, will likely have tempered earnings and investors will look for any currency impact down the line.

TransCanada Corp reports first-quarter results and holds its annual general meeting on Friday. Investors will be looking for updates on shipper commitments on its recently approved Keystone XL crude oil pipeline, which is still awaiting route approval in Nebraska.

Home Capital Group, Canada biggest non-bank lender, is scheduled to report first-quarter results on Wednesday. On Thursday, Ontario's financial regulator hears a case against the company, whose shares fell 50 percent and which is looking at strategic options.

On Friday, Air Canada Inc is expected to report a quarterly loss, compared with a year-ago profit, hurt by a rise in costs. Investors will seek details of its plans to upgrade its fleet with fuel-efficient aircraft.

Encana Corp, Canada's No. 2 oil and natural gas producer, is expected to swing to a quarterly profit, helped by higher oil prices. Investors will look for details on the company's drilling plans for the year when it reports on Tuesday. In recent years Encana has narrowed operations to focus on four core North American plays: the Montney and Duvernay in Western Canada, and the Eagle Ford and Permian in the United States. Separately, Husky Energy Inc is expected to post a quarterly profit on Friday, compared with a year-ago loss, as it sells more crude oil at higher prices. Investors will seek details on the company's drilling plans for the year.

Loblaw Companies Ltd, a Canadian grocery and pharmacy retailer, is expected to report a higher first-quarter profit on Wednesday as its cost-cutting efforts pay off. The company has been streamlining operations to counter intense competition from U.S. discount stores and ecommerce companies. Analysts and investors will look for comments on pricing and further cost cuts.

Torstar Corp, the owner of one of Canada's largest circulation daily newspapers, is expected to post a smaller first-quarter loss on Wednesday as a growing digital business offsets declines in its print ads. Torstar's plans to grow its digital business will be of interest to investors.

Canadian gold miner Kinross Gold Corp is expected to report flat earnings on Tuesday, which is likely to include a gain from the recent sale of its stake in the Cerro Casale project in Chile.

A decision on that is expected in the third quarter.

Shopify Inc, a Canadian ecommerce software maker, is expected to post a bigger quarterly loss on Tuesday as operating expenses rise.

ON MONDAY - MAY 1

Cardinal Health will report its third-quarter results before the market opens. The results come a week after the drug distributor said it would buy Medtronic Plc's medical supplies units for $6.1 billion to add heft to its growing medical products business. The move was, however, overshadowed by the company's dour forecast, underscoring the U.S. drug distribution industry's struggles with declining generic drug prices.

Debt-laden hospital operators Community Health and Tenet Healthcare will report first-quarter results after market close.

UPDATE 3-Cenovus faces investor displeasure after ConocoPhillips deal - 路透新闻

{{20170426T235152.642+0000}}UPDATE 3-Cenovus faces investor displeasure after ConocoPhillips deal(Recasts with results of shareholder vote)

By Ethan Lou

CALGARY, Alberta, April 26 (Reuters) - Cenovus Energy Inc won about 87 percent of shareholders' votes for its board of director slate on Wednesday, below previous near-unanimous approvals, as some voters protested the company's C$17 billion ($12.6 billion) purchase of ConocoPhillips assets.

The deal, announced in March, effectively doubled the size of the Canadian oil company, but wiped out about a fifth of its market value, with some investors complaining that the price was too high. [nL1N1HX13U]

Even as Cenovus posted better-than-expected first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, questions about the deal and Cenovus' ability to execute it dogged a conference call about the results and the shareholders meeting later that day.

A shareholder who wanted to be known only as Bernie told management: "If you guys are so confident on the deal, why don't shareholders have the opportunity to vote?"

Investors had been "left out in the cold," he said. "I very much resent that."

Chairman Michael Grandin responded that the "once-in-a-lifetime" deal required confidentiality for negotiations that a shareholder vote would deny.

Chief Executive Brian Ferguson said the Deep Basin natural gas asset bought from ConocoPhillips, which some investors said was incompatible with Cenovus' oil business, was "absolutely core" to the company and could be its "crown jewel."

Cenovus could reduce spending on Deep Basin to focus on oil sands, and also sell part of that natural gas asset, he added.

Ferguson told media after the meeting that the roughly 87 percent vote tally reflected confidence in the deal, which is expected to close in the second quarter.

Cenovus plans to fund the deal partly through divestitures, mainly of its Suffield and Pelican Lake conventional oil and gas assets.

The company will provide more details on those in the third quarter, Ferguson said earlier on Wednesday.

Cenovus reported a C$211 million ($155.54 million) profit in the quarter ended March 31, helped by lower operating costs and higher production. Net profit was 25 Canadian cents per share, compared with a loss of C$118 million, or 14 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier. [nCCN7Z6bqm]

Operating loss was 5 Canadian cents per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of a loss of 8 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

Cenovus said operating costs for its oil sands fell 6 percent to C$8.97 per barrel, while total oil production rose about 19 percent to 234,914 barrels per day. ($1 = 1.3566 Canadian dollars)

PREVIEW-Cenovus earnings overshadowed by unpopular ConocoPhillips deal - 路透新闻

{{20170424T195118.372+0000}}PREVIEW-Cenovus earnings overshadowed by unpopular ConocoPhillips dealBy Ethan Lou and John Tilak

CALGARY, Alberta/TORONTO, April 24 (Reuters) - As Cenovus Energy Inc prepares to release first-quarter earnings this week, investors are looking for answers about a recent C$17 billion ($12.6 billion) acquisition that wiped out about a fifth of its market value.

Disgruntled shareholders will grill Cenovus at an annual meeting on Wednesday following results about its purchase of most of ConocoPhillips' Canadian oil and gas assets.

The deal ramped up Cenovus debt and pushed it into the largely unknown territory of natural gas, effectively doubling the size of the Canadian oil company.[nL1N1HJ17N]

Some investors have questioned whether Cenovus overpaid for the assets at a time when foreign oil majors are retreating from the high-cost and heavily regulated Canadian oil sands industry.[nL3N1H65JB]

"It's very much going to be a show-me story," said Mike O'Brien, managing director and head of the Core Canadian Equity team at TD Asset Management, a shareholder. While the deal's long-term logic is sound, it is still a question of whether the company can properly execute its plan, he said.

Analysts expect Cenovus to post a loss of C$0.09 per share for the January-March quarter, compared with a C$0.14 per share loss a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. The company had higher-than-expected production for the first quarter and benefited from higher oil prices, Royal Bank of Canada analysts said.

DIVERSIFICATION

Apart from the debt taken to fund the ConocoPhillips deal, investors are concerned about Cenovus' move to diversify into natural gas with the purchase of Deep Basin assets and its ability to divest to pay for the assets.

Benoit Gervais, portfolio manager at Mackenzie Investments, which owns Cenovus shares, said the company had no history or track record in conventional gas. "I estimate they've overpaid by about C$5 billion," he said.

Cenovus shares fell 13.8 percent last month on news of the deal in their biggest ever single-day drop. The stock has since fallen another 5.6 percent.

Buying Deep Basin flies in the face of the very identity of Cenovus, which was spun-off from predecessor Encana Corp to focus on crude, said one investor, who spoke on condition of anonymity as the person was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue.

Still, the deal has some backers. Canada's oil-rich Alberta province, which holds a position in Cenovus through a government investment firm, said the company remained a good bet.

Asked about investor concerns, a Cenovus spokesman referred to Chief Executive Brian Ferguson's comments this month that the company had a "solid plan" to finance the transaction and cut debt using increased cash flow and assets sales.

Cenovus may sell parts of Deep Basin, RBC analysts said, a move that would please investors who balked at the purchase. [nL1N1HV0HX]

While the transaction itself does not require a vote, some shareholders may use Wednesday's meeting to express opposition to the deal by voting against company nominations for the board of directors.

Cenovus reports earnings the same week as other Canadian crude producers including Suncor Energy Inc , Crescent Point Energy Corp and Exxon Mobil Corp-owned Imperial Oil Ltd .

RPT-Cenovus may sell parts of acquired natgas assets -analysts - 路透新闻

{{20170424T122403.281+0000}}RPT-Cenovus may sell parts of acquired natgas assets -analysts(Repeats with no change to text)

CALGARY, Alberta, April 24 (Reuters) - Canada's Cenovus Energy Inc has said it may sell parts of the Deep Basin natural gas assets it recently bought from Houston-based ConocoPhillips , Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) analysts wrote in a research note on Sunday.

Cenovus Chief Executive Brian Ferguson held a conference call with analysts last Friday, and the oil company "signaled that it would also be open to potentially monetizing some portion of the Deep Basin midstream assets," according to the note.

"Cenovus has had seven inbound calls from CEOs of various energy companies looking to ensure the company is aware of their interest in certain Deep Basin assets," the analysts wrote.

RBC acted as an advisor for Cenovus for the ConocoPhillips deal.

Cenovus did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The C$17.7-billion ($13.3-billion) acquisition last month of ConocoPhillips oil and gas assets effectively doubles the size of Cenovus. But the deal dents the company's pristine balance sheet and saddles the pure-play crude producer with Deep Basin natural gas assets that some investors and analysts have said it has no business holding.

Cenovus shares crashed last month in their biggest single-day drop on news of the deal, which is to be funded through debt and selling shares and what the company deems to be "non-core" assets.

"Select assets within the Deep Basin could be tagged as non-core," according to the RBC note. "This was new to us and opens up interesting de-leveraging possibilities for Cenovus."

While the company had wanted to raise C$3.6 billion through asset sales, it may end up raising more, according to the note.

Cenovus may sell parts of acquired natgas assets -analysts - 路透新闻

{{20170423T200812.205+0000}}Cenovus may sell parts of acquired natgas assets -analystsCALGARY, Alberta, April 23 (Reuters) - Canada's Cenovus Energy Inc has said it may sell parts of the Deep Basin natural gas assets it recently bought from Houston-based ConocoPhillips , Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) analysts wrote in a research note on Sunday.

Cenovus Chief Executive Brian Ferguson held a conference call with analysts last Friday, and the oil company "signaled that it would also be open to potentially monetizing some portion of the Deep Basin midstream assets," according to the note.

"Cenovus has had seven inbound calls from CEOs of various energy companies looking to ensure the company is aware of their interest in certain Deep Basin assets," the analysts wrote.

RBC acted as an advisor for Cenovus for the ConocoPhillips deal.

Cenovus did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The C$17.7-billion ($13.3-billion) acquisition last month of ConocoPhillips oil and gas assets effectively doubles the size of Cenovus. But the deal dents the company's pristine balance sheet and saddles the pure-play crude producer with Deep Basin natural gas assets that some investors and analysts have said it has no business holding.

Cenovus shares crashed last month in their biggest single-day drop on news of the deal, which is to be funded through debt and selling shares and what the company deems to be "non-core" assets.

"Select assets within the Deep Basin could be tagged as non-core," according to the RBC note. "This was new to us and opens up interesting de-leveraging possibilities for Cenovus."

While the company had wanted to raise C$3.6 billion through asset sales, it may end up raising more, according to the note.

Canada to delay implementing new methane norms by 3 years - CBC News  - 路透新闻

{{20170421T054127.267+0000}}Canada to delay implementing new methane norms by 3 years - CBC News April 21 (Reuters) - Canada's federal government wants to delay the implementation of its new methane regulations by up to three years to 2020 and expects to fully implement it by 2023, CBC News reported on Thursday.

The initial plan was to begin introducing rules to control methane emissions from the oil and gas industry in 2018, with all the new regulations in place by 2020, CBC News said, citing documents. (http://bit.ly/2oWVyE9)

The move is a departure from the commitments made by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and former U.S. President Barack Obama to cut emissions of methane by 40 to 45 percent below 2012 levels by 2025. [nL1N16I0JP]

The amended timeline was a result of discussions between the government and stakeholders and will be incorporated into the proposed regulations expected to be announced at the end of April, CBS News reported.

Major oil producers like ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell have cut their exposure to Canada's oil sands operations, which are among the world's most expensive oil plays to develop.

Faced with a lower oil price environment and challenging economics, which include high cost operations and carbon taxes, global players are increasingly put off by the oil sands.

BP Plc is also considering the sale of its stakes in three Canadian oil sands projects, Reuters reported on Thursday. (http://reut.rs/2oWTvAj)

Methane, which can leak from pipelines and valves, is a powerful greenhouse gas, with up to 80 times the potential of carbon dioxide to trap the planet's heat.

In February, the U.S. House of Representatives repealed a rule put forth in the final days of the Obama administration that limited emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane from oil and gas drilling on federal lands. [nW1N18K01I]

UPDATE 1-BP mulls sale of stakes in Canadian oil sands assets -sources - 路透新闻

{{20170420T184342.938+0000}}UPDATE 1-BP mulls sale of stakes in Canadian oil sands assets -sources(Adds details on past oil sands sales, potential Husky interest)

By John Tilak and Nia Williams

TORONTO/CALGARY, April 20 (Reuters) - BP Plc is considering the sale of its stakes in three Canadian oil sands projects, people familiar with the matter told Reuters this week, as part of the British oil company's strategy of retreating from noncore businesses.

BP's 50 percent stake in the Sunrise project near Fort McMurray in Alberta, where Husky Energy Inc owns the rest and is the operator, is the most valuable of the three assets. BP'S Sunrise stake is valued at about $810 million, based on recent transactions in the sector.

It also owns a 50 percent stake in Pike, operated by Devon Energy Corp , which is still awaiting a final investment decision, and is majority-owner of the Terre de Grace oil sands pilot project.

A BP spokesman declined to comment. Sources declined to be named as the information is confidential.

The three projects are located in northeastern Alberta.

BP has discussed with advisers the possibility of selling the stakes, though no final decision has been made, the people added.

If the sale proceeds, BP would deploy capital in more attractive regions, such as the Permian basin in the United States, where the rate of return tends to be higher, one of the people said.

BP's planned move comes after other global energy majors, including ConocoPhillips and Royal Dutch Shell have cut their exposure to Canada's oil sands operations, which are among the world's most expensive oil plays to develop. [nL5N1GM1VZ]

Faced with a lower oil price environment and challenging economics, which include high cost operations and carbon taxes, global players are increasingly put off by the oil sands.

Reuters reported last week that U.S. oil producer Chevron Corp was exploring the sale of its 20 percent stake in Canada's Athabasca Oil Sands project, which could fetch about $2.5 billion. [nL1N1HL0PQ]

BP is focusing its operations in Egypt, Azerbaijan, the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and Trinidad in the coming years.

Husky said in February that current production at the Sunrise project is about 36,000 barrels of oil per day. It is in the process of ramping up the project to full capacity of 60,000 bpd but progress has been slower than expected and the company is drilling extra wells to try to speed up production. Husky lowered the 2017 production forecast to 40,000-44,000 bpd from 60,000 bpd.

While Husky is not keen to increase its exposure to the oil sands, it may consider buying BP's stake if the price is attractive, two sources said.

Husky spokesman Mel Duvall declined to comment on whether the company had discussed buying BP's stake in Sunrise.

"We take a look at everything, but we have a number of organic growth opportunities," he added. ($1 = 1.3475 Canadian dollars)

HOUSTON, April 20 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips has beaten its 2017 asset sales target less than four months into the year, after shedding $30.8 billion worth of energy assets in six years.

But instead of a chorus of cheers on Wall Street, Chief Executive Ryan Lance is facing investor skepticism that the company can deliver growth from remaining oil and gas fields.

ConocoPhillips' most recent sales of Canadian oil-sands properties and U.S. natural gas wells for a combined $16 billion will part with nearly 30 percent of its proved reserves in order to deliver near-term shareholder payouts and pare debt. For a graphic, click http://tmsnrt.rs/2pKHtZQ

Lance told Reuters the sales to Cenovus Energy and Hilcorp Energy Co will fulfill promises to reduce long-term debt by 42 percent to $15 billion, fund $6 billion in share purchases and help reshape the company for an era of low and volatile energy prices.

Drilling in two shale regions should help restore falling U.S. output by the fourth quarter.

"I don't worry about production and reserves in the company," he told Reuters in an interview, citing oil and gas fields that could be upgraded to proved reserves over time.

ConocoPhillips can achieve flat to 2 percent annual production growth on its properties, after adjustments for sales, and deliver shareholder payouts, he said.

But interviews with portfolio managers, former employees and industry analysts point to the frequent sales as a short-term fix. They worry ConocoPhillips' plan for modest production growth, flat capital spending and steady shareholder payouts pales in comparison to rivals that have retooled themselves to deliver sharply higher growth rates.

The danger of its reliance on fewer assets was driven home in recent weeks as a fire at a supplier hurt its ability to ship crude from oil-sands properties.[nL2N1HC1PW]

Mike Breard, who tracks energy stocks for Hodges Capital Management, said the strategy lacks appeal.

"If I wanted yield, I'd buy something else. If I wanted growth, I buy something else. I just don't see what customers would want to be in that in-between situation," Breard said.

The Houston company projects its daily production of crude and natural gas will fall 26 percent after the latest sales to about 1.16 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe). Barclays expects overall it won't return to production growth on a full-year basis until 2019.

"They've sold a very valuable asset," said Marc Heilweil, senior portfolio manager at Atlanta-based investment firm Gratus Capital, referring to the oil-sands holdings.

The deal will "make it harder for them to fully replace reserves down the line" because shale-oil properties have shorter productive lives, he said.

To ensure growth, oil producers must continually add reserves to offset production and the natural decline that occurs in oil-and-gas properties.

In 2012, ConocoPhillips spun off its refining business, leaving the ranks of the large, integrated companies like Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp , and putting it among a group of mostly-small U.S. independent exploration and production companies.

Lance, who was the company's technology chief, became ConocoPhillips' chairman and CEO upon the spin off. He pledged to boost output by 3 percent to 5 percent annually by tapping its large pool of deep-water, oil-sands and conventional oil-and-gas properties. That goal ended two years later as prices collapsed, forcing it to borrow heavily to cover its spending on production. ConocoPhillips later cut its dividend.

Its lack of exposure to refining has helped its shares stand out recently. The company's stock is down 4.3 percent year to date, even after an about 9 percent jump following the March 29 disclosure of a $3 billion addition to its share buy backs. In contrast, Chevron is 11.5 percent lower and Exxon is off about 10.8 percent in the same period.

Of analysts with published ratings on the stock, 7 rate it a strong buy, 11 rate it a buy and 6 rate it a hold. That compares to Chevron with 6 strong buy ratings, 12 buy ratings and 3 hold ratings.

VALUE FROM SHALE

Last fall, Lance recast ConocoPhillips as an energy company able to offer steady shareholder returns on flat production spending of about $5 billion a year. It shaved its growth target to as much 2 percent, instead of up to 5 percent, and promised 20 percent to 30 percent of operating cash flow would go to holders via dividends and buy backs.

He insists the remaining assets can generate substantial cash from operations even if oil falls below $40 a barrel. ConocoPhillips is ramping up output from its Eagle Ford and Bakken shale wells, from another oil-sands property and liquefied natural gas (LNG) from operations in Australia.

Meanwhile, rivals have cranked up their production much faster. U.S. shale-focused companies project 15 percent volume growth this year, says consultancy Wood Mackenzie, and the larger oil producers such as Chevron are raising output and delivering fatter dividends.

ConocoPhillips will be producing an average 1.25 million boe a day in 2019, estimates Barclays. In contrast, Chevron projects its daily output this year will rise between 103,000 boe and 233,000 boe over 2016's average 2.59 million boe, excluding divestitures. Chevron pays a 4 percent dividend.

The risk for ConocoPhillips investors is the growth in production doesn't generate higher free cash flow for share buy backs, and the 2 percent dividend yield, about half that of Chevron, becomes the bigger part of returns.

Henry Smith, co-chief investment officer at Haverford Trust, which invests in companies offering revenue growth and dividend gains, sold ConocoPhillips shares ahead of its 2016 dividend cut and has not been tempted back by the new strategy.

ConocoPhillips' pledge to deliver steady returns and growth is appealing, said Smith. But, he added: "Exxon over the years has fit that bill." Haverford's oil-industry holdings are Exxon Mobil Corp , Chevron and Schlumberger NV , he said.

Tom Bergeron, an equity analyst at Frost Bank, also prefers other oil producers such as Chevron and Occidental Petroleum Corp for what he said is their expected growth and their higher dividend yields.

Lance, who worked summers as an oilfield roughneck while studying petroleum engineering in Montana, said he understands investors want proof the company can deliver regular payouts without the asset sales.

"It'll probably take performance through a cycle to demonstrate we have the position and the passion to deliver," he said, referring to the industry's boom and bust periods.

ConocoPhillips, partners weigh expansion of Darwin LNG - 路透新闻

{{20170419T081627.955+0000}}ConocoPhillips, partners weigh expansion of Darwin LNGDARWIN, April 19 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips and its partners are considering expanding their Darwin liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in Australia, with backing from other companies with undeveloped gas resources that could feed the plant.

ConocoPhillips has previously talked only about developing a new gas field for around $10 billion to fill the plant's single production unit, or train, when supply from its current gas source, the Bayu-Undan field, runs out around 2022. [nL4N1G002G]

The U.S. oil major has also previously said an expansion in the current market would be challenging due to low oil and LNG prices, and costs that have risen steeply since Darwin LNG was built more than a decade ago.

A $650,000 feasibility study on building a second train is due to be completed this year, the Northern Territory government said on Wednesday, announcing that it would contribute $250,000 towards the study.

"The Territory Labor Government is supporting the feasibility study because this is a significant investment towards the business case for potential expansion at Darwin LNG, potentially creating thousands of jobs during construction and operation," Northern Territory Chief Minister Michael Gunner said in a statement.

Five joint ventures with undeveloped gas resources off the coast of the Northern Territory are backing the study, with stakeholders including Royal Dutch Shell , Malaysia's Petronas [PETR.UL], Italy's ENI SpA , and Australia's Santos and Origin Energy .

"With Darwin LNG, five upstream joint ventures and the Northern Territory Government involved, it is a pioneering example of all of industry and government collaborating on solutions to unlock major investments," ConocoPhillips Australia West vice president Kayleen Ewin said in a statement.

Darwin LNG is co-owned by ConocoPhillips, Santos, Japan's Inpex <1605.T>, ENI, Tokyo Electric Power Co <9501.T> and Tokyo Gas Co <9531.T>.

UPDATE 1-ConocoPhillips sells San Juan basin assets for $3 bln - 路透新闻

{{20170413T120155.743+0000}}UPDATE 1-ConocoPhillips sells San Juan basin assets for $3 bln(Adds details, background)

April 13 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips , the largest U.S. independent oil producer, said on Thursday it would sell natural gas-heavy assets in San Juan basin to privately held Hilcorp Energy Co for about $3 billion.

ConocoPhillips has been selling assets to reduce its exposure to profit-sapping natural gas assets and shore up its balance sheet.

The assets, which span New Mexico and Southwestern Colorado, produced 124,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, about 80 percent of which was natural gas, ConocoPhillips said.

Conoco said last month it would sell oil sands and western Canadian natural gas assets to Cenovus Energy Inc for $13.3 billion. [nL3N1H65JB]

Conoco will receive $2.7 billion in cash from the San Juan basin asset sale, which is expected to close in the third quarter. [nBw39p2hGa]

The deal also includes a contingent payment of up to $300 million.

Conoco, which said the assets being sold had a book value of about $5.9 billion at 2016-end, expects to record an impairment charge in the second quarter.

Houston-based Hilcorp has a partnership with private equity firm Carlyle Group LP to acquire and develop North American oil and gas properties.

THE GLOBE AND MAIL

** A landmark deal between TransCanada Corp and Western Canadian natural gas companies for discounted, long-distance pipeline transport comes "just in time" to help stave off some competition from increasing U.S. production, says one of the key backers of the agreement. https://tgam.ca/2p4Zs0j

** British Columbia Liberal Leader Christy Clark has launched the 41st general election in British Columbia, laying out a simple campaign theme that she is counting on voters to favour on May 9 – that only her party will keep the province's economy strong and job opportunities growing. https://tgam.ca/2p4TcWw

** Canadian oil producers are confident in Alberta's oil sands projects as a long-term play, betting that consolidation and a homegrown focus will drive down operating costs and make the industry more competitive as foreign players retreat. https://tgam.ca/2p4HhI1

NATIONAL POST

** Cenovus Energy Inc CEO Brian Ferguson says the company is encouraged by the interest in its asset divestiture plan to fund part of the mega C$17.7 billion ($13.29 billion)deal to buy ConocoPhillips' Canadian assets, which should help improve investor sentiment around the acquisition. http://bit.ly/2p4YRf4

** Pembina Pipeline Corp plans to build a propane export terminal in Prince Rupert, British Columbia where major liquefied natural gas export projects have stalled in recent years. http://bit.ly/2p4HIlD

** Canadian oilsands producers worried about international capital fleeing to the U.S. should take heart from the long-term attractiveness of the reserves, according to a senior think-tank advisor. http://bit.ly/2p4Ti0t

Waterous PE firm targets Canadian, U.S. energy assets - Reuters News

{{20170411T212331.839+0000}}Waterous PE firm targets Canadian, U.S. energy assetsBy John Tilak

TORONTO, April 11 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Waterous Energy Fund is seeking investment opportunities in the Canadian oil and gas sector as valuations turn attractive after a prolonged slump in the oil price, making a contrarian bet as global players pull back, its top executive said.

Calgary-based Waterous Energy, which invests C$100 million to C$400 million ($75 million to $300 million) per deal in energy assets, is targeting companies in Canada and the United States, and is finding Canada particularly appealing, said Adam Waterous, head of Waterous Energy and a former top investment banker at Bank of Nova Scotia .

Waterous Energy agreed to pay about C$244 million for a 67 percent stake in Canadian energy company Northern Blizzard Resources Inc from U.S. private equity firms Riverstone Holdings LLC and NGP Energy Capital Management LLC. This marks the second deal for Waterous Energy, which already has committed C$650 million since setting up shop earlier this year.

Northern Blizzard shares ended the day up 5.1 percent.

The Waterous acquisition is the latest example of Canada-focused firms buying into the country's energy sector and comes as international energy players exit the market.

"The macro theme playing out is the 'Canadianization' of the heavy oil business," Waterous said in an interview. "These assets tend to be very capital intensive upfront but once they're onstream they have long reserve life and tend to have high free cash flow. From a Canadian investor's perspective, that's really compelling."

Last month, ConocoPhillips said it would sell oil sands and natural gas assets to Calgary-based Cenovus Energy for C$17.2 billion, while Canadian Natural Resources Ltd is snapping up billions of dollars worth of oil sands assets from Royal Dutch Shell and Marathon Oil Corp . [nL2N1GM20K] [nL3N1H65JB]

Oil prices have lost about 50 percent of their value since June 2014, when the industry slump began. They are almost flat since the start of the year.

"The market is saying the sun has set on the oil business," Waterous said. "I'm willing to bet against that."

Waterous said his firm was looking for assets with long reserve lives in top quartile reservoirs, where advanced technology techniques could be used.

"I find the environment right now to be very compelling. You've got a pessimistic market, you've got low costs in Calgary and you've got new technology being developed," he said.

For Waterous Energy, private Canadian energy producer Strath Resources Ltd was its first investment.

UPDATE 2-Cenovus CEO seeks backing as bold bet and market jitters test his legacy - 路透新闻

{{20170411T194817.562+0000}}UPDATE 2-Cenovus CEO seeks backing as bold bet and market jitters test his legacy(New throughout, adds comments from people close to chief executive)

By Ethan Lou and Nia Williams

TORONTO, April 11 (Reuters) - Cenovus Energy Inc will do more hedging after its acquisition of ConocoPhillips assets, the Canadian company's Chief Executive Brian Ferguson said on Tuesday as he mounted a charm offensive on investors who balked at the deal.

Ferguson is known as a low-key and conservative chief executive in the western Canadian oil patch, and his C$17.7-billion ($13.3-billion) bid last month for the assets of ConocoPhillips, the latest international player to exit the country, had confounded investors and analysts.

The deal, which effectively doubles the size of Cenovus while denting its pristine balance sheet and making it more exposed to changes in oil prices, is seen as a test for Ferguson's legacy. The 60-year-old has been with the company and its predecessor for most of his life.

"When we close the transaction, we would definitely be adding more hedge volumes," Ferguson said at an industry event in Toronto, where he was seeking to sell his ambitious plan. Investors last month sent the company's shares crashing in their biggest single-day drop on news of the deal.

Despite a previously strong balance sheet, Cenovus had stayed on the sidelines even as domestic peers eagerly bought assets from retreating foreign oil majors. Eventually, weighed by C$4 billion ($3 billion) cash, Ferguson signed what some analysts and investors said was an uncharacteristic deal.

Ferguson said on Tuesday that the "strategic rationale" for the deal is well understood by investors, although he noted that some have questioned the company's plan for financing it through selling shares, divestitures and taking on debt.

The company has 75 percent of permanent financing in place and has seen strong interest in the assets it is selling, Ferguson said, adding, "We've had multiple inbound inquiries from various sources - private equity funds, pension plans, smaller companies."

Some who know Ferguson well say he has made the right move at the right time.

"When he puts a strategy in place it will be things he sees coming down the road that are perhaps not what other people will see," said Greg Stringham, a former executive with industry association the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers who has known Ferguson for 20 years.

A person close to Cenovus who has known and worked with Ferguson for over two decades said the deal will determine how Ferguson is remembered in the oil patch.

"When you double the size of the company, there will be a jury at some point, whether it is six months from now or six years from now," the person said.

CANADA CRUDE-Heavy grades squeeze tighter on supply concerns - 路透新闻

{{20170410T173146.262+0000}}CANADA CRUDE-Heavy grades squeeze tighter on supply concerns* May WCS trades at $9.50/bbl below WTI

* May synthetic trades at $3.95/bbl above WTI

By Nia Williams

CALGARY, Alberta, April 10 (Reuters) - Canadian heavy crude
differentials surged to a fresh 22-month high on Monday, driven
by uncertainty about how long supply outages in northern
Alberta's oil sands would last.

Western Canada Select heavy blend crude for May delivery
last traded at $9.00 per barrel below the West Texas
Intermediate  benchmark, according to Shorcan Energy
brokers, having settled on Friday at $9.50 per barrel below WTI.

Heavy differentials have tightened dramatically this month
after the Syncrude project in northern Alberta, which produces
350,000 barrels per day of synthetic crude, was forced to cut
April production to zero because of fire in March.

That in turn left producers that mix synthetic crude with
their tarry bitumen to create blended heavy crude struggling to
find supply. Conoco Phillips  and CNOOC Ltd <0883.HK>
subsidiary Nexen cut around 90,000 bpd of production between
them at their oil sands projects as a result, according to
sources. [nL2N1HE1CG]

Traders in Calgary said a hefty chunk of maintenance at
other oil sands projects, including Suncor Energy's 
180,000 Firebag project, was scheduled for May, adding to the
tight supply picture.

One industry source said people were also concerned about
whether export pipeline space out of Alberta would be rationed 
in May, and were buying extra crude in case their pipeline
nominations were cut.

Light synthetic crude from the oil sands for May delivery
last traded at $3.40 per barrel over WTI, weakening slightly
from Friday's settle of $3.75 per barrel over the benchmark.

CANADA CRUDE-Synthetic eases from recent highs  - 路透新闻

{{20170407T153438.087+0000}}CANADA CRUDE-Synthetic eases from recent highs * May WCS trades at $9.50/bbl below WTI

* May synthetic trades at $3.95/bbl above WTI

By Nia Williams

CALGARY, Alberta, April 7 (Reuters) - Canadian synthetic
crude differentials weakened on Friday, retreating off recent
four-year highs, as market players looked ahead to the
restarting of operations at the Syncrude oil sands project in
northern Alberta in the first week of May.

Light synthetic crude from the oil sands for May delivery
last traded at $3.95 per barrel above the West Texas
Intermediate benchmark, according to Shorcan Energy brokers,
having settled at $4.05 per barrel over WTI on Thursday.

Last week, in illiquid trade, synthetic crude settled at
$6.00 a barrel over WTI, the biggest premium since June 2013, on
concerns about reduced supply from Syncrude, one of Canada's
largest single sources of synthetic barrels.

The 350,000 barrel-per-day plant, majority-owned by Suncor
Energy , cut its production for all of April to zero
after a fire in March damaged the facility and forced the
operator to bring forward planned maintenance.

However, it expects to return to operations in the first
week of May, albeit at reduced rates. [nL2N1HD227]

The Syncrude outage also left oil sands producers scrambling
for supply. These producers use Syncrude's synthetic crude for
mixing with tarry bitumen to create a heavy crude blend.

ConocoPhillips  and Nexen Energy, a wholly owned
subsidiary of CNOOC Ltd <0883.HK>, both cut production as a
result. [nL2N1HE1CG]

Western Canada Select heavy blend crude for May delivery
last traded at $9.50 per barrel below the West Texas
Intermediate benchmark, according to Shorcan Energy brokers.

On Thursday, WCS settled at $9.75 per barrel below U.S.
crude, having touched $9.30 below in intraday trade.

Planned maintenance elsewhere in northern Alberta added to
the tight supply picture. Suncor Energy's  180,000 bpd
Firebag is scheduled for turnaround in the second quarter and
late spring is when most seasonal maintenance takes place.

By Nia Williams and Catherine Ngai

CALGARY, Alberta/NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - Two oil sands producers in northern Alberta have cut production at their facilities due to a shortage of synthetic crude, market sources said on Thursday, causing Canadian and U.S. crude prices to surge to multi-year highs.

Synthetic supplies are scarce following a fire at the 350,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Syncrude plant in March that damaged the facility and forced the operator to bring forward maintenance and cut production for April to zero. [nL2N1GS10S]

As a result ConocoPhillips reduced output at its 140,000 bpd Surmont project, a joint venture with Total E&P Canada , by 40 percent, two market sources said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak to the media.

The company mixes synthetic crude from Syncrude with tarry bitumen from its oil sands reservoir to create a heavy crude blend known as "synbit" that can flow through pipelines.

CNOOC Ltd <0883.HK> subsidiary Nexen Energy, which likewise uses synthetic crude to dilute its bitumen, cut output from its Long Lake oil sands project this month by 48 percent, said one of the two sources, as well as two separate sources.

Long Lake usually produces around 40,000 bpd of undiluted bitumen, one source said.

ConocoPhillips spokeswoman Michelle McCullagh, who earlier this week confirmed that the Syncrude outage affected Surmont output, declined to comment on the size of the production cut.

Nexen Energy spokeswoman Brittney Price said her company does not publish production or maintenance operations for individual assets.

Syncrude, a joint venture majority-owned by Suncor Energy Inc , is expected to return to operations the first week of May but will be running at reduced rates that month, trading sources said on Wednesday. [nL2N1HD227]

The oil sands outages have boosted Canadian heavy crude prices, with the benchmark Western Canada Select blend for May delivery last trading close to a 22-month high of $9.60 a barrel below U.S. crude, according to Shorcan Energy brokers.

On Wednesday WCS settled at $9.85 per barrel below U.S. crude.

Meanwhile, Mars Sour traded up to $1.20 a barrel discount to U.S. crude on Thursday, the narrowest discount since September 2015, according to Reuters data. Light Louisiana Sweet traded up to $2.35 a barrel over WTI, the widest premium since March 2016.

RBC, JPMorgan lead Canadian equity advisory in first quarter - 路透新闻

{{20170406T110002.045+0000}}RBC, JPMorgan lead Canadian equity advisory in first quarterBy John Tilak

TORONTO, April 6 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Canada , JPMorgan and Bank of Montreal took the top three positions advising on Canadian equity issues in the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data released on Thursday.

The volume slipped about 13 percent to C$12.9 billion ($9.6 billion) from year-earlier levels, the figures showed. Toronto Dominion and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce finished fourth and fifth, respectively.

The five biggest deals of the quarter were in the energy sector, led by Cenovus Energy Inc's C$3 billion offering to help fund its acquisition of oil sands and natural gas assets from ConocoPhillips , followed by AltaGas Ltd's C$2.2 billion issue tied to its purchase of WGL Holdings . [nL3N1H65JB][nL4N1FF5NW]

RBC and JPMorgan were advisors on both those deals, and TD helped advise the AltaGas offering.

Initial public offerings rebounded after a lackluster 2016, with Freshii Inc and Canada Goose Holdings Inc listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange. [nL2N1GT0YP]

"We're seeing a resurgence of the IPO market in Canada. There's a ton of interest in non-resource names," said Benoit Lauzé, head of equity capital markets at CIBC.

"We feel the environment is much more stable than it was a year ago," added Lauzé, who advised on both the Freshii and Canada Goose offerings.

CIBC and RBC were jointly ranked No. 1 for advising on initial public offerings in the quarter.

JPMorgan's No. 2 ranking for overall equity issuance was the best performance by a foreign bank in Canadian equity capital markets since the second quarter of 2013.

"It does show you that for certain transactions, having a global bank leading or joint leading an equity offering can provide real value," said David Rawlings, head of JPMorgan Canada.

Rawlings said JPMorgan has been building its equity capabilities in Canada for the last three or four years.

The energy sector represented about 50 percent of new equity issues in the quarter, said Kirby Gavelin, head of equity capital markets at RBC Capital Markets.

"Acquisition-related financing was robust across all sectors," he added.

JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs top Canadian M&A rankings as activity rises - 路透新闻

{{20170406T110001.718+0000}}JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs top Canadian M&A rankings as activity risesBy John Tilak

TORONTO, April 6 (Reuters) - Canadian mergers and acquisitions got off to their strongest start in 17 years in 2017 as cross-border deal activity picked up pace, with JPMorgan , Goldman Sachs and RBC taking the top three spots in the advisory rankings.

Foreign banks further consolidated their position in Canadian deal-making as companies looked beyond borders for growth opportunities. [nL2N1GY0DB] Toronto Dominion and Lazard rounded out the top five positions in the league tables, according to Thomson Reuters data released on Thursday.

Deal value in the first quarter of 2017 jumped 12 percent to $75.4 billion, making it the best first quarter only behind the same period in 2000. Sizeable cross-border deals included AltaGas Ltd's planned acquisition of WGL Holdings for C$8.4 billion ($6.25 billion), and MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates Ltd's C$3.1 billion deal buy U.S.-based satellite imagery provider DigitalGlobe Inc .

"The results are reflective of the strong market we have for cross-border deals," said David Rawlings, head of JPMorgan Canada.

Canadian companies "certainly want exposure to the United States. Our clients want to diversify outside of Canada," he added.

Energy sector deals dominated the league tables, with domestic oil companies scooping assets of foreign oil majors. ConocoPhillips agreed to sell its oil sands and natural gas assets to Cenovus Energy Inc for C$17.2 billion, while Royal Dutch Shell offloaded most of its Canadian oil sands assets for $8.5 billion. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd was the main buyer of those assets.

"The large energy deals are strategic, chessboard-type transactions," said Brian Hanson, chief executive of Lazard's Canadian investment banking division.

"We expect more energy activity and more energy consolidation, but it may not be in a straight line, particularly if energy prices are volatile," he added.

The robust first-quarter performance in Canadian M&A follows an impressive 2016, when deal volume hit a nine-year high. [nL1N1EV00F]. Bankers are betting on more deals.

"We remain optimistic that 2017 will be a good year for Canadian M&A," said Peter Buzzi, co-head of M&A at RBC Capital Markets.

"Equity markets are close to their all-time highs and interest rates are still low by historical standards, notwithstanding the run-up since the U.S. election." ($1 = 1.3431 Canadian dollars)

CANADA CRUDE-Heavy grades jump on oil sands production outages - 路透新闻

{{20170405T220140.649+0000}}CANADA CRUDE-Heavy grades jump on oil sands production outages* May WCS trades at $9.85/bbl below WTI

* May synthetic trades at $5.40/bbl above WTI

(Adds expected Syncrude restart, updates prices)

By Nia Williams

CALGARY, Alberta, April 5 (Reuters) - Benchmark Canadian
heavy crude prices surged on Wednesday, with the discount to
U.S. crude narrowing below $10 for the first time since June
2015, as production cuts in northern Alberta's oil sands left
traders scrambling to secure supply.

Light synthetic crude prices also traded near their highest
premium in almost four years because of an outage at the
Syncrude mining and upgrading project that has roiled crude
markets on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border.

Western Canada Select heavy blend crude for May delivery
 climbed to $9.85 per barrel below the West Texas
Intermediate benchmark, according to Shorcan Energy brokers,
having settled at $10.15 per barrel below WTI on Tuesday.

ConocoPhillips'  140,000 barrel per day Surmont oil
sands plant has been forced to curb production because the
outage at Syncrude means Surmont cannot get hold of the light
synthetic crude it mixes into its bitumen to create a heavy
blend that can flow in pipelines. [nL2N1HC1PW]

A ConocoPhillips spokeswoman did not give details on how
much production had been impacted.

Meanwhile, Suncor Energy's  180,000 bpd Firebag oil
sands project is undergoing planned maintenance, further
limiting available heavy supply in the Alberta market.

The 350,000 bpd Syncrude mining and upgrading project cut
production of light synthetic crude for all of April to zero
after a fire last month damaged the facility and forced the
operator to bring planned maintenance forward.

Syncrude is expected to restart operations in the first week
of May and will run at partial rates that month, according to
three sources familiar with the matter. Output for May is
expected to be around 5 million barrels, which is nearly 50
percent of capacity, they said. [nL2N1HD213]

A Syncrude spokesman declined to comment.

Light synthetic crude from the oil sands for May delivery
last traded at $5.40 per barrel over the U.S. crude benchmark,
dipping slightly from Tuesday's settle of $5.55 per barrel over.

Last week, in illiquid trade, it settled at $6.00 a barrel
over WTI, the heftiest premium since June 2013.

Syncrude is majority-owned by Suncor, while Imperial Oil
 provides operational, technical and business management
support.

CANADA CRUDE-Heavy grades jump on oil sands production outages - 路透新闻

{{20170405T162941.490+0000}}CANADA CRUDE-Heavy grades jump on oil sands production outages* May WCS trades at $9.85/bbl below WTI

* May synthetic trades at $5.45/bbl above WTI

CALGARY, Alberta, April 5 (Reuters) - Benchmark Canadian
heavy crude prices surged on Wednesday, with the discount to
U.S. crude narrowing below $10 for the first time since June
2015, as production cuts in northern Alberta's oil sands left
traders scrambling to secure supply.

Light synthetic crude prices also traded near their highest
premium in almost four years because of an outage at the
Syncrude mining and upgrading project that has roiled crude
markets on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border.

Western Canada Select heavy blend crude for May delivery
 climbed to $9.85 per barrel below the West Texas
Intermediate benchmark in mid-morning trade, according to
Shorcan Energy brokers, having settled at $10.15 per barrel
below WTI on Tuesday.

ConocoPhillips'  140,000 barrel per day Surmont oil
sands plant has been forced to curb production because the
outage at Syncrude means Surmont cannot get hold of the light
synthetic crude it mixes into it bitumen to create a heavy blend
that can flow on pipelines. [nL2N1HC1PW]

A ConocoPhillips spokeswoman did not give details on how
much production had been impacted.

Meanwhile, Suncor Energy's  180,000 bpd Firebag oil
sands project is undergoing planned maintenance, further
limiting available heavy supply in the Alberta market.

The 350,000 bpd Syncrude mining and upgrading project cut
production of light synthetic crude for all of April to zero
after a fire last month damaged the facility and forced the
operator to bring planned maintenance forward.

Light synthetic crude from the oil sands for May delivery
last traded at $5.45 per barrel over the U.S. crude benchmark,
dipping slightly from Tuesday's settle of $5.55 per barrel over.

Last week, in illiquid trade, it settled at $6.00 a barrel
over WTI, the heftiest premium since June 2013.

Syncrude is majority-owned by Suncor, while Imperial Oil
 provides operational, technical and business management
support.

UPDATE 2-Syncrude outage limits ConocoPhillips oil sands production - 路透新闻

{{20170404T211932.252+0000}}UPDATE 2-Syncrude outage limits ConocoPhillips oil sands production(Adds overall Canadian crude production, details on Firebag maintenance, updates heavy price)

By Nia Williams

CALGARY, Alberta, April 4 (Reuters) - A shutdown at the Syncrude oil sands facility in northern Alberta has curbed output from ConocoPhillips' Surmont plant, the U.S. company said on Tuesday, as the shortage helped push heavy Canadian crude prices to the narrowest discount in nearly two years.

The 350,000 barrel-per-day Syncrude project cut production for all of April to zero, according to market sources, following a fire last month that damaged the facility and forced the operator to bring forward planned maintenance. [nL2N1HB0WZ]

ConocoPhillips has had to reduce production at its 140,000 bpd Surmont thermal plant because it uses light synthetic crude from Syncrude, one of the largest producers in Canada's oil sands, to dilute tarry bitumen into a heavy blend that can flow through pipelines.

"(The) Syncrude outage has had an impact on our output, but we are working with suppliers to understand the timeline as the Syncrude owners work towards a full recovery," ConocoPhillips Canada spokeswoman Michelle McCullagh said in an email.

She did not specify the reduction in crude volume, but combined with the Syncrude outage, up to 490,000 bpd, or nearly one fifth, of the oil sands' 2.5 million bpd of supply is potentially off the market.

On top of that Suncor Energy's 180,000 bpd Firebag thermal plant is also undergoing planned maintenance this quarter, adding to the shortage of heavy crude.

Canada produces around 4 million bpd and exports about 3.1 million bpd, almost entirely to the United States.

Prices for heavy and synthetic Canadian crude have surged on tight supply and extended gains on Tuesday.

Western Canada Select heavy blend crude for May delivery last traded at $10.15 per barrel below the West Texas Intermediate benchmark, according to Shorcan Energy Brokers, the smallest discount since June 2015.

Light synthetic crude from the oil sands for May delivery last traded at $5.30 per barrel over WTI, having settled at $4.85 per barrel over the benchmark on Monday.

Syncrude is a joint venture majority-owned by Suncor Energy Inc , while Imperial Oil Ltd provides operational, technical and business management support.

ConocoPhillips says Syncrude outage impacting Surmont oil sands output - 路透新闻

{{20170404T185716.877+0000}}ConocoPhillips says Syncrude outage impacting Surmont oil sands outputCALGARY, Alberta, April 4 (Reuters) - The production outage at the Syncrude oil sands facility in northern Alberta has impacted output from ConocoPhillips's 140,000 barrel-per-day Surmont thermal oil sands plant, a ConocoPhillips spokeswoman said on Tuesday.

Two traders in Calgary said Surmont mixes light synthetic crude from Syncrude with tarry bitumen to create a heavy crude blend that can flow through pipelines to market.

U.S. LNG exports will slow as domestic gas demand grows -ConocoPhillips CEO - 路透新闻

{{20170404T034540.483+0000}}U.S. LNG exports will slow as domestic gas demand grows -ConocoPhillips CEOCHIBA, April 4 (Reuters) - Exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States will slow as domestic gas demand there grows and available supply there is used up, said ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance at a gas industry conference on Tuesday in Chiba, Japan.

"By the mid-2020s, the existing brownfield supply expansion options will be exhausted both in the U.S. and other countries. New greenfield projects will be needed," Lance said.

"To justify those investments, higher energy prices will be required," he said.

As supplies grow tighter, he added, the industry will also need to return to longer term contracts that provide security of supply for end-users and security of demand for suppliers.

UPDATE 2-Syncrude outage limits ConocoPhillips oil sands production - 路透新闻

{{20170404T211932.252+0000}}UPDATE 2-Syncrude outage limits ConocoPhillips oil sands production(Adds overall Canadian crude production, details on Firebag maintenance, updates heavy price)

By Nia Williams

CALGARY, Alberta, April 4 (Reuters) - A shutdown at the Syncrude oil sands facility in northern Alberta has curbed output from ConocoPhillips' Surmont plant, the U.S. company said on Tuesday, as the shortage helped push heavy Canadian crude prices to the narrowest discount in nearly two years.

The 350,000 barrel-per-day Syncrude project cut production for all of April to zero, according to market sources, following a fire last month that damaged the facility and forced the operator to bring forward planned maintenance. [nL2N1HB0WZ]

ConocoPhillips has had to reduce production at its 140,000 bpd Surmont thermal plant because it uses light synthetic crude from Syncrude, one of the largest producers in Canada's oil sands, to dilute tarry bitumen into a heavy blend that can flow through pipelines.

"(The) Syncrude outage has had an impact on our output, but we are working with suppliers to understand the timeline as the Syncrude owners work towards a full recovery," ConocoPhillips Canada spokeswoman Michelle McCullagh said in an email.

She did not specify the reduction in crude volume, but combined with the Syncrude outage, up to 490,000 bpd, or nearly one fifth, of the oil sands' 2.5 million bpd of supply is potentially off the market.

On top of that Suncor Energy's 180,000 bpd Firebag thermal plant is also undergoing planned maintenance this quarter, adding to the shortage of heavy crude.

Canada produces around 4 million bpd and exports about 3.1 million bpd, almost entirely to the United States.

Prices for heavy and synthetic Canadian crude have surged on tight supply and extended gains on Tuesday.

Western Canada Select heavy blend crude for May delivery last traded at $10.15 per barrel below the West Texas Intermediate benchmark, according to Shorcan Energy Brokers, the smallest discount since June 2015.

Light synthetic crude from the oil sands for May delivery last traded at $5.30 per barrel over WTI, having settled at $4.85 per barrel over the benchmark on Monday.

Syncrude is a joint venture majority-owned by Suncor Energy Inc , while Imperial Oil Ltd provides operational, technical and business management support.

ConocoPhillips says Syncrude outage impacting Surmont oil sands output - 路透新闻

{{20170404T185716.877+0000}}ConocoPhillips says Syncrude outage impacting Surmont oil sands outputCALGARY, Alberta, April 4 (Reuters) - The production outage at the Syncrude oil sands facility in northern Alberta has impacted output from ConocoPhillips's 140,000 barrel-per-day Surmont thermal oil sands plant, a ConocoPhillips spokeswoman said on Tuesday.

Two traders in Calgary said Surmont mixes light synthetic crude from Syncrude with tarry bitumen to create a heavy crude blend that can flow through pipelines to market.

U.S. LNG exports will slow as domestic gas demand grows -ConocoPhillips CEO - 路透新闻

{{20170404T034540.483+0000}}U.S. LNG exports will slow as domestic gas demand grows -ConocoPhillips CEOCHIBA, April 4 (Reuters) - Exports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States will slow as domestic gas demand there grows and available supply there is used up, said ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance at a gas industry conference on Tuesday in Chiba, Japan.

"By the mid-2020s, the existing brownfield supply expansion options will be exhausted both in the U.S. and other countries. New greenfield projects will be needed," Lance said.

"To justify those investments, higher energy prices will be required," he said.

As supplies grow tighter, he added, the industry will also need to return to longer term contracts that provide security of supply for end-users and security of demand for suppliers.
