Tesla,2025-06-24,The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Tuesday that it has asked Tesla for information about the apparent errors.
Tesla,2025-06-24,"Though many other videos show robotaxis driving perfectly, if regulators find any major issues, that would likely raise questions about Musk’s repeated statements that the robotaxis are safe and his claim that Tesla will dominate a future in which nearly all cars on road will have no one behind the wheel — or even need a steering wheel at all."
Tesla,2025-06-24,"Passengers in Tesla robotaxis on the road in Austin, Texas, have generally been impressed, and the stock rose 8% Monday."
Tesla,2025-06-24,Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Tesla,2025-06-24,A bullish Tesla financial analyst who was driven around in a robotaxi on Sunday when the test runs began said his ride was perfect and suggested the videos on X and YouTube showing errors were no big deal.
Tesla,2025-06-24,"“The system has always had highly erratic performance, working really well a lot of the time but frequently making random and inconsistent but dangerous errors,” said Sam Abuelsamid in a text, referring to Tesla’s self-driving software."
Tesla,2025-06-24,"“This is not a system that should be carrying members of the public or being tested on public roads without trained test drivers behind the wheel.”  In one video, a Tesla moves into a lane with a big yellow arrow indicating it is for left turns only but then goes straight through the intersection instead, entering an opposing lane on the other side."
Tesla,2025-06-24,But the Tesla proceeds in the opposing lane for 10 seconds.
Tesla,2025-06-24,"“I didn’t feel uncomfortable in the situation.”  Another video shows a Tesla stopping twice suddenly in the middle of the road, possibly responding to the flashing lights of police cars."
Tesla,2025-06-24,"But the police are obviously not interested in the Tesla or traffic in front or behind it because they have parked on side roads not near it, apparently responding to an unrelated event."

Tesla,2025-06-24,"(AP Photo/Eric Gay) A rider boards a driverless Tesla robotaxi, a ride-booking service, Sunday, June 22, 2025, in Austin, Texas."
Tesla,2025-06-24,Tesla was forced a recall 2.4 million of its vehicles at the time.
Amazon,2025-06-24,"Other self-driving companies have launched taxis, including Amazon’s Zoox and current market leader Waymo, which is not only is picking up passengers in Austin, but several other cities."
Tesla,2025-06-24,"His work on in Trump administration as cost-cutting czar has alienated many buyers among Tesla’s traditional environmentally conscious and liberal base in the U.S., tanking sales."
Tesla,2025-06-25,These observers expressed a range of views about Tesla’s prospects but all cautioned against assuming a light-speed robotaxi rollout.
Tesla,2025-06-25,Some pointed to advantages Tesla might exploit to overtake rivals including Alphabet’s Waymo and a host of Chinese auto and tech companies.
Tesla,2025-06-25,"Tesla has mass-manufacturing capacity, and it pioneered remote software updates it can use for self-driving upgrades."
Tesla,2025-06-25,"If the software works, Tesla robotaxi could drive any road in the world,” said Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar senior equity analyst, while cautioning that Tesla is still “testing the product.”  In Austin, Tesla launched a choreographed experiment involving maybe a dozen cars, operating in limited geography, with safety monitors in the front passenger seat; remote “teleoperators”; plans to avoid bad weather; and hand-picked pro-Tesla influencers as passengers."
Tesla,2025-06-25,"For years, Musk has said Tesla would soon operate its own autonomous ride-hailing service and also turn any Tesla, new or used, into a cash-generating robotaxi for its customers."
Tesla,2025-06-25,"Musk has said Tesla will reach Mars, in that metaphor, quite quickly: ""I predict that there will be millions of Teslas operating fully autonomously in the second half of next year,"" he said in April."
Tesla,2025-06-25,Musk and Tesla did not respond to requests for comment.
Tesla,2025-06-25,Tesla shares ended 8.2% higher at $348.68 on Monday on investor enthusiasm over the robotaxi launch.
Tesla,2025-06-25,"Given Tesla’s AI-dependent approach, its challenge will be machine-training robotaxis to handle complex traffic “edge cases,” said Philip Koopman, a Carnegie Mellon University computer-engineering professor and autonomous-technology expert."
Tesla,2025-06-25,"“There's no reason to believe Tesla will be any faster.”  LONG SLOG  Waymo’s self-driving efforts date back to 2009, when Google started its self-driving car project."
Tesla,2025-06-25,"Some analysts believe Tesla can expand faster, in part because Waymo has helped pave the way by overcoming regulatory and technical challenges."
Tesla,2025-06-25,"Being a mass-manufacturer also helps Tesla, Miller said."
Tesla,2025-06-25,Waymo buys Jaguar I-PACE SUVs and outfits them with more expensive sensors and technology than Tesla integrates into its vehicles.
Tesla,2025-06-25,Waymo declined to comment on Tesla's robotaxi-expansion potential.
Tesla,2025-06-25,"The precautions Tesla employed in Austin reveal it does not have confidence its technology is safe at scale, Krafcik said."
Tesla,2025-06-25,"“It’s not as safe as it needs to be, and falls well short of the robust approach and well-documented safety that Waymo has demonstrated.”  ‘WRONG SIDE’ OF THE ROAD  Tesla’s go-fast strategy could actually slow its progress and that of the autonomous-vehicle industry if it undermines public trust, some analysts said."
Tesla,2025-06-25,"Tesla has historically faced legal and regulatory trouble involving its Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver-assistance system, which is not fully autonomous."
Tesla,2025-06-25,"In one recent federal safety probe into Tesla, investigators are examining FSD’s role in crashes – some fatal – involving rain or other inclement weather that interferes with the system’s cameras."
Tesla,2025-06-25,"Before the Austin test, Musk posted on his social-media platform, X, that the robotaxis’ technology would differ little from any Tesla, aside from a software update: “These are unmodified Tesla cars coming straight from the factory, meaning that every Tesla,” he wrote, “is capable of unsupervised self-driving!”  The automaker invited Tesla-friendly influencers to take its first robotaxi rides, and they generally cheered the experience."
Tesla,2025-06-25,"Separately, a Reuters witness followed another Tesla robotaxi and measured its speed as it traveled at between 40 and 45 mph in a 35 mph zone on First Street, adjacent to the Texas School for the Deaf."
Tesla,2025-06-24,"“Culmination of a decade of hard work.”  The kickoff – which comes as Musk refocuses on his business ventures following a contentious stint in Donald Trump’s administration – will employ the Model Y sport utility vehicle rather than Tesla’s much-touted Cybercab, which is still under development."
Tesla,2025-06-24,"Since then, Musk has publicly expressed regret for some of his statements, while his company’s Texas operation has readied the Austin push – part of a major drive on autonomous technology and artificial intelligence that Tesla believes will yield huge profits."
Tesla,2025-06-24,"“There are countless skeptics of the Tesla robotaxi vision with many bears thinking this day would never come,” said Ives, who predicted Trump’s administration would clear roadblocks for Tesla and pivot from the recent “soap opera.”  One of the robotaxi’s self-described first users was Tesla fan Herbert Ong, who livestreamed his ride Sunday in a red vehicle that included a person in the passenger seat monitoring the trip for operational safety."
Tesla,2025-06-24,The unveiling in the Texas state capital comes amid questions about how Tesla will try to overcome criticism of Musk’s activities for Trump.
Tesla,2025-06-24,Tesla saw profits plunge 71% in the first quarter following poor sales in several markets.
Tesla,2025-06-24,"The Texas legislature this year passed a bill requiring prior authorization from the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles before companies can operate on a public street without human drivers, a group of Democratic lawmakers said in a June 18 letter to Tesla."
Tesla,2025-06-24,"Citing the enhanced system, the lawmakers asked Tesla to delay testing until after the law takes effect on September 1."
Tesla,2025-06-24,The lawmakers asked for “detailed information demonstrating that Tesla will be compliant with the new law” should the company choose to proceed.
Tesla,2025-06-24,"“We want to deliberately take it slow,” Musk said May 20 on CNBC, telling the network that Tesla would probably only operate 10 autonomous vehicles the first week."
Tesla,2025-06-24,Tesla’s robotaxi launch comes well after Waymo’s offering of commercial robotaxi service.
Tesla,2025-06-24,The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in October 2024 opened a probe into Tesla’s Full Self-Driving software after receiving four reports of crashes.
Tesla,2025-06-24,Last month the agency asked Tesla for additional information on its technology in light of the Austin launch.
Tesla,2025-06-25,"A few online influencers were given early access to the long-promised Robotaxi service, allowing them to hail a ride  Austin in Texas has become the first city in the world to see Tesla’s self-driving Robotaxi in action."
Tesla,2025-06-25,Tesla hopes to regain its footing in the stock market since taking a pummeling for a few months after its CEO Elon Musk dedicated most of his time first towards supporting US president Donald Trump’s election campaign last year and then by taking on the role of DOGE (the body tasked with reducing US government spending and cutting jobs) leader (he stepped away a few weeks ago).
Tesla,2025-06-25,"One X user, who goes by the name Bearded Tesla, showed the empty driver seat during a trip in a red Model Y SUV that lasted slightly over 10 minutes."
Tesla,2025-06-25,"The first trips were restricted to a portion of Tesla’s hometown, with an employee in each vehicle keeping track of the operations."
Tesla,2025-06-25,"Herbert Ong, who is behind a fan account, spoke about the speed of the vehicle and the ability to park autonomously, while another influencer, with the @BLKMDL3 handle on X, said the trip was “smoother than a human driver.”  Tesla has relied on word-of-mouth publicity to get the Robotaxi launch off the ground."
Tesla,2025-06-25,"Rides are, at the moment, limited to a geofenced area of the city and, as a precautionary measure, in some cases, Tesla is using chase cars and remote drivers as additional backup."
Tesla,2025-06-25,"Since pro-Tesla influencers have received invites, reactions from the tech community have been critical."
Tesla,2025-06-25,Tesla hasn’t said when the service will be available to the general public.
Tesla,2025-06-25,"Musk is pinning the turnaround for Tesla on cars running on unproven technologies, including self-driving vehicles."
Tesla,2025-06-25,"At the same time, some investors are hoping for new markets to revive Tesla following a sales slump and consumer backlash against Musk."
Tesla,2025-06-25,"For Musk, Tesla’s rollout has been slow."
Tesla,2025-06-25,"“So, we will start with probably 10 for a week, then increase it to 20, 30, 40.” He plans to have 1,000 Tesla robotaxis on Austin roads “within a few months” followed by expansion to other cities in Texas and California."
Tesla,2025-06-25,"Three years later, he said that Tesla customers would be able to utilise their vehicles as Robotaxis by 2020."
Google,2025-06-25,"Waymo, which is owned by Google parent Alphabet, is scaling up in the city through a partnership with Uber."
Amazon,2025-06-25,Amazon’s Zoox is also testing there.
